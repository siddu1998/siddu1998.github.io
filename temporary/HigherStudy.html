            Hello! If you are here you possibly are planning for your higher studies or atleast considering it. 
            I have donned the exact same hat you have right now in 2019, 2020 and this hat comes with a lot of questions and 
            uncertainities. I have taken weeks to put this blog to answer most possible questions and also open up directions for you to think upon.
            <text style='color:red'>WARNING:</text> This blog is going to super long because I have decided to cover from ground Zero (from What is Masters?) to the Final Visa Process. So get a coffee to sip while you read along!
            Oh! Why bother to read! Like who is this stranger throwing all his advice! Well I have recived my admits from Cornell, GeorgiaTech, USC, UCSC and University of Adelaide! I got waitlisted in Columbia and Brown before they turned to rejections! So going through all this I am sure I can offer some advice on how you can improve your chance in acing the process.
        </p>

        <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge" style="color:black"><b>What all can I do?</b></h1>
        <p style='margin-right: 100px;font-size: 25px;'>

            I have come across many people who want to pursue a Masters program to enhance their skill but are have second thoughts since they are not interested in research or writing a Masters thesis.
            Well there is good news. You can choose not to write a thesis and instead work on a capstone project. Yes! you heard me right. Most universities give you the opportunity to work on a capstone 
            project instead of a thesis. The term Masters is analogus to Bachelors. You might recive a Bachelors in Technology (B.Tech) or Bachelors in Engineering (B.Eng) simillarly almost every university has 
            an M.S (Masters in Science Program) and a M.Eng (Masters in Engineering) program. The M.S program might compel you to have a thesis and have some research component involved (but you can always talk to the Department Chair and work on a Capstone). While the M.Eng program is more industry oriented
            and does not require a research contribution or reserach work form your end. So next time you are searching for programs make sure you know what kind of programs you want to go for! Now, stop thinking about
            M.S v.s M.Eng, ofcourse I will cover it in the subsequent secations! Duh. Other degrees within the scope of Masters are M.Phil and M.Math these are popular in Canada and Europe. The Crux of this paragraph is check out other Masters programs also and dont blindly run behind the MS program.

        </p>
        <p style='margin-right: 100px;font-size: 25px;'>
            The Ph.D. program or the Doctoral Program is a reserach intensive program and definently not recommended to people who are not interesed in research. 
            That said universities in Australia and Europe have recently come up with Industry Oriented Ph.Ds where you would be working closely with a company and solve their problems.
            It is a common myth that you need to have a Masters degree before going for a Ph.D. well guess what! You do not need it for most Ph.D. programs in the United States of America.
            It is very common for Universities and Professors to recruit Ph.D. students straight from their Bachelors! (I got into a direct Ph.D. without my Masters program!). This might not be a common
            in Australia and Europe. So if you have the appropriate research experience and material to support your application and you see yourself as a Ph.D. student in the future it is definently worth a shot applying for a Ph.D. straight after your Bachelors. 
            We will get back on how to go about the application process in the subsequent sections for a Ph.D.
        </p>

        <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge" style="color:black"><b>What Exams Do I need to Give?</b></h1>
        <p style='margin-right: 100px;font-size: 25px;'>
          Most Universities have a set of examination scores you must provide in your application package. The most common exams accepted by the Universities are 
          GRE to evaluate your analytical and language skills followed by TOEFL/IELTS or exams testing your communication skills accepted by the university. Students mostly choose the GRE+TOEFL or GRE+IELTS path since TOEFL and IELTS are accepted almost everywhere. 
          The GRE is an exam conducted by an organization called ETS. Most universities never set hard-coded cut offs for the GRE and promise a holistic evaluation. But the fact is having a higher GRE score 
          is a big plus. Having a lower GRE score does not cut your chances of but definently hurts the entire application. On the other hand universtiies set cut offs for TOEFL and IELTS. Most universities even 
          go ahead to set section wise cut offs for TOEFL and IELTS. If you are looking for scholarships, Research Assistant Ships or Teaching Assistant Ships make sure you have a clear all the cut offs set for these language 
          exams.
      </p>
      <p style='margin-right: 100px;font-size: 25px;'>
      Honestly, these are not tough exams. The preparation required for this exams is extremely hyped. 
      There is an entire industry minting money with the hype required to prepare for this exams. I have gone through
      grind myself and had number of friends who had taken this exam. After discussing with a lot of people this is all you will ever need 
      to sail through your GRE exam.

      You can go through a bunch of other subscriptions like The Hindu, Economic Times etc. But I never found the time or interest to read through those papers. Covering the above material,
      and understanding the reasoning behind approaches shown in the above material should put you on par to score a very competative GRE score. Start with a mock test (easily avilable online).
      Understand areas you screwed up. Do not enter panic mode if you see a super low verbal score in your mock. The ideal target is to aim for a full score in the quantitative section and stretch your limit in the verbal section.
      The key to getting a good score is being consistent in your preparation. A 10 day gap in your preparation will pull you back to ground zero. The best way to start preaparing after the mock test is to book an examination date.
      Only if you book a date, you are most likely to keep being consistent in your preparation. Set aside 3-4 hours a day for your preparation. Keep memorizing words on a daily basis regulary keep giving mock tests. Never ignore the AWA part while giving your mock tests,
      since there are plenty of cases where students went on to score a 320+ but failed to qualify the minimum AWA score set by some universities.

    <p style='margin-right: 100px;font-size: 25px;'>
    I will keep away from IELTS because I have never given it. TOEFL is a four section exam. Reading, Listening, Talking and Writing are the four sections in TOEFL. Your preparation for the Reading and Writing section of 
    TOEFL is covered when you prepare for GRE. In the listening section you are given a series of conversations and are followed up with questions based on that conversation. The speaking section you are given certain topics/discussions between people 
    and you are asked to speak out your opinion about it. A great resource for preparing for TOEFL is "NOTEFUL". Do not go behind other expensive material and coaching, spending time on "NOTEFUL" should put you on track to score a very competative score clearning all the required cut offs.

Warning: Long Post
If you are here you possibly are planning for your higher studies or at least considering it. I have donned the same hat you have right now in 2019, 2020 and this hat comes with a lot of questions and uncertainties. I have taken weeks to put this post together to answer possible questions and also open up directions for you to think upon. This post is going to be super long because I have decided to cover ground Zero (from What is Masters?) to the Final Visa Process. So get a coffee to sip while you read along. Oh! Why bother to read!

So going through all this I am sure I can offer some advice on how you can improve your chance in acing the process.
What are the different kinds of Programs I can Apply to?
I have come across many people who want to pursue a Masters's program to enhance their skills but have second thoughts since they are not interested in research or writing a Masters's thesis. Well, there is good news. You can choose not to write a thesis and instead work on a capstone project. Yes! you heard me right. Most universities allow you to work on a capstone project instead of a thesis. The term Masters is analogous to a Bachelor's. You might receive a Bachelors in Technology (B.Tech) or Bachelors in Engineering (B.Eng) similarly almost every university has an M.S (Masters in Science Program) and an M.Eng (Masters in Engineering) program.

What is an Ideal Timeline for the Whole Process?
There is definitely no deadline-based checklist you need to keep following for the entire process. But knowing the whole process helps you plan ahead. Below is an image I put walking through the entire process. Having an understanding of the image below allows you to assess where you are currently and should allow you to plan ahead. Having the complete set of requirements ahead of your preparation should help you see the bigger picture and prepare well. So do spend some time on the below timeline. The timeline also mentions some important documents you would need during the entire application.

A Possible Timeline you can use for your Graduate Admissions
What do I apply for M.Eng or M.S?
The answer to this question lies in your objectives. The M.Eng program allows you to take more subjects and prepares you well for work. The M.Eng does not have a research component, but you can always talk to the department and connect with a professor to pick up research projects. It is possible to take the M.S. program and forfeit the thesis and take extra electives or pick up a capstone project. You would need to check with the academic section of your university if they allow you to forfeit a thesis. Going to a research-based program increases your chances of funding in the form of RAship. If your future goals are a Ph.D. it is highly recommended you go for the M.S. program and take part in the research. 
How to Pick Universities?
Picking the right set of universities and programs is tough. Going through the admissions process twice and getting better admits in the second session, here are some pointers which I feel might help you choose your universities. 
1. Apply to universities and programs where you make a strong case. For example, Assume you are a student in Robotics and have worked in health care and assistive robotics. Instead of applying for UPenn robotics, I would recommend applying for the GerogiaTech Robotics Program (which has amazing people for assistive robotics) or the Cornell Health Tech + IT program. The reason behind this, it allows you to make a strong case for yourself in the SOP. You can explicitly write your contributions to Healthcare, Robotics and mention how your previous experience aligns with the vision and goals of the University, a particular lab, or Professor.
2. Find people who passed out from the university on Linkedin and check what they are doing currently and evaluate is this where you see yourself in a few years.   
3. If you are someone who wants to get into the industry immediately a good internship always helps. Check if the university has a mandatory Co-Op program or at least allows students to go for internships in the summer.
4. University websites generally mention that they do not offer financial support for MS students. This might not always be the case. Check for current student profiles on Linkedin and see if they have taken up RAship or TAship opportunities. If yes, it is safe to assume you can also apply for the same possibly from the second semester (Note: these are highly competitive)
5. Another factor I like to consider is the ROI. When universities in your choice or similar ranked, go for the University with a lower fee. This helps you recover your investment quickly.
Despite all the points, I still believe Point Number 1 is the most essential when it comes to picking a University for Masters. For a Ph.D. it is highly recommended you go by the professor and reach out to them if they are hiring Ph.D. students and then apply. Professors generally set up a meeting with prospective Ph.D. students and understand your interests and how it might benefit the lab. If they are satisfied some professors outright mention that they would be having you in the next Semester, while other professors might recommend you to apply to the program. Other professors might respond that they are not hiring for the semester or mention that you might not be a good fit for the lab and their tentative projects.  Choosing universities for a Ph.D. is a mix between University reputation and Professor, where having a good professor to guide is my personal preference. 
Students go about applying for 10 universities (Note: Application fees for universities are quite expensive. Plus the cost required to send your GRE scores and TOEFL scores add up).  It is common for people to categorize universities into 3 sets namely Ambitious, Moderate and Safe. Now to which category a university belongs solely dependent on your profile. For example, GeorgiaTech which is a premier university might fall in the ambitious category for most people, but in my case, I had a Recommendation from a Professor at GeorgiaTech, and hence made me put GeorgiaTech in the moderate category. So evaluate your profile and see where you make a strong case. Based on that order I would recommend grouping universities. Some universities are CGPA centric. For example, consider USC it is known to pick a majority of students who have an undergraduate CGPA of 9.0. Despite your profile being stellar, there is a good chance you might miss out on a chance here so keep these open secrets in mind before applying and categorizing universities. Another piece of personal advice is when it comes to Safe universities prefer universities which are closer to cities with industries related to your field of interest.
