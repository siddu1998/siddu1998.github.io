    <p class="w3-large w3-text-black">The lifecycle of Robots are complex. To build robots Robots are complex. 
      Successful robots are build with the coordination of various teams distributed across sales, marketing, software and hardware. 
      This is complex. Where are the bottlenecks? How can we solve it? </p>

    <p class="w3-large">
    For this project I take the role of a "Researcher as an Engineer" and take part in the daily activities of the startup.
    Using UX research methods such of Ethnography, User Interviews, and Co-Design, I identify core problems and develop an
    prototype application covering various corners of the problems.

    We identified 5 major stakeholders that influence the lifecycle of a Robot.
  </p>
  <ul class="w3-large" style="margin-top: 0px;">
    <li>Sales and Marketing</li>
    <li>Software Engineering</li>
    <li>Hardware Engineering</li>

<h2 style="color:purple"><b>Methodology</b></h2>
<p class="w3-large" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
The project is generative in nature, hence we use the following research methods
</p>
<ul class="w3-large" style="margin-top: 0px;">
  <li>Ethnography</li>
  <li>Stakeholder Interviews</li>
  <li>Co-Design | Participatory Design</li>

</ul>

<h3 style="color: purple;"><b>Ethnography</b></h3>
<h2 style="color: rebeccapurple;">"I have no clue what the sales team promised the client for this robot, and I do not care I am just going to write basic code and fix it latter"</h2>
<p class="w3-large" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
As part of the ethnographic step I took the role as a "Researcher as an Engineer". I leveraged my engineering skills
to seamlessly fit into different teams across the firm. I took part in the daily team activities of both the software, hardware and deployment teams. 
While working I carried out conversations with the employees to understand where employees had problems.

Some of the problems Identified were:
</p>

<ul class="w3-large" style="margin-top: 0px;">
  <li>Lack of information communication between teams</li>
  <li>Lack of single point reference per robot</li>
  <li>Lack of agreement and awareness of protocols and standard operating procedures</li>
  <li>Assumption of domain expertise by teams. For example, deployment of robot involves high end software programs unfamiliar to the deployment team, creating serious bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 style="color: purple;"><b>Stakeholder Interviews</b></h3>
<h2 style="color: rebeccapurple;">"Yeah, I will need to talk with the sales team to understand what they are selling to the customers, and the software team to see what features they have at this point"</h2>

<p class="w3-large">To understand the perspective of leadership I conducted stakeholder interviews. I did 1:1 interviews
  to understand if they are aware of problems, faced by teams and robots. My questions were open ended and aimed to understand
  leaderships understanding of robot performance, customer insights and how teams are communicating between themselves. 
  We identified the following:
</p>

<ul class="w3-large" style="margin-top: 0px;">
  <li>Centralized information flow</li>
  <li>Lack of aggregation for actionable insights and resource distribution </li>
  <li>Lack of insight into what SOPs have been established and the efficacy of the SOPs</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 style="color: purple;"><b>Co-Design Activities</b></h3>
<h2 style="color: rebeccapurple;">"I can not send ROS commands, I do not get it. The deployment is very stressful with the client always on your head, it has to be simple. Something like this..."</h2>

<p class="w3-large">
  In this research activity we borrow a popular UI technique called Quick 8s (we were working with CEOs and busy employees hence stuck to quick 4s).
  We present users with 4 blank phone screens and ask them to sketch 4 screens that would help them in their work. 
  There is no right or wrong screen. Through this activity we were interested to know the most pressing problem and see
  an employees perspective towards solving the problem.

<small style="padding-left:40%;">Illustrations from the co-design activities</small>
<p class="w3-large">
  From the co-design activities we draw the following interpretations:
</p>
<ul class="w3-large" style="margin-top: 0px;">
  <li>Employees want minimal interaction but maximum information gain.</li>
  <li>Employees want simplified technical solutions.</li>
  <li>Leadership needs data aggregation, and better insight into robot performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color: purple;"><b>Design Suggestions</b></h3>
<p class="w3-large">In this project I was consulted for conducting research and understand bottlenecks in their production pipelines. 
  Supporting their design process post the insights I generated, I designed some prototypes shown below:
