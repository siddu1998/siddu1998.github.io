      <h2>The Challenge: Localizing Climate Reflection Through Faith</h2>
      <p>Despite the rising popularity of climate-themed games, most fail to connect deeply with faith-based communities. We saw an opportunity to harness familiar religious rituals and narratives to make climate action more emotionally and culturally resonant.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>We collected over 400 photographs and 40+ videos, observed rituals firsthand, and engaged in conversations with temple staff and pilgrims. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we coded this data to identify recurring climate-religion themes and extract rituals that could be reimagined as gameplay mechanics.</p>

  <p>From this research, we identified six key themes linking Hinduism to climate change: personification of nature, presence of climate deities, pilgrimage challenges due to weather, renewable efforts by temple authorities, structured waste management, and religious calls for climate action. These insights shaped both the narrative structure and game mechanics of <strong>Shloka</strong>.</p>

  <h2>The Game: Designing <em>Shloka</em></h2>
  <p>Guided by insights from our ethnographic fieldwork, we designed <strong>Shloka</strong>—a 2D platformer where players take on the role of a child guided by Hindu deities to solve climate challenges. The game draws upon rituals as both symbolic and mechanical elements to activate powers needed to restore sacred natural spaces.</p>

  <h3>Iterative, Participatory Design Process</h3>
  <p>We employed an iterative co-design methodology throughout the game's development. Our process included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consultations with temple priests and Hindu scholars</strong> to ensure religious sensitivity and authenticity in ritual representation.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback from climate game designers and educators</strong> to align our structure with the IGDA Climate Game Framework (Knowledge, Attitude, Efficacy, Hope).</li>
    <li><strong>Participatory prototyping sessions with Hindu players</strong> who shared how rituals like chanting, breathing, and offering prayers could feel authentic yet playful.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Across each iteration, we refined both the narrative tone and technical affordances—moving from deity control (rejected in early versions) to player-performed invocations as a respectful middle ground. We also shifted visual metaphors and level art to reflect temple architecture and pilgrimage routes derived from field observations.</p>

  <h3>Gameplay Overview</h3>
  <p>Each level is structured as a spiritual journey through a sacred site, mapping to real-world climate issues:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Level:</strong> Oil in Ganges — <em>Ritual:</em> Inscriptions — <em>God:</em> Varuna — <em>Power:</em> Trident to absorb oil</li>
    <li><strong>Level:</strong> Temple Waste — <em>Ritual:</em> Drumming — <em>God:</em> Kali — <em>Power:</em> Multiple arms to sort waste</li>
    <li><strong>Level:</strong> Hilltop Smog — <em>Ritual:</em> Fire Worship — <em>God:</em> Surya — <em>Power:</em> Light beam that clears smoke</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Players must perform ritual actions using multimodal inputs: Whisper for chant detection, Teachable Machine for mudras, Unity-integrated breath detection, and audio-based recognition for verse recitation. These are not just input tricks—they symbolically reflect the embodied actions tied to each god’s domain.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Each level ends with a hopeful message from the deity involved, tying gameplay into scripture and ecological advice. This reinforced both spiritual continuity and the framework’s final pillar: hope.</p>

      <h2>Evaluation: Comparing Ritual Gameplay with Climate Game Corpus</h2>
  <p>We evaluated <strong>Shloka</strong> using a within-subjects study with 24 Hindu participants who also played 9 other well-known climate games, such as <em>Beecarbonize</em>, <em>Terra Nil</em>, and <em>Mission 1.5</em>. The evaluation combined both quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess engagement, novelty, and cultural resonance.</p>

  <h3>Quantitative Instruments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>PENS:</strong> To assess player autonomy, competence, and relatedness</li>
    <li><strong>IMI:</strong> For intrinsic motivation and interest</li>
    <li><strong>GAMEFULQUEST:</strong> To assess novelty, attention demand, and usefulness</li>
    <li><strong>Situational Interest Scale:</strong> To measure exploration intent</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Statistical analysis using the Friedman test showed significant differences in player responses across games, with <strong>Shloka</strong> consistently outperforming others in key areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Novelty:</strong> p &lt; 0.001, F(9, 210) = 19.45</li>
    <li><strong>Exploration Intent:</strong> p &lt; 0.001, F(9, 210) = 23.7</li>
    <li><strong>Usefulness & Attention Demand:</strong> p &lt; 0.001</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Wilcoxon post-hoc tests confirmed that <strong>Shloka</strong> was significantly more novel and engaging than the other games in the corpus.</p>

  
  <p>Through our grounded theory analysis, we identified four major thematic categories that reveal how players reflected on rituals and their connection to climate change. Each theme emerged in two distinct ways depending on the player's level of religiosity and prior gaming experience.</p>

  <h4>1. Rituals as Mechanic vs. Rituals as Meaning</h4>
  <p>Some players treated rituals like mudras or chanting as input gestures—novel but mechanical. Others saw them as sacred acts that deepened their commitment to climate action. High-religiosity participants described feeling 'watched by god' or spiritually awakened while performing rituals in-game.</p>

  <h4>2. Gods as Guides vs. Gods as Gimmicks</h4>
  <p>While many players appreciated the deities as cultural guides who empowered them with climate solutions, a few non-religious players initially found them ornamental or performative. However, as the game progressed, even skeptics began to see the gods as metaphorical agents of ecological care.</p>

  <h4>3. Story as Reflection vs. Story as Motivation</h4>
  <p>For some, the narrative journey through temple towns mirrored their own experiences and prompted reflection. Others were less focused on meaning and more driven by the goal of "fixing the world." In both cases, the story supported either emotional connection or gameplay momentum.</p>

  <h4>4. Climate Change as Personal vs. Climate Change as Playable</h4>
  <p>Several participants shared that playing <em>Shloka</em> reframed climate change as something close to home and aligned with their values. Others enjoyed the game’s design without engaging deeply with the underlying issues—demonstrating the balance between reflection and entertainment.</p>

  <p>These thematic tensions illustrate that <strong>rituals in games can evoke both spiritual reflection and playful engagement</strong>, depending on the player’s background. This diversity in experience affirms the flexibility of ritual-based mechanics as a design approach.</p>
