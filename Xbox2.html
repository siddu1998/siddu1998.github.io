                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    
                    <div class="key-finding">

                        <p><strong>Business Challenge:</strong> Xbox Research historically focused on Seattle players, limiting global insights. Expanding internationally required language-fluent researchers and timezone-flexible studies—costly and slow.</p>
                        <p><strong>User Pain Point:</strong> Researchers spent weeks waiting for vendors to clean data, translate content, and coordinate international sessions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong> Without scalable solutions, Xbox risked missing player insights in growth markets, potentially losing millions in revenue.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Xbox Research as an organization conducts player research to understand player behavior, preferences, and experiences within games. However, Xbox historically has focused on understanding players within Seattle, USA. With Xbox aiming to expand its research efforts globally, it faces the challenge to conduct UX studies across languages and agnostic of timezones. In this case-study, we discuss AURA Toolkit - AI User Reserach Assistants Toolkit, an effort initiated, designed and developed by me to increase the adaption of AI within Xbox Research and improve scale, speed at which UX reserach is conducted across Xbox. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p><strong>As the sole Lead Researcher, Designer, and Developer</strong>, I initiated, conceptualized, designed, built, and evaluated the entire AURA Toolkit:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Conducted 8 contextual inquiries</strong> and 5 semi-structured interviews</li>
                        <li><strong>Synthesized pain points</strong> and user needs</li>
                        <li><strong>Designed 4 AI-powered tools</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Built full-stack applications</strong> integrating LLMs</li>
                        <li><strong>Evaluated with 35+ participants</strong> through mixed-methods analysis</li>
                        <li><strong>Presented to Xbox leadership</strong> and secured adoption</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h2>Impact of AURA Toolkit</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>100% researcher preference:</strong> All Participants found the AURA Interviews and AURA Surveys to be more efficient in providing playtest feedback compared to regular surveys and unmoderated Interviews.</li>
                        <li><strong>8 hours saved per study:</strong> AURA Canvas was effective in helping researchers visualize their data, arrange their data and identify themes from their data, <strong>resulting in saving an average of 8 hours time per reserach study/playtest</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>$400k+ estimated annual savings:</strong> AURA Toolkit helped reducing reliency on vendor support for data annotation, data collection, and subscription fees for tools like Dscout, UserTesting, and contract vendors<strong> saving around $400k annually.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Global research enabled:</strong> Language-agnostic and timezone-flexible studies across Xbox's expansion markets</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                

              

               

                <h2>Co-designing with Researchers</h2>
                <p>While AI offers a lot of promise, it is critical to understand how AI can best help UX Researchers in an organization from the researchers themselves. To understand the needs of researchers, I conducted 8 contextual inquiries and 5 semi-structured interviews with researchers across Xbox Research. Through these sessions, I identified key pain points and opportunities for AI integration in their workflows.</p> 

                <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time Between Raw Data and Oraganized Data: </strong>Researcers spend a significant amout of time waiting for vendors to clean-up data, arrange data and identify important recordings, clipping and snippets from interviews and suverys</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Scope of Data due to georgraphical and economical constraints: </strong> As Xbox expands to south-east asia and other markets, it becomes increasingly challenging to hire researcehrs fluent in specific languages and cultural contexts. Further, timezones make it challenging to conduct  interviews and playtests across timezones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Need for Real-time Collaboration: </strong> Researchers expressed a desire for tools that facilitate real-time collaboration and feedback, especially when working with remote teams across different time zones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Visualization and Synthesis: </strong> Researchers often struggle with synthesizing large amounts of qualitative data into actionable insights. They expressed a need for tools that can help visualize and organize data effectively.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>AURA Toolkit</h2>
                <p>Based on the insights gathered from researchers, I conceptualized and developed AURA Toolkit - AI User Research Assistants Toolkit, a suite of AI-powered tools designed to assist researchers in various stages of the research process. The toolkit includes the following main components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AURA Interviews:</strong> AI-assisted interviews that streamline the process of conducting and analyzing user interviews agnostic of timezone and language.</li>
                    <li><strong>AURA Surveys:</strong> Intelligent surveys that adapt questions based on user responses, improving data quality and relevance.</li>
                    <li><strong>AURA Canvas:</strong> A visual collaboration tool that helps researchers organize and synthesize data in real-time and uses LLMs to take a Human In the Loop approach towards running grounded theory based analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>AURA Coder:</strong> A qualitative analysis tool to help collaborative qualitative coding, allowing users to develop or recycle codebooks on their data. The tool leverages Copilot to help users in running qualitative analysis.</li>
                </ul>
