   <h3 style="color: black;"><b>Invento Robotics, Bangalore, India</b></h3>
   <h5>R&D Engineer | June 2020- March 2021; May 2018 - June 2018</h5>
   
   <ul>
    <li>Performed Qualitative Research with Stakeholders at various stages of Robot Deployment timeline to design Fleet Control Portals.</li>  
    <li>Developed Invento's Autonomus Navigation Stack. Currently the Navigation Stack established has covered over 10,000 Km at various customer locations across 5 continents.</li>
    <li>Developed a Fleet Management Portal to mine patterns in customer interaction with Robots. The portal also allows Humans to take control over the robot to support the growing requirement of Human-In-The-Loop. </li>
    <li>Developed an end-to-end EHR soltuion which is supported with Telemedicine capabilities. Unlike Exisiting Systmes the developed system supports various sensors like Stethoscope, Thermal Sensors, Weight scale and even a otoscope over Telemedicine. Check out the video below about my work being covered in CNN and patients interacting with developed software.</li>
   </ul>

    <h5>Research Scholar | January 2020 - June 2020</h5>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Worked with Professor Yogesh Simmhan at the DREAM Lab.</li>
        <li>Developed Image Masking Algorithms to protect privacy in images. But at the same time made sure objects in these images were detectable through re-trained object detection networks.</li>
        <li>Developed Centralized Contact Graphs for COVID-19 Contact Tracing and perform temporal analysis.</li>
    </ul>

   <h5>Research Scholar | June 2019 - August 2019</h5>
   
   <ul>
    <li>Performed Qualitative Research with Research stakeholders for designing tools for LiDAR data manipulation.</li>
    <li>Worked under Dr. Yi-Chang (James) Tsai, on developing computer vision algorithms and associating them with 3D LiDAR data to generate insigts on road assets. 
       Two very important and significant contributions done by me so far 
       in this lab include, the LiDAR retro-intensity mapper,
        and the distance estimation algorithm using 2D image and reconstructing pixel depth </li>
