      <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
      <p>You unlocked all the levels of our special story edition 1. I love you! You are the most amazing person I know, I sleep knowing I am loved, cared and taken care for. 
        Thank you for being patient with me, thank you for loving me the way you do. Your birthday is coming and I am super excited about it. From waking up with you, to sleeping with you, I love you utterly butterly much
         and that love is strong, steady, and unwavering. It’s not tied to perfect circumstances or a perfect journey—it’s about who you are and how you make me feel every single day. When I’m with you, I feel seen, understood, and cared for in ways that go beyond words. 
         You make me feel like I matter, like I’m special, and like I’ve found someone I can truly build something meaningful with. 
         love is not about pretending challenges don’t exist; it’s about choosing each other through those challenges, growing stronger, and deepening our bond.
          And that’s what I want with you, because what we have is so special and worth every bit of effort.
         I love you for who you are—the way you laugh, the way you make me feel safe, the way you bring so much light into my life. 
         You’ve made me feel things I thought I’d never feel again, and I don’t take that for granted. 
         You are my person, and nothing can change that.
