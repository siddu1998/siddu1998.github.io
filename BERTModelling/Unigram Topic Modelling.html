Specifically are there specific patrons for TV series, films, comic books, and video games as individual separate rulers for each of the aforementioned subjects?\n\nOr would you have to analyze and assign old gods?

I'm developing a Hindu inspired video game and would like to know your thoughtsI'm currently working on an FPS game where you play as a character with multiple arms and the inspiration came from depictions of many Hindu gods which possess that feature. From there, I was inspired to come up with a basic concept for the backstory of the game and I wanted to check in here before moving forward to make sure I am not being disrespectful.\n\n\nHere's the premise: We're in the far future and humanity has achieved immortality (through science, a pact with demons, or whatever), and Vishnu is PISSED. So you, the player character (Right now I'm leaning towards making the main character Kali) is sent to Earth to bring death back through incredible violence and style.\n\nNow, I came up with this based on very little research and understanding of actual Hinduism and I would like to know what your thoughts are. How would you suggest I tweak this? This is not a story-heavy game so I am open to changing anything.\n\nThank you!

The younger people often answered, that virtual creatures are just like a theater or puppet that cannot experience suffering, so there is no karmic consequence of killing virtual creatures in video games.\n\nBut some older people answered, that even if they cannot feel any suffering, the act of killing by the people who kill virtual creatures, creates bad karma, because they show no mercy and compassion.\n\nI also would guess, that we cannot know, of virtual creatures suffer or not. It could also be, that now that there are virtual existences, beings can be born as a creature in a video game and suffer a thousand times by getting killed by players over and over again.\n\nThere are also some differences to theater and films, because the actors just performing a story. In virtual worlds, people kill virtual creatures, to getting more powerful, or gain more reputation, gold or points, which is similar to greed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?", "want to know all about karma1.

My name is Tirtha. I joined the temple a year ago and my life has completely transformed. Before coming here I was a confused young boy, who had just finished school. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.). But by the mercy of my teachers, I was able to transform my life and become a better person. Although I have just started my path. I can confidently say that my life is meaningful and it has a deep purpose. I am happy, therefore I want to share this opportunity with others.\n\nBrahmacharya is a life of a monk, it's a commitment to restrict oneself from sense gratification, and focus on your spiritual growth. Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\n\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination\u2013all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don't develop the necessary skills.\n\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\n\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It's an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\n\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek. There is a beautiful lake right next to us and breathtaking waterfalls just a few minutes away. It is a peaceful, quiet, and relaxing environment that is perfect for our spiritual practice.\n\nThis is exactly what we are doing in our ashram (temple). We are training young men (from 18 years old) to become strong, responsible individuals in our society. We are studying Vedic scriptures, under the guidance of our teacher Rasik Mohan Prabhu who is a lifelong monk, and who lived in a monastery in India for 16 years of his life. Every day we are practicing yoga and meditation. We also have a lot of service (seva) to do. Our project started only a year and a half ago. We have a lot of things to do and we are also open to new possibilities.\n\nWe are also learning many different arts and skills such as yoga, meditation, visualization, construction, painting, building, gardening, book publication, writing, singing, artistic skills, memorizing verses, studying different scriptures, public speaking, and many other things.\n\nSo as a resident of the monastery I am inviting every young man who is interested to come and learn how to think like a monk, and most importantly how to live like a monk.\n\nIf you are interested or have any questions you can write here or contact me: brotherhoodofmonks@gmail.com\n\nNamaste,\n\nTirtha", "Bhagwan Shiva and Bhagwan Ganesha in game , your thoughts , video link in comments", "Gyaan Yoga - The Path of Knowledge**A Surprising Discovery**\n\nIt is surprising to me that there are not more posts here about Gyaan Yoga: The Path of Knowledge. The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \n\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn\u2019t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn\u2019t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \n\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\n\n**The Mountain**\n\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\n\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha's teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \n\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\n\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \n\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\n\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn't fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\n\n**On Clarity of Mind**\n\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don't fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn't produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\n\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner\u2019s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\n\n**On The Modern School System**\n\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier's posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \n\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people's minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \n\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\n\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \n\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\n\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\n\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \n\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\n\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \n\n> \"How do you know that?\"\n\n> \"Well, I don't. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \n\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don't know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \n\n**On Consciousness**\n\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder \u201cwhy do whirlpools have water flowing through them?\u201d\n\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\n\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind \u2018Chitti Vritti\u2019. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize \u2018Chitti Vritti\u2019 as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say \u201cthe sun is bigger than the moon\u201d. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say \u201cI don't know if the sun is bigger than the moon\u201d? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\n\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\n\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn't it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \n\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer's circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \n\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as \u201cPragyaanam Brahma\u201d. This means, \u201cAbsolute clarity is Brahman\u201d. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.", "Is there more pain in life than happinessSchopenhauer says that we have an infinite susceptibility to pain but finite susceptibility to pleasure. Do you agree with it or not? Are there arguments against this notion of his?\n\nIs there a limit to happiness where it peaks and then there nothing further? like a video game where you can't upgrade anymore cause you've maxed out, but pain, sadness is a bottomless abyss where it could always get worse. Do you agree with this notion? Could you argue against it?\n\n A lot of religions promise an afterlife filled with infinite pleasure and happiness as opposed to the condition on earth, do you think such a place exists? I think that because the neurons in our brains always requires new things to stimulate it, and they get \"used to\" the old things that once made you happy but now they don't give you any pleasure so if we live eternally, it is inevitable that **every single thing** around us loses its charm/value to our minds and stops being pleasurable.\n\n So does this mean that nothing in life matters?

To sum it up it's a long-running jrpg series that is usually set in an apocalyptic setting and revolves around ideological conflict, this includes:\n\n1. The law side which fights for order and archives to create a socialist utopia represented by the judeo-christian angels\n\n2. It's opposition, the Chaos faction that strives to create a dystopian anarchy so \"only the strong can survive\" and limitless freedom can be accomplished that is represented by the judeo-christian fallen angels/demons\n\n3. and the neutral side which denounces both so humanity can follow the best of both sides, which results in it being unstable and suseptable to more ideological wars, and is represented by humans and sometimes even random pagan gods and goddesses.\n\nNow, some of you may be familiar to [this little controversy](https://nichegamer.com/2016/02/03/hindus-are-pissed-that-krishna-is-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final/) that happened over a year ago (i'm not sure how repeatable the source is, so take it with a grain of salt), which actually inspired me to write this post so i can present what krishna is in-game to those not familiar with it. To begin, i'll just say he's more than just a summonable ally, he plays a major role in the story actually.\n\nnow that i've quickly boiled down the basics of the series, maybe you are wondering what that role in the latest game is. Well, i can't really do this without spoiling the game's plot, but here i go: after he is unsealed he preaches about how yahweh trapped souls into the material realm so they are forced to cling to him via the circle of law-chaos (i could go more into detail, but that'd make this post a lot longer than it already is). Krishna's plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn't exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it's left up to interpretation i suppose)\n\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you're a big fan of the guy. But no such luck with Krishna, he's simply a forced antagonist who you can't side with.\n\nand the last thing i will talk about, the character design: now, [his regular form](https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/8/8d/SMT_IV_FINAL_Krishna.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025173647) is a pretty good design personally, and along with being very expressive it does a good job conveying his charming, calm but also snarky and sometimes sarcastic. i'm not sure whether i'd say \"that's Krishna\" the first time i saw his design, but he definitely feels like krishna when i look at him (at least to me)\n\nBut his [vishnu](https://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_B_SMT4A.jpg) [designs](https://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_II_SMTIVA_Official_Art.jpg) seem to go more with the forced antagonist role he plays in the story; maybe the design is referencing something i don't know, but with the \"nandakas\" in the second form that really look more like lightsabers, i can't help but to look at vishnu and think \"what is he, a sith lord?\" Kinda discredits him as a god of preservation when his design seems to just say *evil*\n\nSo that about wraps it up, but as a note i should say that my goal is not to upset or get anyone offended with this post. i'm just curious to see what this community thinks of Krishna's whole portrayal in this game. is it faithful to his origins or not? is this offensive or are these just silly video games that shouldn't be taken seriously? Are the designs any good or do they just discredit him as a deity?

L. Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \n\n\n\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it's a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \n\n\n\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\n\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \n\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \n\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \n\n\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \n\n\n**Eastern Responses** \n\n\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \n\n\n\n**1. Karma**\n\n\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \n\n\n\n\n\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\n\n\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God's vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \n\n\n\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \n\n\n\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \n\n\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\n\n\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie's Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \n\n\n\n---\n\n\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \n\n\n\n\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP", "I have a question for using Hinduism in my fictional storyHi, I'm an early game dev in the beginning stages of creating a fighting game video game  and I want to add a Hindu character to my roster.

This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\n\nI\u2019ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the \u2018perceiver\u2019 of this world and everything else is just something you \u2018perceive\u2019?\n\nYour *\u2018self\u2019* is that which you call as *\u2018I\u2019*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\n\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\n\nBut you, that is your *\u2018self\u2019*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *\u2018self\u2019* is the **only** thing that\u2019s *real*.\n\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *\u2018self\u2019* is the only thing that\u2019s knowable or real.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don\u2019t you have the freedom to do anything since *\u2018you\u2019* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\n\nBut there\u2019s a resolution to that. It\u2019s nothing new. It\u2019s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\n\nIt\u2019s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the \u2018self\u2019 that is you, is the same as the \u2018self\u2019 of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\n\n*\u2018That\u2019* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as \u2018Brahman\u2019 in Advaita philosophy. *\u2018That\u2019* is also your *\u2018self\u2019* and everyone else\u2019s *\u2018self\u2019* and all of creation\u2019s *\u2018self\u2019*. Which is why Hindus say \u2018god\u2019 is everywhere.\n\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as \u2018God\u2019, \u2018Allah\u2019 etc. is just a partial representation of \u2018that\u2019.\n\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you\u2019ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~\u2018you\u2019 stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\n", "Jcink Roleplay - Hinduism ElementsIf you don't know - a roleplay on a message board (like Jcink or Proboards) is essentially writing parts of a story with friends online (you write part of it, then a friend will respond and write the next part, and it goes from there, piece by piece). \n\nPantheons (Greek/Roman, Norse, just to name a few) are a fun subject to explore with this type of collaborative writing setting.\n\n**I had a friend that wanted to make a roleplay but involve the Hindu pantheon in some shape or form (modern day gods on earth, children of the gods, mortals blessed with the god's powers through blessed items, etc.). Besides doing the proper research on who the deities are and the like - what would be the \"safest\" setting for this type of plot that involved the pantheon?** \n\nI've seen people who practice Hinduism be sensitive to the idea of people portraying their pantheon in any kind of written media or say video game media and she wants to make sure she isn't accidentally stepping on the wrong toes with this.\n\nShe practices Hinduism herself (not since birth, she stepped away from another religion and has seen herself as a Hindu for only about 2-3 years at this point) so she knows the \"core beliefs\" of Hinduism and the like (but again, this story/plotline would revolve around the Hindu gods). Her train of thought is \"If all these different pantheon have so much attention like Egypt and Norse, why can't Hindu pantheon get some attention/love\"? (Which I don't blame her, I would LOVE for more POSITIVE/good attention involving the Hindu pantheon myself that's not horribly written and wildly offensive).", "Shiva enters the world", "Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism# Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism\n\nsource: paraphrased from several talks by Swami Paramarthananda.\n\nThere is a lot of confusion around the necessity and role of Vedas and guru in Hinduism.  These are some common questions that people have.\n\n1. Why do I need to study the Vedas?\n2. Is a guru really necessary?\n3. Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\n5. How do I choose a guru?\n\n## Necessity of Vedas\n\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\n\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\n\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\n\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\n\nLet's briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\n\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\n\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\n\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\n\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\n\n## Necessity of a Guru\n\nWhy can't I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn't make much sense at first glance.\n\n>yasy\u0101mata\u1e43 tasya mata\u1e43 mata\u1e43 yasya na veda sa\u1e25 |  \n>  \n>avij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e43 vij\u0101nat\u0101\u1e43 vij\u00f1\u0101tamavij\u0101nat\u0101m || 11 ||  \n>  \n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\n\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\n\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\n\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\n\n>par\u012bk\u1e63ya lok\u0101nkarmacit\u0101nbr\u0101hma\u1e47o nirvedam\u0101y\u0101nn\u0101styak\u1e5bta\u1e25 k\u1e5btena |  \n>  \n>tadvij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e43 sa gurumev\u0101bhigacchetsamitp\u0101\u1e47i\u1e25 \u015brotriya\u1e43 brahmani\u1e63\u1e6dham || 12 ||  \n>  \n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, \u2018there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\n\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\n\n>tasya yath\u0101bhinahana\u1e43 pramucya prabr\u016by\u0101det\u0101\u1e43 di\u015ba\u1e43 gandh\u0101r\u0101 et\u0101\u1e43 di\u015ba\u1e43 vrajeti sa gr\u0101m\u0101dgr\u0101ma\u1e43 p\u1e5bcchanpa\u1e47\u1e0dito medh\u0101v\u012b gandh\u0101r\u0101nevopasampadyetaivameveh\u0101c\u0101ryav\u0101npuru\u1e63o veda tasya t\u0101vadeva cira\u1e43 y\u0101vanna vimok\u1e63ye'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \n>  \n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person\u2019s blindfold and say, \u2018Gandh\u0101ra is this way; go this way,\u2019 and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandh\u0101ra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\n\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\n\n>tadviddhi pra\u1e47ip\u0101t\u0113na paripra\u015bn\u0113na s\u0113vay\u0101 |  \n>  \n>upad\u0113k\u1e63yanti t\u0113 j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101ninastattvadar\u015bina\u1e25 || 4.34||  \n>  \n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\n\n## Who is a guru?\n\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\n\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\n\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\n\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\n\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\n\n1. **Shravanam** \\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\n2. **Mananam** \\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\n\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\n\n>\u0101tm\u0101 v\u0101 are dra\u1e63\u1e6davya\u1e25 \u015brotavyo mantavyo nididhy\u0101sitavyo maitreyi, \u0101tmano v\u0101 are dar\u015banena \u015brava\u1e47ena maty\u0101 vij\u00f1\u0101neneda\u1e43 sarva\u1e43 viditam || 5 ||  \n>  \n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitrey\u012b, should be realised\u2014should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\n\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\n\n## How do I find a guru?\n\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara's grace is necessary.\n\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\n\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\n\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara's job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\n\nThank you for reading.", "Ancient board games of India.There are some games you play and then there are some classic games your parents played.\nHave you wondered how you parents spent their time during the holidays without the digital games that we have these days in abundance?\nWell they played outside for one and then they had a lot of board games at their disposal.\nBelieve you me that these games were played not just by our parents but even by their parents and before! \nIn this video, I mention some great ancient board games that our ancestors played as kids.\nDo check out the video and see if you have ever played these games. \nAlso suggest more games that you played and that I didn't cover in the video.\nEnjoy the video and make sure to show it to your kids as well! \ud83d\ude01\ud83e\udd17\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udfb2\ud83c\udfb2\ud83d\udc1a\ud83d\udc1a \n\n#ancientboardgames #boardgamesarefun #boardgames #boardgamesaddict #indiangames #indianboardgames \n\n3+1 Ancient Indian board games that your ancestors played as kids https://youtu.be/EB6GbfsJk88", "A narrow minded question about hinduism!

The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the \u201cBrahmavarta\u201d or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \n\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\n\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\n\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\n\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\n\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru\u2019s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha. So end of Mahabharata brings about a change not just in the rulers of Hatinapur but gave a new direction to the entire the then future of India wherein not just a new power  arose to rule but also a different philosophy which was Non-Vedic in nature gained prominence. More details in the video below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnwSUVFseCQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnwSUVFseCQ)", "What is everyone's opinion of the MOBA Smite's depiction of the DevasBefore we go further I am aware that some people find it highly offensive that the devas are in this game saying they are meant to be worshiped not controlled to fight. I understand that I'm not saying its not a valid stance. However Smite is what sparked the fire with my conversion to Hinduism. Reading the spark note esk back story on the devas made we want to look up and learn more about them and what they represent. I was an athiest for several and had tried other religions and philosophies before as I've stated before , without feeling the tiniest sliver of anything. Then after reading the Mahabharata and the Ramayana I prayed for a sign that this was the proper path for me and was answered! And now I'm way happier than I ever was with anything else and I owe it all to Smite getting that going.

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\n\nLast year\u2019s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\n\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\n\n\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco\u2019s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina\u2019s QB Cam Newton but Payton\u2019s little brother [Eli Manning\u2019s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \n\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \n\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\n\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\n\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\n\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \n\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*", "\"you are the universe experiencing itself\"", "Hello all, just an environment update of our Upcoming Game Project - Devraja!

Well, not everyone hated online classes, being able to play games during the class and cheat on exams quite easily! But now the COVID-19 pandemic is slowly coming to an end. Yes ... sloowwly! And that does not mean you won't wear masks! Please do wear your masks and keep yourselves safe. This will accelerate the slow process of the ending of the pandemic. \nThe main aim in life is to achieve peace. This peace needs to be reached in slow and cautious steps. To achieve spiritual happiness means to achieve peace. Material happiness is not our goal. Yet, eternal peace remains as a result of our work, but it is never to be thought of as a goal. Do not pressurise yourself, thinking, \"I NEED TO ACHIEVE ETERNAL PEACE!\" no, no! Peace cannot be achieved in such a manner. Do your work without expecting results, good or bad. When the results come, accept them without hesitation. Enjoy the results, if good, suffer the results, if bad, but do not get attached to them. Karma Yoga and Upasana Yoga are the works you need to do to achieve Jnana Yoga, which purify your mind and make it ready for what is to come, and Jnana Yoga means knowledge. This knowledge grants you peace. \nI have seen many places in India. Everywhere, I have seen people who throw plastic, wastes and whatever garbage they carry with themselves on the roads, and even the beautiful waterfalls and rivers. The banks of the rivers are full of plastic and wastes. Please be cautious as to not litter our beautiful vast land of Gods.\nAll that I have said is a result of my experience up until now.

Existence is a phenomenon beyond utility. \ue004e mind thinks of utility only because it is a scavenger in perennial hunter-gatherer mode. Human individuality has been gathered. But with enlightenment, there is nothing to gather or to give, nothing to take or to return, nothing to accumulate or to surrender.

His book mainly deals with how one can apply the concepts of law and order in daily life, personal, social and universal levels. However, the book, as is evident from its inconsistent manuscripts all over India, is not entirely the work of a single self assumed \u201cManu\u201d, but rather a collective work of creative and stubborn fascists who had but a very strong vision on rule-making and science of administration.\n\nBefore we spit out to the Manu and the Brahmins, we must also note that Manu could not have been a single author, and he could not have been a fully racist casteist. Though Manu does appear racist fascist in designating non Aryans outside Aryavarta as barbarians, and casteist through his statements, it is to be noted that only less than 60% of the book is really authentic. And within that, there are internally inconsistent verses. So, in whole, even to this day, one can follow the Manu smrti that suits him, from the collection of verses we have today.\n\nSo what does it speak about?\n\nContrary to the popular belief, Manu smrti is not about imposing rule in lower castes, but it is a text that really traps Brahmins (which eventually forced Brahmins to manipulate it by adding escape clauses), and makes him not more than a robot, without self opinion or thought or choice of action. Having killed his opportunities and pleasures, the Manu \u201cgenersously\u201d gives Brahmin a position highest in the society. (And does not forget to mention that Brahmins should always follow those restrictions) But yea, our later Manus who tampered with the text created verses that finally created an arrogant Brahmin caste in top with immense positions, who could not be questioned, but could dictate anything.\n\nManu discusses in detail about the different \u201cVarnashramas\u201d of different castes. The Brahmin\u2019s part is naturally the largest, consisting of restrictions for every breath and movement. Almost four whole chapters are dedicated to restricting, controlling and immobilizing the Brahmin. Manu makes many clauses, some of them directly contradicting, but in the core, Manu wants Brahmin to be simply spiritual, above worldly pleasures, and highly orthodox. Manu, apart from prohibiting meat for Brahmins (somewhere else he also comments that one may eat meat \u201cincidentally\u201d as a leftover of a legitimate animal sacrifice), also prohibits a wide range of foods right from onion, garlic, mushroom\u2026 Brahmin is also prohibited to do any jobs other than his Veda teaching, learning, gifting, receiving business. And Manu also considers the following to be highly shameful jobs to a Brahmin (apart from the other \u201cprohibited\u201d jobs of other castes) : astrology, music, dance, doctor\u2026 Even Brahmin\u2019s dress code is highly limited - he cannot wear beard if without proportionate hair locks, and even in such cases, the Brahmin with hair locks is not called to many functions like death anniversary feasts. His normal clothing, normal appearance, the attitude everything is predefined. Everything right from breathing (not joking), even eating posture (again, not a joke), walking, doing jobs, when to teach, when to learn, what to not do, how to not live your life, what not to eat, what not to think, what not to wear, where not to live, who should not invited for your parties and feasts, what not to desire, whom to marry, whom not to\u2026\u2026\n\nNow comes the part of Kshatriya, the king. The Manu unlike the prohibition he made for all Brahmins from worldly pleasures, allows those \u201cpleasures\u201d to the king, but without addiction. However, Manu does create limits to the king and asks him to stay away from certain vices. The king\u2019s laws are there in two chapters, but detailed so as to aid his rule. Personal rules are lesser. The rules of administration are well designed, though our later Manus have had a part in interpolating some \u201cgenerous\u201d verses into them.\n\nThe Vaishya and Shudras have rules separate, only in a single chapter, about 8 rules for Vaishyas and 2 for Shudras. Almost no personal restrictions as a part of their code, but their status much depends on the presence of other castes, the other caste determines the status of how one caste tends to behave.\n\nApart from all these personal restrictions to Brahmins in four long chapters (Kshatriyas have only two chaps for them, even when talking about ruling guidelines in detail), Manu supported Brahmins and Brahmanism. Manu does hint about Shramanas, and looks down upon them. The later Manus, through addition of thoughtful verses, made a Brahmin unquestionable. And, it would be silly to blame the initial Manu for all that.\n\nApart from the usual laws, Manu also anticipates laws during emergency periods. Here, a convenient relaxation is given in laws.\n\nIt is probable that initial Manu envisioned a well divided caste society with more pressure on Brahmins, who but recieved great respect, lesser pressure on King, who deserved respect from all, and almost no pressure on Shudras or Vaishyas. Castes below that have no personal restrictions - they can live their life without \u201coffending\u201d the other castes.\n\nAltogether, the Manu Smrti is a well planned, but corrupted text, just like any text post vedic age there are power games which are noticable, we know these inconsistencies come when any 'religion' in power, we know this because we can observe this with Bhuddism and jainism scriptures as well, the moment they become the dominant religion of a region/s they start downplaying the 'ahimsa' principal, we know that no matter the religion the priests which were patronised indulged in religious propaganda on the king's behalf when their king and his ambition in regards to war and conquest grew and then they justified their 'dharmic' war and their practices some of which are abbhorent, this was a practice done by every major religion in india when they were in the dominant position, this point is expanded upon in Upinder Singh's book \"political violence in ancient india\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point through all this is that given that we know there was power politics and propaganda in these smrities/shastras etc how much weightage do you place on these scriptures, they are not shruties which are the axiomatic texts of hinduism, you don't buy into vedas and hinduism falls appart, that is not the case with smrities, so how much weight do you place on dhramshastras/smriti texts?? should they be read with 'shraddha' and be above criticisms like vedas like manusmrities suggests or should they be subjected to scrutiniy and not be above criticisms??", "Is it wrong in knowing who is Almighty about the Gods? Is there a standard given across Hindu tests to show that? How does one know who?This is not to cause division among Hindus so please read till the end.   \n**Who is the almighty Vishnu or Shiva or Devi?** One has to understand the difference between portraying something as Almighty vs Discriminating against others. **Why not?** Such a description of \"Almighty\" can only be almighty because of the existence of other Non-Almighty entities to prove that.  **Why?** It's like a movie where a Hero can only be a Hero because of the villain. The worse the Villain, the better the hero. This is the approach taken by many sects, **but does it mean the sects are wrong?** **No, I am not saying the Vaishnava sect or the Shaiva sect etc... are wrong,** but it's not how many are portraying it to be. See, all it takes to destroy such an approach is just to prove that hero cannot be a hero without a villain. Or a king is only a king because of the people in the kingdom. If the kingdom is empty then **he is the king of what?** Another question can be asked. If the same almighty God created these non-almighty demigods, then why is the religion not written like the western religions where there is absolutely no doubt who is who and who is not? Why Vedas? Why Darshanas? Why Tantras? Why Itihasas? Any are these non-almighty gods outside the one Almighty God? Or are they within/part of the one Almighty God? If they are part of the Almighty god then that means this almighty god has parts that are non-almighty. It's like saying my body has some cells that are of lesser and insignificant quality, in scientific terms, it's called Cancer. So what are these sects?\n\nFor example, Srimad Bhagavatam is one of the pinnacle of Bhakti Puranic literature dedicated to Sri Krishna for Vaishnava. But in that, there is a chapter dedicated to Shiva in which he is addressed as Brahman. In the same Purana, Sri Vishnu calls Trimurti are essentially the same. So there was no need for a Vaishnava literature to say that. Even Prabhupad said that \"Sri Vishnu and SadaShiva are the same\" but only in one instance, but I will not go deep into them.\n\nNow take Devi Bhagavatam: Though it's a pinnacle for Bhuvaneshwari, the highest order of sustenance is given to Sri Maha Vishnu than Shiva. They didn't have to do that.\n\nNow go back to Itihasas: Both Shankara and Krishna are called Rudras. And Narayana says I am in the heart of Rudra and Rudra is my heart and those who make distinctions are fools.\n\nNow go back to great saints: TulasiDas who is a staunch devotee of Rama wrote Rama Charitramanas first gave salutations to Vani and Ganesha and also composed Rudrastakam (inhered from \u1e5a\u1e63i Lomasa), why?   \nBhartruhari a staunch devotee of Shiva said \"I do not see any fundamental difference between Shiva the Overlord of the universe, or Vishnu the Inner Soul of the universe. But still, my affection is for the one who has a crescent moon on his head\"\n\nVedic Rishis didn't fight with each other in the Vedas claiming Vishnu is supreme to Shiva or Indra. Kenopnishad says \"Indra then recognized that Uma the daughter of the mountains is that Brahman\". Each sect was designed to emulate the Iconified version of Supremacy as the highest Pinnacle or as the whole. It's done so for the purpose of S\u0101dhan\u0101 (a focused approach to rising in consciousness, without distractions of other schools).  Only a few ignoramuses for whom devotions have not reached their hearts but reached their ego center play the supremacy games. Rest are engrossed in S\u0101dhan\u0101. Yet if you honestly want to get supremacy it's better to join the Vishnava Group.", "A new book on Amazon talks about Indian philosophy...[https://www.amazon.com/Bougainvia-unified-India-Samprateek-Sinha-ebook/dp/B0BH851C1G/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?crid=37SCCFDTVCDT1&keywords=samprateek+sinha&qid=1665952184&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjkzIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=sampr%2Caps%2C1578&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Bougainvia-unified-India-Samprateek-Sinha-ebook/dp/B0BH851C1G/ref=sr_1_1?crid=37SCCFDTVCDT1&keywords=samprateek+sinha&qid=1665952184&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjkzIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=sampr%2Caps%2C1578&sr=8-1)", "ONA - Mystical Art Experience.

I\u2019ve just spent a lot of time researching the community and things relating to it for purposes of creating the document I am working on because anecdotal evidence from ex shifters and my research has pointed towards the shifting mindset being harmful to one\u2019s mental state, specifically regarding dissociation and related issues.\n\nI\u2019m working on a research document and a specific part of it needed a viewpoint I could not provide, as I do not practice Hinduism- if reality shifting was actually a Hindu practice. I made a post identical to this one on the r/Buddhism subreddit as well, since it is also used to support the shifting belief system.\n\nFor those unaware, Reality Shifting (also called Shifting, quantum jumping, moving realities, etc.) is a HUGE community built around the idea that by using certain \u2018methods\u2019 you can move your subconscious to another reality and live out a totally new life, or that you can become aware of your already existing consciousness in another reality. Stereotypically it\u2019s used by kids and teenagers to shift to Harry Potter and date the characters (specifically Draco) but it goes deeper than that, and many people use shifting as a way to live multiple lives with all of their favorite characters in their favorite shows/movies/anime/games/etc. Shifters tend to talk about \u2018the multiverse theory\u2019 (usually broadly or using the Many Worlds Interpretation) and use that to prove that shifting and all of these fictional worlds are real and that when they use their methods, they actually go there/become aware of their subconscious there.\n\nShifters tend to cite Hinduism and \u2018ancient Hindu practices\u2019 (with no elaboration) as proof that shifting is real and not just something that rose to popularity during the 2020 lockdowns on tiktok. However, I\u2019ve yet to find any connection between shifting and Hinduism, so I thought I\u2019d ask here. Is reality shifting or something similar part of Hinduism?

I heard seen their preachers insulting many gods as demigods and way below the god in which they have faith, even they insult devotees of others' beliefs harshly calling the term 'Mayavadi':** One has to read and explore the Veda composed by over 300 Vedic Rishis. None of them played this hasty game. None of the Rishis said, my homage or Vedic Suktam is better than your Suktam. Or my Vedic Divinity is better than yours. Many CULT preachers operate on Headcount, meaning, they are good at marketing, and their headcount determines the validity of their faith and teachings. As the saying goes **\"Believers go in groups, seekers go alone\"**. The three biggest things that anyone can do to destroy the Sanatana Culture are: 1. by distorting the credibility of the Guru and the magnificent beings born in this culture. 2. alter the Sanskrit text to one\u2019s own desire. 3. create a hierarchy of Divinity and downplay them by calling them cheap names/designations.\n\n**What is an Authorized Sampradaya?** The fact is there were over 1008 Vedic \u015a\u0101kh\u0101s whose lineage goes back to the Vedic Rishis and Brahmanas. Today only 14 \u015a\u0101kh\u0101s exist and only 6 of these families still continue this tradition. **They are called Authentic.** **Got it!!!** Now there is the Agamic tradition that comes from Tantra. Today both Agama and Nigama are mixed like water and concrete. Only hand full of these agamic schools exists and are very secluded and hidden from popularity. Go and sit with these 6 \u015a\u0101kh\u0101s, spend time with them, serve them, and learn from them. Learn grammar (Vyakaranam) and get initiated. Chant and learn for 14 years. Then tell us what abides with the Vedas and what is not. People reading printed books and translations and coming to social media and throwing up their textbook knowledge, writing articles with their 2cent analysis is not worth the paper, nor the battery power of their phones/tablets and computers.\n\n**Does Smartha say all divinities are the same?** No, the Vedas themselves don\u2019t say that, if so there was no need for so many divinities. Vedas explain various concepts of Rta, one cannot create a competition between them by putting them in a ring match and seeing who has more power and who wins. That only happens in Comic books and movies. Smartha operates on giving equal importance to all when homage is given but mandates one\u2019s own kula-divam (Divinity/Rishi lineage of the family and ancestors) to be given the final importance.

People come from all walks of life and from all kinds of circumstances, and approaching Hinduism purely from a spiritual standpoint is perfectly okay as a starting point. \n\nHowever, this stage gradually matures into the realisation that spirituality and religion are not enemies, and in fact, go hand in hand. \n\nImagine a building. The interiors of the building, all its various floors, right from the ground apartments to the terrace, correspond to sprituality. However, the interiors are supported by the external framework of the building, the most important part being the underground pillars and networks supporting the entire outer structure.\n\nThe underground pillars are the Vedas. The outer structure is itihasa and puranas. And the internal apartments in the building is sprituality, the essential teachings of religion. \n\nIt is impossible to ultimately be spiritual without being religious. You can have a building without apartments inside, but you can't have apartments inside without a building outside. Similarly, you can be religious without understanding its deeper teachings of spirituality, but you cannot be spiritual without being religious.\n\nMy basic point is this, spirituality is the epitome of religion, is the ultimate truth that religion is designed to impart to you. You cannot jump ahead directly to the truths of life without undergoing the necessary stages of development. The stages being the understanding of the scriptures, devotion for all forms of God, service to others. I've seen many people, especially in the philosophy I myself follow, that of advaita vedanta, claiming that they don't believe in God and that they are not religious. Hinduism doesn't need atheists in disguise.\n\nJust yesterday I saw a post on some spiritual subreddit which said 'I have opened my third eye, ask me anything.' I mean, are you serious? Have we reduced the chakras and other divine and extremely deep aspects of spirituality into some sort of game and a way of seeking validation and moral superiority and promoting pseudoscience?\n\nI have got into altercations with the orthodox religious people here too in the past who consider the words of the scriptures as words of God because of philosophical differences, but at least they were genuine to their philosophy and practice and were not hypocrites unlike the 'Spiritual but not religious people'. They simply see religion in a bad light and are too afraid to admit it.\n\nAgain, if you find yourself falling into this category, don't take this as an attack on you, but rather as an invitation to study religion deeply and with an open mind. If spirituality was simple and could be accessed directly, there would've been no need for religion in the first place.\n\n Orthodox religious systems are important and necessary, and while remaining stuck there and being attached to it due to identity politics is harmful, it is a necessary starting point. You need to walk into the building through the entrance, and can only then take the elevator to the topmost floor. You can't directly land on the terrace, it's called wishful thinking and lying to yourself. I'm talking to you, Advaita Vedanta. And yeah, I'm saying this as an Advaitin myself. Advaita is contaminated with these covert atheists.", "After working for months, finally published my first game. Mandir Nirmaan - Endless Temple Stack. Link in comments.

Everything we do is counted in this world and karma is maintained for everyone (similar to reddit). Finally, as one's time is up we get old and dying. Only to be reborn again as we still have desires. The universe where we will be reborn will depend solely on our desires that need to be fulfilled. We have been doing for million lifetimes already.\n\nThis also means there are infinite universes available to be accessed purely by our mind. There's a universe of Gods somewhere where water can be sprouted at their will. However, this requires immense levelup or good karma to reach these higher states of existence. Similarly, there's also a universe of demons where pain and torture are entertainment. Blood is a great drink for rejuvenation.

I felt like this life was only a game, after all I am this immortal consciousness which will never cease to exist.

And there Karna put up with Drona, for the purpose of learning arms.And that powerful youth contracted a friendship with Duryodhana. And having acquired all the four kinds of weapons from Drona, Kripa, and Rama, he became famous in the world as a mighty bowman. And after having contracted a friendship with Dhritarashtra's son, he became intent on injuring the sons of Pritha\" - Mahabharata Adi Parva CCCVII. \n\nTruth - Then when was he rejected by Drona? \n\n\"Karna. one day approached Drona in private and said these words unto him, 'I desire to be acquainted with the\u00a0Brahma\u00a0weapon, with all its\u00a0mantras\u00a0and the power of withdrawing it, for I desire to fight Arjuna......Thus addressed by him, Drona, from partiality for Phalguna, as also from his knowledge of the wickedness of Karna, said, 'None but a Brahmana, who has duly observed all vows, should be acquainted with the\u00a0Brahma\u00a0weapon, or a Kshatriya that has practised austere penances, and no other.'\" - Mahabharata Santi Parva Section II\n\nSo he was rejected when he asked for Brahmastra. And the reason is clear - he asked it in order to fight Arjuna. He is jealous and also Drona was partial to Arjuna (and his son) so he rejects. It is then that he goes to Parasurama and lies that he is Brahmin, possibly also because Drona said only Brahmin and Kshatriya that have observed all vows can learn. We must remember that it is only Arjuna that reached the highest extent, hence proving that austerity, humbleness, service to preceptor are most important qualities to obtain higher knowledge. \n\n(2) Karna met Duryodhana for the first time in Rangbhoomi - The above passage answers this. He knew Duryodhana from Gurukul days itself. Moreover he was involved in the poisoning of Bhima. His enmity with Pandavas started from Gurukul days not from Rangbhoomi. \n\n(3) Karna tried to prevent Cheerharan - No, he was the one who started it. \n\n\"And at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by anger, waving his well-shaped arms, said these words,--'O Vikarna, many opposite and inconsistent conditions are noticeable in this assembly... Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the attire of Draupadi.\" - Mahabharata Adi Parva Section LXVII\n\n(4) Karna was rejected by Draupadi in Swayamvar - Actually only few editions, like 4 out of 1000, mention this. It's an interpolation. Even the editions that mention that he was rejected, later when Dhrishtadyumna is wondering who can win the contest now that powerful kings have failed thinks \"Shalya and Karna both failed how can anyone else win?\", Clearly showing inconsistency. \n\nThe BORI critical edition , made after researching different versions, omits the part where she rejects him. Even Sri Madhvacharya boldly declared in 13th century itself that Mahabharata is interpolated heavily and then wrote Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya. Here he too writes that Karna missed the target and later Arjuna wins it - no mention of rejection of Karna by anyone. So on strength of Acharya's words and also research we know it's a later insertion. \n\n(5) Draupadi insulted Duryodhana as blind son of blind man - this is not in any edition. This is just from BR Chopra serial. \n\nThe Sanskrit version doesn't really mention her specifically. Neither does Bhagavatam, it just says the ladies laughed. Andhra Mahabharatam and some other versions says the Pandavas laughed and then Draupadi and other ladies also laughed. But it's just laughing which was quite natural, seeing everyone was doing that and it was indeed funny. It wasn't mean-spirited, Duryodhana was too proud and hence he took it in wrong light. \n\nSerial wanted to spice up matters by adding a dialogue like that, but it maligned her character as a haughty woman. \n\n(6) Draupadi was a haughty woman - She is the one who forgives the killer of her sons Aswatthama and asks Pandavas to spare him, so no way. There is no instance where she is proud at all. \n\n(7) Ghatotkacha was a noble and virtuous person - This is because of folk tales. Indeed he did help out the Pandavas and Draupadi during their exile, and he served his father and stepmother well. \n\nYes Bhagavan Krishna was the only one cheerful when he died and also one reason was so that Arjuna is saved from Karna's Vasava Shakti. But the other reason He mentions,\n\n\"If Karna had not slain him with his dart in great battle, I myself would have had to slay Bhima's son Ghatotkacha. From desire of benefiting you, I did not slay him before. That Rakshasa was inimical to Brahmanas and sacrifices. Because he was a destroyer of sacrifices and of a sinful soul, therefore hath he been thus slain. O sinless one, by that act as a means, the dart given by Sakra, hath also been rendered futile. O son of Pandu, they that are destroyers of righteousness are all slayable by me. Even that is the vow made by me, for establishing righteousness. Whither the\u00a0Vedas\u00a0and truth and self-restraint and purity and righteousness and modesty and prosperity and wisdom and forgiveness are always to be met with, thither I myself always remain.\" - Mahabharata Drona Parva Section CLXXXI\n\n(8) Krishna is just a man in Mahabharata except for Gita, Bhagavatam made Him a God. \n\nThis is the most laughable myth. Because every stanza of Mahabharata describes Him as God! I'll just give one but literally there are innumerous references. In Ramayana itself there are so many references to Sri Rama's divinity but in Mahabharata there are many many more. \n\nTwo main ones. Bhishma declares this in entire Sabha of all the kings of India and front of Devas also during Rajasuya Yajna. And Markandeya Rishi who personally met Bhagavan Narayana tells Yuddhishtira about Narayana and at the end says \"The Krishna you have with you now is that same Narayana \" and instructs him to worship Him. \n\nEven Duryodhana knew. Dhritarashtra is told this and that no one can win over Krishna. So he gets fearful and tells Duryodhana to stop fighting but Duryodhana says that he knows all this and that he can't win but that still he needs to, he can't stop himself, the anger against Pandavas is too great. Then Dhritarashtra curses his fate. \n\nThese are it for now! Doubts about any other incidents? Let me know! \n\nAdditional -\n\n(1)  Pandavas went to hell and Duryodhana went to heaven - that is just a vision. Why would Pandavas, the close friends of Krishna, go to hell? Krishna, who is declared as \"krishnam dharmam sanatanam\"? \n\nThe various abodes they reached are described in Mahabharata. Arjuna reaches Vaikuntha and is shown to be sporting with Krishna there. So no Pandavas did not go to hell. The Swarga Duryodhana went to is temporary as the Gita declares, it's not a permanent abode of bliss like Vaikuntha. \n\n(2) Shakuni was motivated by revenge - Interesting tale but no factual basis. It is not mentioned in Mahabharata, \n\n\"the chaste Gandhari hearing that Dhritarashtra was blind and that her parents had consented to marry her to him, from love and respect for her future husband, blindfolded her own eyes.\n\nSakuni, the son of Suvala, bringing unto the Kurus his sister endued with youth and beauty, formally gave her away unto Dhritarashtra. And Gandhari was received with great respect and the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp under Bhishma's directions. And the heroic Sakuni, after having bestowed his sister along with many valuable robes, and having received Bhishma's adorations, returned to his own city.\"\n\n- Mahabharata Adi Parva Section CX. \n\nShakuni's brothers are killed in Kurukshetra by the Pandavas, so no way they all died in a dungeon. He just loved his nephew and hence supported him. \n\n(3) Shakuni was a master strategist and rivalled only by Krishna, he planned everything - I don't recall any instance where he really did that much. I can only remember him driving the game of dice forward but otherwise it was mostly Karna and Duryodhana taking decisions. Shakuni seems to be the most moral out of the \"evil 4\" in fact. \n\nNeither does he seem like a master genius anywhere, he was definitely a master dice player and was smart . But  his intelligence is overblown. I don't recall any super genius plan of his, and definitely Mahabharata is not just a chess game between Krishna and Shakuni like people think. He was nowhere near Krishna. \n\nAdmittedly I can't recall other genius plans, I'd like to know if there is any story that shows Shakuni plotting. \n\n(4) Arjuna hated Karna - The rivalry was more one-sided. Karna wanted to prove himself as the best warrior and better than Arjuna. Narada Muni says that there aren't warriors that can beat Arjuna and Karna implying that they are the best, hence Karna wanted to prove himself better than Arjuna and built up hatred and jealousy for that reason from schooldays itself. \n\nBut Arjuna did not really hate Karna. He was indifferent. He only focused on bettering his skills. When Bhima takes the vow that Arjuna shall kill Karna in Kurukshetra after Vastraharana is probably when his anger starts. Even then it's not such an intense feeling from his side - he definitely is angry at Karna but the intense rivalry is more from Karna's side.\n \n(5) Krishna is a morally gray character - No, in fact He and Vyasa Mahamuni (I would add Vidura too) are the whitest characters morally. It is known to everyone that where there is Dharma, there is Krishna and that where there is Krishna there is Dharma. Hence even the Kauravas showed respect before the war. Krishna was immensely respected and it was known that He is always, always on the side of Dharma. \n\nNot once did He transgress morality or the words of the scriptures, in fact when He is reviving Parikshith one of the statements He says is \"If I have never told a lie, let this child be revived\" . So definitely He never lied. \n\n(6) Krishna is bound by Karma, that is why He could not escape Gandhari's curse - Krishna is free to do whatever He wants. Not just Him, no jnani is bound by Karma, He declares this emphatically in the Bhagavad Gita which is found in Mahabharata. Second, it is not that He can't escape Gandhari's curse - \"Krishna suffered it to take place although he was fully competent to baffle it. Govinda was able to alter the very course of the universe with all its mobile and immobile creatures. What need then be said of the curse of even high-souled Brahmanas? \" - Veda Vyasa Mahamuni says this in Mausala Parva Section VIII. \n\n\n\nJai Sita Rama", "Snakes & Ladders - Moksha & Advaitam", "In the game SMITE where various gods from various religions battle, Ganesha has been recently added.

It also caused me to reflect on the story of Yudhisthira and the dice game.

After the fact, while he is still held to have been on the right side of things, both he and Draupadi find it difficult to forgive his actions.\n\nIt could of course be said that all the events of the Mahabharata took place in accordance with Krishna's plan, still the book also seems to speak poorly of King Dhritrashtra's perspective that destiny is unchangeable, so there's no sense in trying to make things better.\n\nThat being said, what are your thoughts on Yudhisthira and the dice game?

He never asked for any wish or boon from Sri Krishna. When Krishna was at the verge of completing His Avatar, he called Uddhava and said,\u2018 Dear Uddhava, in this avatar of mine, many people have asked and received boons from me; but you never asked me anything. Why don\u2019t you ask something now? I will give you. Let me complete this avatar with the satisfaction of doing something good for you also.\u2019  \n>  \n>Even though Uddhava did not ask anything for himself, he had been observing Krishna from his childhood. He had always wondered about the apparent disconnect between Krishna\u2019s teachings and actions, and wanted to understand the reasons for the same. He asked Krishna, \u2018Lord, you taught us to live in one way, but you lived in a different way. In the drama of Mahabharat, in the role you played, in your actions, I did not understand many things. I am curious to understand the reasons for your actions. Would you fulfil my desire to know?\u2019  \n>  \n>Krishna said, \u2018Uddhava, what I told Arjuna during the war of Kurukshetra was Bhagavad Gita. Today, my responses to you would be known as \u2018Uddhava Gita\u2019. That is why I gave this opportunity to you. Please ask without hesitation.\u2019  \n>  \n>Uddhava starts asking \u2013 \u2018Krishna, first tell me who is a real friend?\u2019  \n>  \n>Krishna says, \u2018The real friend is one who comes to the help of his friend in need even without being called.\u2019  \n>  \n>Uddhava: \u2018Krishna, you were a dear friend of the Pandavas. They trusted you fully as Apadhbhandava (protector from all difficulties). Krishna, you not only know what is happening, but you know what is going to happen. You are a great gyani. Just now you gave the definition of a true, close friend. Then why did you not act as per that definition. Why did you not stop Dharmaraj (Yudhishtra) from playing the gambling game? Ok, you did not do it; why did you not turn the luck in favour of Dharmaraj, by which you would have ensured that dharma wins. You did not do that also. You could have at least saved Dharmaraj by stopping the game after he lost his wealth, country and himself. You could have released him from the punishment for gambling. Or, you could have entered the hall when he started betting his brothers. You did not do that either. At least when Duryodhana tempted Dharmaraj by offering to return everything lost if he betted Draupadi (who always brought good fortune to Pandavas), you could have intervened and with your divine power you could have made the dices roll in a way that is favorable to Dharmaraj. Instead, you intervened only when Draupadi almost lost her modesty and now you claim that you gave clothes and saved Draupadi\u2019s modesty; how can you even claim this \u2013 after her being dragged into the hall by a man and disrobed in front of so many people, what modesty is left for a woman? What have you saved? Only when you help a person at the time of crisis, can you be called \u2018Apadhbandhava\u2019. If you did not help in the time of crisis, what is the use? Is it Dharma?\u2019  \n>  \n>As Uddhava posed these questions, tears started rolling from his eyes.  \n>  \n>These are not the questions of Uddhava alone. All of us who have read Mahabharata have these questions. On behalf of us, Uddhava had already asked Krishna.  \n>  \n>Bhagavan Krishna laughed. \u2018Dear Uddhava, the law of this world is: \u2018only the one who has Viveka (intelligence through discrimination), wins\u2019. While Duryodhana had Viveka, Dharmaraj lacked it. That is why Dharmaraj lost.\u2019  \n>  \n>Uddhava was lost and confused. Krishna continues \u2018While Duryodhana had lots of money and wealth to gamble, he did not know how to play the game of dice. That is why he used his Uncle Shakuni to play the game while he betted. That is Viveka. Dharmaraj also could have thought similarly and offered that I, his cousin, would play on his behalf. If Shakuni and I had played the game of dice, who do you think would have won? Can he roll the numbers I am calling or would I roll the numbers he is asking. Forget this. I can forgive the fact that he forgot to include me in the game. But, without viveka, he did another blunder. He prayed that I should not come to the hall as he did not want me to know that through ill-fate he was compelled to play this game. He tied me with his prayers and did not allow me to get into the hall; I was just outside the hall waiting for someone to call me through their prayers. Even when Bheema, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva were lost, they were only cursing Duryodhana and brooding over their fate; they forgot to call me. Even Draupadi did not call me when Dusshasan held her hair and dragged her to fulfil his brother\u2019s order. She was also arguing in the hall, based on her own abilities. She never called me. Finally good sense prevailed; when Dusshasan started disrobing her, she gave up depending on her own strength, and started shouting \u2018Hari, Hari, Abhayam Krishna, Abhayam\u2019 and shouted for me. Only then I got an opportunity to save her modesty. I reached as soon as I was called. I saved her modesty. What is my mistake in this situation?\u2019  \n>  \n>\u2018Wonderful explanation, Kanha, I am impressed. However, I am not deceived. Can I ask you another question\u2019, says Uddhava. Krishna gives him the permission to proceed.  \n>  \n>\u2018Does it mean that you will come only when you are called! Will you not come on your own to help people in crisis, to establish justice?\u2019, asks Uddhava.  \n>  \n>Krishna smiles, \u2018Uddhava, in this life everyone\u2019s life proceeds based on their own Karma. I don\u2019t run it; I don\u2019t interfere in it. I am only a \u2018witness\u2019. I stand close to you and keep observing whatever is happening. This is God\u2019s Dharma.\u2019  \n>  \n>\u2018Wow, very good Krishna. In that case, you will stand close to us, observe all our evil acts; as we keep committing more and more sins, you will keep watching us. You want us to commit more blunders, accumulate sins and suffer\u2019, says Uddhava.  \n>  \n>Krishna says, \u2019Uddhava, please realise the deeper meaning of your statements. When you understand & realise that I am standing as witness next to you, how could you do anything wrong or bad. You definitely cannot do anything bad. You forget this and think that you can do things without my knowledge. That is when you get into trouble. Dharmaraj\u2019s ignorance was that he thought he can play the game of gambling without my knowledge. If Dharmaraj had realized that I am always present with everyone in the form of \u2018Sakshi\u2019 (witness), then wouldn\u2019t the game have finished differently?\u2019  \n>  \n>Uddhava was spellbound and got overwhelmed by Bhakti. He said, \u2018What a deep philosophy. What a great truth! Even praying and doing pooja to God and calling Him for help are nothing but our feeling / belief. When we start believing that nothing moves without Him, how can we not feel his presence as Witness? How can we forget this and act? Throughout Bhagavad Gita, this is the philosophy Krishna imparted to Arjuna. He was the charioteer as well as guide for Arjuna, but he did not fight on his own.\u2019 \u2013 Realize that Ultimate Sakshi/ Witnesser within & without you! And Merge in that God-Consciousness! Discover Thy Higher Self \u2013 The Pure Loveful & Blissful Supreme Consciousness! \u2013 Tat Tvam Asi!\n\nTL;DR; Krishna smiles, \u2018Uddhava, in this life everyone\u2019s life proceeds based on their own Karma.

For example, the advisor of Dhritarashtra, Sanjaya, who perhaps isn't as well known as the Pandavas or Kauravas, but definitely had a significant impact. So characters such as these which are interesting in maybe even their own aspects, but still worth a story to be told.\n\nI hope I'm clear as to what sort of help I need from the redditors.", "Who is right in the discussion between Draupadi, Bheema and Yudhishthira in the forest after they are exiled?After the game of dice, they are exiled to a forest. Then they have this intense debate about it, as to whether they should have accepted this terrible fate from some clearly evil people, or should have fought back.\n\nI myself, reading about the game of dice was furious and could not understand why they wouldn't do anything, even during Draupadi's humiliation, and then to be called back to play AGAIN after all of that... But of course, Yudhishthira makes some beautiful arguments for cultivating dharma above all else.\n\nStill, I felt, at the end, that text itself was inconclusive. Like the authors are presenting the debate for us to interpret and consider, without highlighting one side as obviously superior in every case. Most of us won't lose our livelihoods and our family in a casino. And most of us don't have any prophesies of things we know are going to happen in our lives. Here and now, in our mundane existences, much of Draupadi's and Bheema's words also seem very wise and applicable.\n \nIs there a consensus about this debate? Is there anything I'm missing?", "One year death celebration giftOur neighbors will be having their one year death ritual this weekend, as their mother passed a year ago now.

After taking darshan, we found a quiet spot to sit and watch, over in a corner back behind the Siva sanctum. (We are never in a hurry on such pilgrimages, preferring to take time to take it all in.) So eventually along comes an older man with his bright little granddaughter in tow. Obviously the two of them have come to the temple for some outing. She's dressed for temple. As they approach us, her eyes get bigger as we sort of stand out, being white. It may be the first time she's seen a white pair of devotees in traditional garb like we wear. As they get closer  it's obvious she's really curious. So I say, \"You speak English?\" \n\nLo and behold she does ... fluently.  The Granddad also does but not as well. But his years of experience allow him to shut up and let her talk. And she does, as do we. We discuss her favorite God, her favorite part of the temple, how often she comes, her family and why she come on Fridays with Appappa. She asks us where we're from, how we became Hindu, what we think of India, and more. I'm guessing it's half an hour or so. But the really impressive thing was the ability to parent by the man ... the patience, the smiles at watching his dear granddaughter and the opportunity. \n\nAnd it could have been so much worse. He could have tugged her away.\n\nAum", "Question about Hinduism and empathyIf Hinduism asserts the nature of the world is Lila, or a divine play, and also that Tat Tvam Asi, or \u201cYou\u2019re it\u201d, is the nature of people, then how do Hindus have empathy/compassion? It seems that if the world is just a game/joke/play, and people are an expression of Brahman all playing their various roles and getting lost in their act, then it would be difficult to be empathetic because none of it is serious, fundamentally. If someone is deeply lost in their role, it\u2019s just a superb ability to lose one\u2019s nature in the play.\n\nI have never studied Hinduism so my understanding of these concepts could be incorrect.

I've have heard and read that this is in fact possible however since achieving moksha is the ultimate goal of Hinduism and therefore being reincarnated as a god isn't the end of your soul's journey(samsara) (excuse me if I used the wrong term). Then how do you go on from God? Can Gods die, because they would have to in order to be reincarnated right? And if so are many of the most famous gods in Hinduism already dead or does a new individual take on the form of a god/goddesses role?\n\nSorry if this question is confusing, but I would love to hear some responses. Thank you.", "A DETAILED ARTICLE BY MAANOJ RAKHIT ON HINDU CASTE SYSTEM&#x200B;\n\n**The basics before you proceed**\n\nThere is something you may want to understand well before you proceed any further. If your slate/page is full you won't have any place to write on it until you clean it up well. Similarly, your mind, your thoughts, your emotions \u2014almost your whole being\u2014is covered with a blanket. This blanket is made of primarily three components - your religion, your education system and media around you. Using (or abusing) the Media (the immensely powerful tool that it is) you are constantly being bombarded with what you *should know*. These *invisible shackles* are too demanding to let you lose. \n\nYou may think that you are free to form your independent opinion\u2014almost about anything\u2014but the truth happens to be otherwise. You are also constantly reminded that you are making an informed choice but the reality is opposite. You never realize that you are always being fed with selective information. Your religious guides tell you what they want you to know. Much the same is the case with your educators and your media. Your psyche formation \u2014right from your childhood through adolescence to the adulthood\u2014takes place under their guidance. And, my objective is to break that cordon of cultivated misinformation, and the resultant ignorance.\n\nWhen an Untruth is repeated thousand times it begins to sound like truth. When it is repeated hundreds of thousands of time it becomes The Truth, and the real truth becomes the Untruth. Your school textbooks are the best tool to achieve this fate. From the very childhood your brains are washed thoroughly leading you to a make believe world of which you have no direct experience because it relates to that Past where \"you\" were not Present!\n\nYour direct experiences of today (if any) are projected as the direct outcome of that remote past of which you have no true experience, except whatever you may have been told via your textbooks, your religious guides, and media stories. Guides of organized religions have their own agenda that itself guides their thought and action, and based on that they guide the thoughts and actions of their followers. Contents of educational textbooks and media coverage get widely influenced by the images that their religious guides have helped them form over generations. If there remains any question of doubt it is duly taken care of by those who control things from behind the scene, the very support system which regulates breathing of educational institutions and media outlets (that is the inflow of finances and the power centers). \n\nThe repetition which has carefully shaped the untruth as truth can only be neutralized by equal amount of repetition. And therefore, you must not frown upon any repetition in my works, though they are often not verbatim repetitions. You may as well enjoy reading them. 25-10-2007\n\n**On gross social injustice in form of caste system**\n\nSome of you may have read *Seed-2* and some of you may not have. I receive plenty of feedback from my readers and I know that most often people do not get on hand the first book first. They get at random one of the books from someone and start reading it. It simply does not happen that they have access to all my works so that they can read them sequentially. Hence, those who have not read *Seed-2*, for them, the following section will be helpful. And for those who may have read *Seed-2*, for them, it may serve as recapitulation. Some arguments may be common with *Seed-2* and some not\u2014to support the same case a different logic may have been used.\n\n*When you think of Caste system you think of gross social injustice towards a very large section of Hindu society. And Hindu Braahman is said to be the main culprit behind this injustice. This theory has been so well propagated that people today simply find no need to apply their mind. Just like any other superstition or blind faith they believe in this theory. Whenever any such propaganda driven theory is popularized with purpose, there is always some hidden beneficiary. Who all were those\u2014that I have discussed elsewhere\u2014I wouldn\u2019t want to get sidetracked here\u2014so let us stick to the point.* \n\nHindu society\u2019s foundation was based on 4-Varn System: Braahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shoodr Varn. 16th century Christian missionaries coined a new term for this: Caste system. 19th century fiercely-Christian T B Macaulay introduced Christian Missionary driven English Education System by systematically eliminating Ancient Hindu Education System in BhaaratVarsh. Christian educators slowly poisoned the minds of unsuspecting Hindu children against Braahmans. 20th century Nehru dynasty pampered Marxist-fake-Secularist educators who continued the process with greater enthusiasm. Education system, newspapers, magazines, cinema, every possible media was used. With continued repetition every one came to believe that Hindu society practiced gross social injustice in the name of Caste system. Now look at these documented testimonies that give you a totally opposite picture. These testimonies were carefully kept out of your view for long, though they existed all along! You must read them and ask yourself a question\u2014 \n\n*Can the foundation of Hindu society be based on gross social injustice when \u2018justice and truthfulness\u2019 has been the lifeblood of the Hindu Society through the ages?*\n\nMax Muller filled 37 pages with examples of Hindu Justice and Hindu love for Truth and he said that he could go on quoting many-many more. To top it he titled the chapter as *Truthful Character of the Hindus* in his book *INDIA what can it teach us?* He categorically stated (p.50): \"Now, it is quite true that during the two thousand years which precede the time of Mahmud of Gazni, BhaaratVarsh has had but (\\*not) few foreign visitors, and few foreign critics; *still it is extremely strange that whenever,* either in Greek, or in Chinese, or in Persian, or in Arab writings, *we meet any attempts at* describing the distinguishing features in the national character of the Indians (\\*Hindus), regard for truth and justice *should always be mentioned first*.\"\n\nHe goes on to state (p.59): \"I have left to the last of the witness who might otherwise have been suspected\u2014I mean the Hindus themselves. The whole of their literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth.\" \n\n*Now tell me\u2014do you think a society could have all along practiced gross social injustice towards its own people, a society whose whole literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth?*\n\nAnd why does he say \"I have left to the last of the witness who might otherwise have been suspected\"? He knew that his audience (ICS aspirants at Cambridge University in England 1882) would think these were for talk not for practice. *Therefore, he cited numerous facts based on Hindu life style and conducts before he moved to Hindu literature so that his audience realizes that the teachings of Hinduism were truly reflected in the conduct of the Hindus\u2014and that is the real test\u2014the speech and action must corroborate, or else, it\u2019s fake.*\n\nBefore Christ was born, 5th Century, Greek physician Ktesias dedicated in his works a special chapter on Justice of the Hindus. *Hindu Justice could not have been exemplary to Greeks if Hindu social structure was truly based on a system of gross social injustice towards the vast majority of its own people.* *This is nothing but plain logic and you do not need vast degree of intelligence to understand it.* Nevertheless, let us proceed with (a) what other observers documented about the Hindu society over a period as large as two thousand and four hundred years and (b) *witness the kind of consistency those documentations reflect at.* \n\nBefore Christ was born, 4th Century, Greek Ambassador Megasthenes spoke of Hindu love for Truth and that no Hindu was a slave. *Now tell me, how is it that Megasthenes documented in 4th century BC that \"no Hindu was a slave\" in a society that is supposed to have practiced gross social injustice in form of infamous Caste system?* \n\nAfter Christ was born, 2nd Century, Greek Arrian the pupil of Epictetus said Hindus were never accused of lying. 7th Century Chinese Hiouen-thsang spoke of Hindu Straightforward Honesty and Never Unjust nature. *How is it that a society, accused of practicing gross social injustice towards its own people, has been praised by Hiouen-thsang putting it on record \u2018with regard to justice, Hindus make even excessive concessions\u2019?* \n\n11th Century Muslim Conqueror spoke of Hindu Justice, Good Faith, Honesty and Fidelity. *Once again, it has been said that \u2018Hindus were naturally inclined to justice and never depart from it in their actions\u2019. How could they have allowed social injustice of the kind they were accused of by Christian educators and Communist educators?* Ever wonder if they were educators by profession or professional liars? *What was their objective? Did they want Hindu children to get cut off from their mainstream religious and cultural base and begin to look for alternative with (a) Christianity in ChristianBritish days (b) with Communism/Marxism in so-called post-independence days?*\n\n13th Century Italian Marco Polo spoke of **Hindu Braahmans** as the most Truthful, for they would not tell a lie for anything on earth! *Now ask yourself, who have been lying all along? These people from different origins, from different centuries, who came and visited Hindus and came to invariably the same conclusion? Or, Christian missionaries who had the hidden agenda to convert Hindus into Christianity by hook or crook? Or, Communist-Marxist historians of AMU and JNU who had a hidden agenda to spread their wings so they could keep their illegitimately acquired hold over Hindu society?* All fraudsters have a brotherhood kind of feeling and they support each other. This is what these Christians and Communists had been doing but simpleton Hindus did not see through their foul play. Wake up my Hindu nation and try to understand their game plan. \n\nOn the other hand, only three centuries later, the Saint of Christianity named Francis Xavier of 16th century (we will soon see what other people of 16th century have to say) calls Hindu Braahmans as perverse, wicked and crafty men and terms all Hindus as unholy race (Seed-5). Such happens to be the character of a Saint of Christianity. So, you can well imagine what would be the character of the lesser ones than a Saint. *When their ulterior motives are not otherwise fulfilled, they resort to tarnishing the image of others, and in doing so they reveal their own \u2018wicked and crafty nature\u2019.* The same applies to the ChristianEnglish educated ChristianizedHindus, and CommunistMarxist thinkers who adopted such questionable methods to raise their own social status by fraudulently reducing others. And, on that premise they built their imaginary theory of so-called **Oppressive Braahmanism** so that they could discredit the Braahmans, and occupy their coveted position in the Hindu society which these characters were not worthy of. Using (rather abusing) their hold over administrative machinery and educational system, they filled Hindu children\u2019s minds with the filth that the Braahmans practiced much despised caste system and untouchability to retain their own superiority and their hold over Hindu society. *In the process, they not only* *tarnished the image of Braahmans in Hindu society, but effectively persecuted Hinduism itself on a much wider scale.* Their motive was simple: convert the Hindus into Christians. Communists followed the lead and used the same technique. Their motive was equally simple: convert the Hindus into Communists/Marxists. \n\n13th Century Muslims spoke of Hindus Free of all deceit, violence and fear of death. *And, Hindu Braahmans have been accused by Christians and Communists for deceit and violence in form of gross social injustice!* The foundation on which the Christians and the Communists built their propaganda was the **imaginary** theory of Aryan Invasion (Seed-2) and establishment of so-called (imaginary) oppressive Braahmanism. *This in itself was a fraud against humanity, and deceit of high order. This crooked theory has caused immense harm to the humanity.* \n\n14th Century Friar Jordanus speaks of Hindus True in Speech and Eminent in Justice. *But same Hindus are accused of gross social injustice by our Christian educators and Marxist intellectuals.* Must you continue to respect these liars who committed social fraud on you? *Ask Hindus, ask yourself. Don\u2019t you owe at least, that much to yourself?* How long do you wish to live under the spell of these crooks that taught you nothing but lie?\n\n15th Century Persian Ambassador spoke of Perfect Security that Merchants enjoyed in our country. *Hindu Kshatriyas fulfilled their duty not only towards their own people but also towards foreign traders and an average Hindu fulfilled his duty towards the society at large.* And, what have these crooks given you now after destroying the social fabric of Hindu society? \n\n16th Century Muslim Minister Abul Fazl spoke of Hindu Truthfulness, gratefulness, and unbounded Fidelity and Never flies from Battlefield type character. *This was true of every Hindu Kshatriya\u2014when he left for the battle field his mother would tell him that \"the day has arrived for which Kshatraanis (Kshatriya women) breast fed their milk to their children and the time has come to repay that debt!\"* And, what these Christian educators have taught you all along, that, Hindus were so much divided all the time that they could not face the Muslims. Besides, lowering your self-esteem what else have they given you? Have they given you the knowledge that has benefited you, or have they cheated on you while maintaining a poker face all the while? 19th Century common Muslims spoke of Hindu Straightforwardness. Do you find any trace of straightforwardness in these Christian and Marxist educators? Why do you still continue to let them remain your educators? \n\nMax Muller compares legendary Hindu honesty with English and French, and finds it superior to the Europeans. He also mentioned that he can go on quoting book after book and you will find that no one ever accused Hindus of falsehood. *Think, my dear fellows, think, can the Truthfulness of this magnitude survive in a society allegedly ridden with social injustice? Or, the allegation itself has been fraudulent, and a fabrication with ulterior motive?* We will deal with those motives, in detail, in our other books. You will see from historical evidence that historical frauds have been so common with Christianity from its very inception that it has become the second nature of Christianity. 18th century Warren Hastings \\[India\u2019s First Governor General 1774-1784\\] spoke of Hindus as Less prompted to Vengeance for Wrong Inflicted than any people on the face of the earth. This is probably the reason that Hindus continue to tolerate these fraudsters, who have perpetrated social fraud of such magnitude that they have destroyed a great civilization that lasted thousands of years until these crooks arrived on the scene. Expect me not to use better adjectives for them\u2014they should be identified as they have been and as they are. Bishop Heber spoke of Hindus as more easily affected by kindness and attention to their wants and feelings than any people he ever met with. *This is probably the reason that Hindus respected Christianity looking at handful of honest Christians like these counted few.* \n\nElphinstone spoke of Hindus about their freedom from gross debauchery. *People who live a life of purity, they do not indulge into the kind of gross social injustice they have been accused of,* by Christian educators and communist educators. \n\nSir Thomas Munro, the eminent Governor of Madras, spoke that Hindus were not inferior to the nations of Europe and he was convinced that England had more to gain if Civilization became an article for trade between BhaaratVarsh and England. *Do you think Sir Thomas Munro would have said something like this if our Hindu society were ridden with social injustice of the kind these Christian and Marxist educators have told us, and told the world?* \n\nProf. Wilson spoke of better quality of Hindu Honesty at Calcutta Mint than other mints elsewhere in the world. *Do you think that the people who cannot have any social justice within their social framework can have people commonly as honest as indicated here?* \n\nProf. Wilson spoke of **Braahman Simplicity truly Childish**. *Do you think that these Braahmans could have been credited with such childish simplicity if they happened to be such dirty people, who were alleged to have created this treacherous caste system for their own benefit?* Look at the statement (see *Seed-5 Christianity in a different Light\u2014Face behind the Mask*) of St. Xavier, which painted Braahmans as perverse and wicked. Look at his reason, which he himself described to the Society of Jesus. *Xavier could not convert many Hindus into Christianity. His ulterior motive was hurt. So, he painted Braahmans in such bad light. His successors did the same thing. Later day missionary educated Hindus parroted what their teachers had taught them. Realize that you have learned the falsehood from your Christian educators and you have spread that falsehood further through television serials, movies, newspapers, etc. Now you must stop and reverse that process, which you too are responsible to some extent but only as the pawns in the hands of those master conspirators, who fooled you and cheated you all along.* If anyone is to be despised, it is not **Braahmans** but these cheats called Christian educators and Communist-Marxist educators.\n\nColonel Sleeman has put on record that he had before him hundreds of cases, in which a man\u2019s property, liberty, and life depended upon his telling a lie, and he refused to tell it. Max Muller then asks: Can many an English judge say the same? *Could our so-called wretched caste system and a socially unjust society have produced such truthful Hindus incomparable elsewhere?* Do you realize the significance of this sentence: Can many an English judge say the same? *By deductive logic, if the outcome was so great, then the foundation also had to be equally great. And, that foundation was the 4-Varn System.* People with vested interest speak against it. People of ignorance keep parroting the same. Today, if we do not see any trace of such legendary truthfulness amongst Hindus, it is because these Hindus have become Christianized-Hindus, under the very bad influence of six generation of English-Christian Education System, which Macaulay instituted as he wanted to Christianize the Hindus. \n\nMax Muller says that for past two thousand years Greeks, Chinese, Persian, Arabs, all described the most distinguishing feature of Hindu society as its regard for truth and justice, *but for two hundred years English-Christian education system taught Hindus that the most distinguishing feature of Hindu society was its social injustice in form of 4-Varn System, which they renamed as caste system.* Were these Christian educationists lying all along? *Was their lie part of a much bigger conspiracy against Hindu society? Was it to bleed Hindu society to death?* \n\nEnglish Merchants spoke that commercial Honor stood higher in India (BhaaratVarsh) than in any other country. Why we do not see any evidence of it today? *Is it because Christian educators have completely ruined the sense of ethics amongst Hindus? Educators, who themselves posses no ethics, what else can they pass on to their pupil?* *If they themselves were not truthful, then how could you expect to learn anything about justice from them?* \n\nYou must understand this basic fact: *if the foundation is* *based on fraud, its outcome will also be fraud. In this context, English-Christian education system\u2019s foundation was based on fraud against Hindu society. Their purpose was ignoble. Their intentions were conspiratorial. There was simply no regard for truth and justice in their belief system. Therefore, they produced crops like themselves. Students of their education system, through next six generations, gradually continued to become fraudulent like their teachers. They lost regard for truth and justice that happened to be cherished Ethos of Hindu society until two centuries ago!* \n\nMax Muller wrote the whole of Hindu literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth. He expressed doubt whether in any other of the ancient literatures of the world you will find traces of that extreme sensitiveness of conscience which despairs of our ever speaking the truth. *Now, ask yourself a question. Here stood Hindu society which practiced truth and justice by thought, speech and action for thousands of years, and with consistency. Could there have existed, unnoticed by all concerned, the gross social injustice of such magnitude in form of the infamous caste system? Was it the brainchild of those conspirators, who converted into reality of today, something that was nonexistent in the days of which they spoke of?* \n\nMax Muller writes, Hindus may teach us at least one lesson of truthfulness, that is, truthfulness to ourselves. *What did Christian educators do? Instead of learning that truthfulness from Hindus, they destroyed the truthfulness of Hindus.* This is what you acquire from an Aasuric religion like Christianity. They have destroyed your sense of ethics, justice, truthfulness all that you ever valued. \n\n*If it was all so good for 24 centuries continuously, as documented in the testimonies of non-Hindu visitors to this Hindu land, then what went wrong in less than two centuries? The answer is simple. Keeping all factors constant, the only variable on the scene is the presence of Aasuric influence of Christianity, which has eclipsed the Hindu society.* \n\n**Braahmans were the poorest of all**\n\n*It generally takes longer to build than to dismantle! Not for centuries, but for millenniums,* ***Braahmans*** *played the exemplary role. They themselves lived as the poorest of the lot but raised rich morals among the rest in the society. And, ample evidence of such rich morals, as documented by many-many foreign visitors to this Hindu land over more than two millenniums, you have already seen.* Do you remember the legendry poor *Dronaachaarya* who could not buy milk for his only child *Ashwatthaama*? Do you remember poor *Sudaama* who could only carry few grams when he went to meet his childhood friend Shri Krishn? Do you remember the stories that you read during your childhood? Whenever the central figure of the story happened to be a Braahman, did those stories not begin as \"Once upon a time there was a poor Braahman\"? Can you remember any story \"Once upon a time there was a rich Braahman\"? Well, I would not be surprised if you manage to find me one of them created during past fifty odd years by one of those MarxistCommunist intellectual professors of JNU who have mastered the technique of fabricating history in connivance with their bedfellow AMU professors. You will find enough evidence of such historical fabrications in *Seed-1.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNow I invite you to take a special note of the fact that all the testimonies that I have presented before, are \n\n\u2022 Not by people who had a specific mission \n\n\u2022 Not by people who subscribed to a single ideology \n\n\u2022 Not by people who were part of a single theology \n\n\u2022 Not by people who were in any way connected with each other by an invisible thread \n\n\u2022 Not by people who had any reason to carry any special leaning in favor of the Hindus \n\n\u2022 Not by people who could be accused by any stretch of imagination that they were working together towards building a specific image for the Hindus. What does this all convey to you?\n\nThe extraordinary character and integrity of Hindu society was incomparable in the recorded history of mankind, and therefore, I see no reason whatsoever to be defensive about our ancient 4-Varn System and try to explain it away apologetically in the manner many modern interpreters tend to do. *It is their own low self-esteem that makes them do so. Their knowledge is of no use if they cannot see through the game plan of those conspirators who have brought their self-esteem to this low level.* \n\n*It is our 4-Varn System that prevented extinction of Hindu society under thousand years of barbaric Islam invasion, whereas* financially supported (by Hindus) one-class (monk based) Buddhist society was totally wiped out from BhaaratVarsh on account of the same Islamic invasion. \n\nHindu Society that was known for its regard for Justice over two thousand years \\[5th Century BC-AD 19th Century\\]. *Such society could not have been practicing gross social injustice within its own framework.

", "Is this legend actually a part of Hinduism?Hello there, \n\nThere is an old legend that I have heard many times which is basically meant as a fable to warn against agreeing to something without thinking it through completely.  Or also in my case as a way to think about how fast exponential growth is (I am a math teacher)\n\nIt goes something like this:\n\nWhen the game of chess was invented in ancient India it became extremely popular through out the country.  In particular there was a king that was especially fond of the game and quite good at it.  He was so confident in his abilities he made a challenge to his subjects that if someone could beat him at the game he would grant them any prize that was in his power to give.\n\nMany people attempted to beat the king but all failed, until eventually a timid man came forward to take the challenge and actually ended up winning the game.\n\nThe king being very impressed with the man's skill asked what the man would like for his prize and the man responded:\n\nWhat I want is this: on the first square of the chess board place one grain of rice, on the second square of the chess board place two grains of rice, on the third square of the chessboard place four grains of rice and so on doubling the amount of rice on each square until you get to the end.\n\nThe king laughed at the seemingly humble request and called to his assistant to fetch a bag of rice from the store room.\n\nHowever the Kings accountants quickly realized that the mans request was far from humble, because if we went on continuing to double the number of rice on each square by the time we got to the 64th square there would be 2^63 grains of rice, or 9,220,000,000,000,000,000  or 9.2 Quintilian grains.  Which is more rice then the entire planet could produce in a thousand years.\n\nWhen the king realized the blunder he made by accepting to give this to the man, the man revealed himself to be the Hindu god Krishna (If I remember correctly, I could be wrong about their name)  and Krishna told the king that he did not expect payment right away and could be paid over time.  And so to this day people still offer rice to the god as penance for the arrogance that he displayed.\n\n\n\n\nAgain I just like this story because it illustrates exponential growth and the idea of \"look before you leap\"  But I wanted to know if this story was actually part of Hindu tradition, if it was actually Krishna or a different god,  and if it is not a part of Hindu cannon is it offensive to tell the story this way?  Because I think it is kind of like poetic justice to have it end that way.\n\n\nAny thoughts or comments are welcome, thanks!", "Krishna Consciousness What is Paradise? Would it be some kind of situation in which every desire is satisfied? That would be a hollow kind of joy, and anyway, there would always be some unavoidable conflict with others wanting different things. Actually to want some kind of immortality as an individual ego is something very shallow, true joy begins where false ego ends.\n\nSo a more sophisticated explanation is something like \u201cNirvana\u201d as it is described by certain Buddhist schools, the complete destruction and dissolution of all ego. It is clear that false ego is the primary cause of suffering, with all of the subconscious games it plays keeping us caught up in empty fascination. Hence the contemplative techniques, meditative techniques, found in all serious forms of religion, which are designed to help us see through our own selves, to look within and see the face beyond the masks. *\u201cWho looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes\u201d*, said Carl Jung.\n\nYet there is something unsatisfying about this. Ego-Death is a kind of death after all. There is something fundamental to humanity, the desire to live, something about the experience of being human which makes us wary of annihilation, even if it be a form of peace beyond that of individual existence. There is a natural desire to live, to be a human being, even if *\u201clife is suffering\u201d* as Buddha taught. This instinct often leads us away from religion, into the life of the senses and worldly pursuits for gain, but it can also lead us to a more holistic, more total, conception of a Paradise.\n\nKrishna Consciousness begins with the notion that we are all originally servants of God, whose qualities are encapsulated and present in the name KRISHNA. To be liberated from suffering is to return to our original position as servants of God, rather than as servants of the senses and of our desires. As God is in every way perfect, serving God is therefore the highest form of bliss any soul can attain.  \n\nUntil we turn away from the material life and engage in the Devotional Service of Krishna, again and again we are cast into physical bodies in order to satisfy particular desires and in accordance with the results of our previous actions. Just as the body changes from youth to old age but the soul remains the same, so do we change bodies but remain the same spiritual spark of consciousness. Returning to our original position, seeking to again become servants of Krishna, is the way to freedom from this cycle of Death and Rebirth known as Samsara. Thus it is taught that through Devotional Service we will attain rebirth on one of the spiritual planets collectively known as Vaikuntha and continue forever serving Krishna in His presence.\n\nThis whole conception quite nicely synthesises the other two conceptions of Paradise as Eternal Bliss or Ego Annihilation. What\u2019s more, Krishna Conscious philosophy also includes in itself these other forms of Liberation or Paradise, which it considers to be partial and temporary. The worshippers of Demigods after the death of this body go to different planets where fulfilling the desires of the senses is very easy, before eventually returning to earthly realms. The \u201cMayavadis\u201d and Buddhists who seek Ego-Annihilation are dissolved in the light emanating from Krishna, also eventually redescending into material creation.\n\nWhat we must understand is that Krishna is not an abstract concept or some incomprehensible effulgence. He is a personality (Vigraha) possessing all opulences. Sat-Chit-Ananda; Eternity, Bliss, and Knowledge. He is the Supreme Personality, qualitatively the same as us but quantitatively superior.  We must understand that Eternal Joy is found in no longer serving the Ego but serving Krishna instead. Everyone must serve something, be it some sectarian religion, their country, their family etc., but the intelligent person takes to serving Godhead. After all, God is the source of all things, the source of all happiness. We simply must accept that we are not and shall never be God, nor shall we find any permanent joy outside of serving Him.  \n\nThis Yoga of Devotional Service, is known by the Sanskrit name of BHAKTI YOGA.\n\nVarious simple rules were put into place by Prabhupada, the founder of the Krishna Consciousness movement in the West, for those wishing to practise Bhakti Yoga. There are four Regulative Principles: 1) No Meat Eating 2) No Gambling 3) No Intoxicants 4) No Illicit Sex, which devotees of Krishna should strive to conform to. In general we must avoid those things which keep us bound up with material nature, identified with the material body rather than the spiritual soul.  \n\nFood should be offered to Krishna before being consumed in order to free us from the Karmic effects of it\u2019s production. We should not eat meat, fish and eggs along with onions and garlic are also prohibited. To kill, even an animal, is against the laws of nature, and cow protection is a central pillar of Krishna Consciousness \u2013 after all, the cow is like our mother, giving us milk. In general asceticism proves useful in returning back to the spiritual planets, back to Godhead, but we should not be extreme:\n\n\u201c*There is no possibility of one's becoming a yogi, O Arjuna, if one eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita As It Is 6:16).*\n\nNonetheless it is quite possible to seek to serve Krishna even if we haven\u2019t mastered the Regulative Principles, any efforts will bear fruit. Most importantly, and before everything else, it is necessary to chant the MAHA MANTRA:\n\nHARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE  \n HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE\n\nThis Mantra, the Holy Name, is not quite like many forms of prayer. We are not asking for anything except to be the servant of Krishna always, there is no question of wanting money or material exaltation. The chanting of the Mantra is compared to a child crying for its mother. It contains all the potencies of Godhead in its transcendental sound vibration. People remark that it is not tiring to chant this mantra as some other mantras can become. Devotees in these times try to chant a minimum of sixteen japa (16 x 108) of this mantra each day, though in the past saints have chanted many more and a few still do today.\n\nThe chanting of Holy Name was widely popularized by the last Avatar of Krishna, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, in the 15th and 16th century. He was the \u201cYuga Avatar\u201d of Krishna, giving the appropriate teaching for the present age. We are currently in what is known as Kali Yuga, the dark age of the cycle of four ages. In this age human life is shorter, there is more suffering, little spirituality or charity and many other negative symptoms. However on the positive side it gives us the opportunity to return to Godhead through the simple process of chanting Hare Krishna. Furthermore it is predicted that humanity will experience a ten-thousand year golden age within Kali Yuga, a time when the chanting of Maha Mantra will be widespread.\n\nWe can abandon all other processes and simply surrender to Krishna. There is no need for any extraneous and sectarian practises beyond this: *\u201cIf you pour water on the root of the tree, the water reaches to the branches, to the twigs, to the leaves, to the flowers, to the fruits automatically\u201d*. God has many names, there are many ways of approaching Him, but the chanting of HARE KRISHNA is the most suitable process for these times. The motto of Krishna Consciousness is:\n\n\u201cSIMPLE LIVING, HIGH THINKING\u201d", "New possibility for seekers to experience an authentic Vedic lifestyleSome of us do not fully fit in this society.

I've been avoiding religious subs because there's too many toxic people.\n\nAfter Karna's coronation as Angh Raj, he spent most of his time with Duryodhana. They would play a game of dice in the evening. One day after sunset, Duryodhana had to leave momentarily. His wife Bhanumati, who was passing by, saw Karna waiting for her husband and decided to continue her husband\u2019s game. At some point they had a casual quarrel about whose turn it was next. Playfully, Karna tried to snatch the dice from her hand. While they were wriggling, Bhanumati's dress shifted out of place, and her pearl necklace broke. The pearls scattered everywhere on the floor. At that instant, Duryodhana entered and found his wife with his friend in a compromising position, with their clothes entangled and pearls all over the floor. Duryodhana asked Karna what the quarrelling was for. Upon knowing the reason he cracked a joke and laughed aloud and continued playing.\n\nLater, when Bhanumati asked Duryodhana why he didn't doubt her, he replied, \"In a relation there is no scope for doubt, for when doubt settles in there will be no relation. Karna is my best friend and I trust him because I have faith that he will never break my trust", "V. D Savarkar on the concept of God. 'God of universe' vs 'God of man' .If we were to hit a rod onto the surface of a flowing stream, the undivided flow of water seems momentarily divided into two streams. In the evening sky, the moment the first star appears and twinkles, the otherwise unending sky appears to have acquired a point of reference, quadrisected into four cardinal directions.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0This material world too, in all its eternity, gets divided into two parts as soon as the star of human awareness starts twinkling.\u00a0 Dichotomies like the beautiful and the ugly, the fragrant and the malodorous, the melodious and the harsh to hear, the soft and the hard, the dear and the unpleasant, the good and the bad, the divine and the evil, and others emerge as soon as human need becomes the point of reference in this cosmos. All that humankind considers good, pleasant and helpful is one part of this world while all that is unpleasant, all that unfavorably or adversely affects human existence is the other part of this world. He who creates the good part is \u201cGod\u201d while he who creates the bad part is the \u201cRakshas\u201d, \u201cAsura\u201d, \u201cSatan\u201d or \u201cDevil\u201d. Accepting these elementary human sensibilities as the working criterion for understanding the usefulness, goodness or badness of the cosmos is quite unavoidable.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Our ancestors realised ages ago that it was impossible to count, analyse, characterize and qualify or quantify each and every living species and non-living entity of this immeasurable and unfathomable universe. Instinctively they chose to analyse the things and beings in the universe using the five senses humankind is gifted with- touch, sight, scent, hearing and taste. Now everything had one or more attributes one could, well, \u201csense\u201d. For example, the rose was red by color, soft to touch and fragrant by scent. While a fruit was sweet or sour by taste, aromatic by scent, cool and wet to touch, with a certain appearance for the eyes. A cuckoo was black to see and sweet to hear. A breeze was cool or warm to feel (to \u201ctouch\u201d) while a sea storm was frightening to hear, forceful to feel and salty to smell. Given the primitive times then, this very idea of using the five senses was a veritable leap of human ingenuity! They developed this thought process to call the five senses representatives of the Pancha Maha Bhootas (The Five Great Elements), namely Pruthvi (Earth or the solid state of matter), Aap (Water or the liquid state of matter), Tej (Fire, light energy or radiations), Vaayu (Wind, air or gaseous state of matter) and Aakash (Outer space, vacuum or the Great Void). Spiritually, they theologized that whatever conversation or dialogue we humans could have with the God of this universe was also through these five senses, hence they even developed the concept of the five-headed deities, like Pancha Mukhi Mahadev, Pancha Mukhi Hanuman or Pancha Mukhi Ganesha.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Just as the process of studying the universe and its objects and beings with our five senses was so natural and instinctive, so were the attempts at trying to figure out if there indeed was any psyche behind the very forces who could create this universe. These forces were deified and became objects of faith across ancient cultures. The thought that came forward was that by creating this bounty and abundance of natural wealth for human prosperity, Nature was indeed very kind-hearted and affectionate like a mother who provided for her children, us human beings. Nature was\u00a0Mother\u00a0Nature,\u00a0Mother\u00a0Earth,\u00a0Mother\u00a0Life, the Goddess \u201cSrushti\u201d or \u201cPrakruti\u201d, who tended to us her children. By psyche she was all that a mother could be- affectionate, loving and providing. This \u201cfaith\u201d has only been reinforced from time to time by the gifts Mother Nature has been showering onto us from time and again onto humankind till today! Likewise the Creator was Father Creator, the powerful \u201cPurusha\u201d, who though so powerful was yet, by psyche, so kind, gentle, caring and compassionate that He laid the very seed of human existence and a habitat to sustain human life!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Truly, for the benefit, utility and happiness of humankind, the compassionate God has created nature with such meticulous paternal love! This sun, this ocean, how majestically big these Great Elements! But the kind God employed even them for the service of humankind. Just as a mother would keep cool sweet water filled up for her kids coming home from their play out in the afternoon sun, so does the \u201cSun-God\u201d, using sunrays as suction conduits, suck up only the water sans the salt from the salty oceans thereby sparing the sweet water of the rivers \u2013 and then store up this distillate in heavenly reservoirs, making it tempting even to the Gods! Just imagine the control mechanism over this saltwater-to-Sweetwater conversion \u2013 only as much capacity is there in the sunrays for this conversion as is the water required in one year and only as much is the water storage capacity of the celestial reservoirs- the clouds. At the same time, the oceans are themselves not turned sweet, sparing our whole life from becoming tastelessly bland!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Look at the animals! They are of various calibers of intelligence and various specializations, as varied as the varieties of services humankind expected of them in the pre-industrial ages! The Gods taught the camels the art of eating desert thorns and going without water for days, adapting them to life in a desert habitat \u2013 and they became the ship of the desert, a lifeline for sustaining human life in the inhospitable harsh desert! And how swift is the horse! God has given him strength and forbearance to both gallop for hours and to manoevour in the midst of a pitched battle all the time balancing and bearing the weight of a human rider for hours. There are many examples of steadfast loyalty where horses have even sacrificed their life for their masters, like the horse Chetak who carried Rana Pratap to safety before dying of exhaustion. Yet God has not over endowed the horse with the intelligence to ride a human being instead. Take the dairy cow or buffalo - one just has to push dry grass from one end to get rich, creamy, fresh, life-giving milk in abundance from the other end. Really, how kind God must be to his human children for creating such a biochemical process as milk formation! What\u2019s more - God endowed the same dairy cow or buffalo that produces milk with the ability to leave behind her own progeny, a reproduced copy, with the very same miraculous biochemical abilities to turn dry unpalatable inedible grass into sweet, creamy milk before she retires or passes away. A milk-vending machine that vends not just milk but also another milk-vending machine!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0One has to sow just one grain of wheat - and it turns into a plant producing more than a hundred grains! Just\u00a0one\u00a0mango \u2013 a divinely juicy, delicious, nutritious, pulpy fruit \u2013 but it comes with its own seed that if sown and nurtured, turns into a majestic tree that gives\u00a0hundreds\u00a0of juicy mangoes for generations of a human family, year after year. Not just that, the mango even appears by branch grafting, producing whole orchards after orchards of the noble fruit in veritable abundance! Rice, millet or other varieties of different foodgrains with different nutrient profiles and tastes grow in all sorts of climatic conditions \u2013 in each case, one gets a whole sack full from one single, sowed grain. The varieties of fruits- pomegranates, bananas, apples, figs, jackfruits, dates\u2026 from different climatic profiles follow the same law - just\u00a0one\u00a0sown seed supplies enough fruit for satisfying the needs of at least a small family! All sorts of tasty, nutritious vegetables grow by themselves when kind of \u201cordered\u201d by the mere act of being sown \u2013 the Lord God made this possible for us his human children! Then there\u2019s sugarcane, after all a mere grass \u2013 with its weed-like propensity to proliferate wherever water is available. But when humans discovered its sweet juice, it just had to be disciplined into growing within the space allotted to it and nurtured by irrigation before it grew into vast lush stretches of such a generous produce that after being squeezed of its last drop of sweet juice by industrial scale sugar extraction processes, can still provide basic roughage to field oxen from leftovers! In fact, today\u2019s scientists in the field of unconventional energy resources are researching the possibility of employing crops like sugarcane and even weeds from hillsides to generate the bio-fuel ethanol just when the world thought its fossil fuels were getting used up! Truly, when one resource dries up, another becomes available! How\u00a0can\u00a0we humans\u00a0ever\u00a0even quantify, leave alone repay, the kindness that God showered on humankind, making arrangements for every aspect of human existence!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0And what about human anatomy!\u00a0 From the soles of our feet to the most microscopic of the organelles of the brain, the layout of the human body is full of masterly, orderly planning and co-ordination- O Lord, how meticulously Thou hath designed our bodies for us! Our\u00a0human\u00a0eye- how many ages, eons, generations of evolutionary experiments hath Thou conducted to bring our eye to its present capabilities? Initially the eye was just a nervous tissue able to merely make out a ray of light, which could only differentiate illumination from utter darkness, recognize a shadow more than actual details of a form; but by continuous evolutionary experiments, trials and errors, we humans now have our beautiful, spherical, moist \u2013 and \u2013\u00a0ambitious\u00a0human eye. Today the human eye is so capable that we humans have the ambitious foresight(!) to beat Thee at Thy own game, by inventing a duplicate eye, an extension, the telescope, to view not just the interiors of Thy own cosmic laboratory of outer space, but to discover none other than\u00a0Thee Thyself\u00a0 somewhere in space!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Further, how\u00a0can\u00a0one ever describe fully the festival of beauty and colours Thou hath conducted in the Three Worlds? The ultra-delicate flower of the Parijaat, the ultra-fragrant Golden Champak flower! The peacock\u2019s vibrant plumage \u2013 the colors and design of every feather, the peacock\u2019s inimitable gait! What a natural artist that noble bird is! When I watch the bird spread his plumage, dance with excitement and cry out aloud, believe me, O God, even my heart dances in sync with every step of this gifted bird and cries out Thy glory in admiration of Thy divine creation. In fact, I feel like sulking that\u00a0I\u00a0do not have the wonderful plumage of the peacock. The whole earthly creation resounds with the songs of birds and is a kaleidoscope of pleasant sights and landscapes! Roses, chamelis, bakulis, Juhis, Jaais, Champak, sandalwood, Ketakis\u2026 creepers and shrubs in full bloom, whole gardens full of them freshening and lending fragrance to the atmosphere! The Gods of love, Madan and Rati, are busy linking the hearts of lovers! The nights are starry, the dawns are pink, youth is confident and fresh, sleep is sound and deep, and love is like a cool breeze heralding the rhapsody of springtime. There is material and spiritual growth all over\u2026 O Lord, how can we humans not help thinking that such a beautiful world was created specially for us by Thee? If we love, nurture, protect and provide for our children, so doth Thee. Thou truly art both our father and mother and we Thy children. Even the milk our mothers give us is given ultimately by you. O Lord, we are Thy devotees and Thou, the Lord God of humankind, the God of Man!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Not just that, Thou art the only God, there can be no other and Thou hath created this world specifically for our peace and prosperity!\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u2026 This ideology, this concept of \u201cThe God of humankind\u201d creating the universe specially for the survival and prosperity of Humankind could indeed have proved truthful and correct \u2013 if and only if everything, every being and all conditions in this world would have been only helpful, pleasant, beneficial and useful to humankind.\u00a0\nBut alas! The cold fact is that most of this earth, the very earth we instinctively consider Mother Earth, Mother Nature and Mother Life is hardly all that safe, protective, kind and considerate to us humans as we were just philosophizing. On the contrary, the living conditions existent on this planet and influences of the atmosphere, the sun, moon and stars in reality seem to contradict our pet theory of faith too much \u2013 conditions that obtain on earth are mostly inhospitable, harsh, with the law of the Jungle working all the time around us. Humankind has to struggle for its very survival and struggle still further for ensuring prosperity.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Take a good look at the very Sun and oceans we sung paeans in praise of just some time ago. The way the unsparing rays of the hot sun finish off a helpless victim of sunstroke or heatstroke is quite comparable to the ruthlessness with which a gatekeeper watchman beats a poisonous snake by repeated relentless blows- striking the final blows even when half-dead. In the very India where millions of Hindu Brahmins offer prayers to the Sun God every sunrise and sunset, the very same sun shines hot for the entire spell of a drought or famine, even lasting several years, killing thousands of heatstroke, hunger or thirst.\u00a0\nIn the Quran, Talmud, Torah and Bible, devout prophets sang in praise of God Yahweh, \u201cFor us Humans, O God, Thee hath kept a plentiful supply of fish for us to eat in the oceans!\u201d But the same oceans are also full of creatures like human-eating sharks which can eat a human body alive and whole. The oceans are also teeming with other forms of sea life like poisonous snakes, sting rays, electric rays and the Portuguese-Man-of-war which can either kill, maim or in any other way seriously harm any human form in sea-water \u2013 a swimmer or diver, a shipwrecked sailor, a fisherman, marine biologist or oceanologist \u2013 the ocean Gods are quite busy nurturing these forms of life harmful to man with sustained impartiality. Quite similar to a mugger who first poses as a traveler\u2019s guide, then waits for an opportune time to shed his mask to finally loot his trusting quarry in the middle of nowhere, the ocean, while carrying afloat thousands of rafts, boats and vessels at a time, suddenly throws some of them off its back and into its terrible jaws to swallow up entire vessels and ocean liners like the doomed Titanic, drowning all the thousands of people aboard in one gulp. Oceans can unpredictably erupt into tsunamis sucking entire populations of coastal settlements into their watery graves.\u00a0\nRivers in Africa, Australia and South America are full of potentially human-eating creatures like alligators, piranha and crocodiles. The holy rivers, on whose banks civilizations and cities flourished, can swallow up entire townships or at least several thousand helpless people and animals in one spate, be they the Holy Mother Ganges or Jamnaji, the Brahmaputra, Hwang-Ho or Nile, the Holy Jordan or the Father Thames.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Primitive Semitic devotion believed in the Abrahamic Books that the Elohim (Yahweh of the Bible and Allah of the Quran) created the goat, lamb, deer and other creatures so that his believers would get lots of meat to eat! But the devotion with which the believer smacks his lips on seeing \u201cfood\u201d animals blinds him to the obvious fact that the same world in which he resides with his \u201cfood\u201d animals is also home to potentially man-eating animals like the big wild cats, crocodiles, bears and sharks. If a man-eating Sunderban Royal Bengal tiger preys on an unsuspecting human child and is spotted smacking his lips after devouring the child\u2019s flesh, should we say that God created small human children with tender flesh just so that some man-eater can have a delicious meal? And as if to provide icing on a cake, the world has its share of dangerous vegetarian beasts as well, from the very herbivorous African river hippos that can cut a human form into two in one snap of their jaws (just as easily as we crunch a slice of cucumber at our dinner table), to the grass-munching land giants like the bison or Assamese rhinos and ultimately the largest land mammal, the\u00a0 solitary bull African elephants all of whom are known to kill humans more often than do the carnivorous big cats. \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0When a tsunami strikes a coast, it sucks in everything it can from coastal human inhabitation- brides in their own wedding ceremonies about to garland their grooms, mothers suckling their meek hungry and vulnerable infants, artists with unfinished paintings and sculptures, lovers locked mid-ardor oblivious to the world, devotees in mid-meditation with spiritual ecstasy\u2026 entire cities like Dwarika and Atlantis, regions and subcontinents have gone under water, got buried under volcanic lava like Pompeii\u2026 as quickly as Ganesh devotees immerse a Ganesh idol in the sea \u2013 with cataclysmic precision. And yet, the next daybreak, the same Dawn Goddess Usha, who was soulfully venerated with sacred chants of the Vedas, appears as pink as always over the destruction.\u00a0\nThe Quran quotes that Allah created the moon so that the believer could tell the parts of the day to know when to offer namaz. But when the \u201cinfidel\u2019 Chengiz Khan stormed Baghdad, the cultural capital of Islamdom, massacring all Momins in his wake, slaughtering clerics and the Caliph with his family, demolishing the whole city, razing all buildings and walking over a pile of cut heads of killed Muslims, did not the moon still rise over the same Baghdad that night too, informing the namaz-hating Chengiz Khan about the times of the day just as it did the namaz-performing Muslims?\u00a0\n\nFragrant flowers, melodiously singing songbirds, the haughty peacock with his inimitable plumage, even entire forests get roasted alive in a single bushfire or forest fire, like we roast a brinjal on a flame. \nWhile a human population trustingly plays the game of life in the daytime and rests secure every night in the lap of Mother Earth, some particular moment the same terra firma demolishes the unsuspecting population with one earthquake tremor \u2013 buildings get flattened, both huts and architecturally marvelous monuments of human creativity and civilisation, like a pack of cards ceases to exist. Entire villages can be swallowed alive in a moment with the same earth opening up a giant crevice in an earthquake!\u00a0\nHistorically giant meteors have hit the earth and in some cases, even set in massive cycles of climatic change and destruction with extinctions of entire species. Can a flaming comet also not suddenly appear out of the blue (from outer space) and hit the surface of the earth setting ablaze entire regions much like a flaming torch can set ablaze a whole pile of cotton?\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For every lifestyle there exists a dysfunction. The human body, when diseased, is a museum of pathologies and pain- furuncles, epilepsy, tumours, agony, coma, palpitations, diabetes and heart arrests\u2026 The world out there has its rounds of bubonic plagues, famines, cholera epidemics \u2026\u00a0\nOur faith and belief that humankind is the centre of reference for the whole universe and that not just\u00a0our own\u00a0planet - the earth with her plentiful resources and life forms - but the whole\u00a0cosmos\u00a0was created by God\u00a0only\u00a0for humankind,\u00a0only\u00a0to favour humankind,\u00a0only\u00a0to provide pleasure to humankind and\u00a0only\u00a0out of special partisan fondness for humankind, eventually crystallized into belief systems, some open to contrary thought and other times closed to alternative view-points, like unbending dogma unwilling to confront rationalism. We humans even created religious texts of this dogma, selectively only documenting phenomena supportive of our theory that God first manufactures and then employs even stars, planets, comets, black holes, galaxies and constellations exclusively for sustaining human existence, protecting human life, providing fun, pleasure and entertainment to humans and eternally providing resources to human civilization, happiness and prosperity. This blinkered approach has only blinded us to stark, obvious natural phenomena and unpleasant observations of accidents and natural catastrophes endured by humankind that contradict our doctrine of \u201cGod\u2019s Creation for human welfare\u201d. We have to free ourselves of the shackles of this dogmatic conditioning to outgrow our primary assumption and adopt the approach of unbiased reasoning and dispassionate analysis to explain observations both pleasant and unpleasant.\u00a0\n\nFaith in this God-of-man theory can best be treated as a development of the primitive emotional human mind at its most innocent, childlike, seeking state. Faith created scripture - we can even marvel at the poetic expressions and emotional inputs that created some devotional scripture. We can pragmatically and patiently hear out, even study with interest all religious, devotional and ritualistic versions of the same God-of-man belief across the world as necessary stepping stones in the evolution of the human mind. Not all scriptures are unbending dogma. Some scriptures and cultures like the Indic (Bhakti-Vedantic, Buddhistic and Jain), Greek, Egyptian (Pre-Arian and Arian) and Far Eastern (Taoist, Confucian, Shinto) showed a readiness to discuss alternate viewpoints freely, while other types of scriptures like the Bible and Quran show the otherwise seeking human mind trapped at some primitive stage of thought not amenable to reasoning, with self-imposed fossilization, in the evolution of human thought processes.\nIt is\u00a0completely beyond\u00a0human reasoning powers to deduce the real intention due to which or without which this cosmos came into existence even with the best of telescopes, space exploration technology, knowledge of physics and mathematics \u2013 or with the most insightful of meditative techniques. We can only reason this much \u2013 the world and cosmos are not specially created for man; man matters little to other space bodies, whatever our earthly human thoughts - theist or atheist, scientific or devotional. We humans are only as significant in the big universe as may be some other creature- some worm, germ, bug or bee. In other words, humans are no more than a very ordinary, temporary production in the eternal flow of time and the incessant dynamics of the universe.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Thus, crops do not grow, fruits do not ripen or spices are not delicious so that humankind should be fed good food. Crops grow, hence humans can eat them \u2013 that\u2019s all. Rivers do not flow because humankind needs water- on the contrary; we happen to get water because rivers flow. Even when it was the age of the dinosaurs before the evolution of modern humans, rivers had been flowing, flowers were blooming, the stars were twinkling \u2013 just as they do so now! Even when the earth was under the grip of the ice age, or even before the very birth of earth, this very own home planet - the sun had its cosmic motion unfazed by anything else. Why, even if this very\u00a0sun\u00a0or our very own Milky Way were to vanish, the rest of the cosmos would be probably as affected as the luminosity of daylight is affected by the death of a firefly. Such an unfazed, unperturbed cosmic power that would not elicit even a moment\u2019s mourning by the sudden nemesis of a hundred suns or solar systems even on a daily basis\u00a0can\u00a0still be venerated as \u201cGod\u201d (to satiate human spiritual hunger) but slightly differently - as the \u201cGod of the universe\u201d - certainly not as our older conception of \u201cGod of Humankind\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If our \u201cGod of Humankind\u201d would\u00a0not\u00a0have provided even\u00a0elementary\u00a0aids of survival, some minimal resources to exploit or primitive conditions of protection from the wild side of nature, could anyone or anything have stopped Him from disallowing any human existence? Yet, the human race\u00a0did\u00a0get access to natural bounty as comprehended by our five elementary human senses,\u00a0could\u00a0exploit resources and\u00a0could\u00a0modify circumstances to make quite a few habitats hospitable to human survival.\u00a0 Not only did humans survive, they prospered into civilizations. They did not just get a world, they got a rich earth, with rivers of water, edible foods, and useful animals \u2013 with fragrant flowers, scenic beauty and melodiously singing birds added in to enliven existence. The human race has eventually flourished so far, certainly not perished!\nYet, this appearance of human life on earth, juxtaposed in the evolutionary history of the earth, itself juxtaposed in the eternal universal upheaval of creation, sustenance and destruction, is no more than a speck in time, a temporary, ordinary and miniscule event not worth reckoning in the largely unknown, unfathomable history of the universe. Whatever dependability nature has shown with whatever few conditions encouraging human existence on this planet earth, are\u00a0merely a coincidence. So long as this coincidence lasts, so long as we survive as humans, we humans can term this coincidence, this favorable set of circumstances, the \u201cGod of Humankind\u201d; we can even offer Him a flower out of devotion and gratitude. To this, and only to this limited extent, can we condescend to say that the \u201cGod of Humankind\u201d is kind to, partial towards and protective of his human \u201cchildren\u201d.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Mentally envisaging the \u201cGod of the universe\u201d is merely going logically further in our God-conceptualization exercise. There are two techniques, scientific and spiritual, essentially complementary to each other. Scientifically, we have space shuttles and telescopes augmenting the eye, to note birth of stars or their celestial burial in black holes. Spiritually, ancients reached yogic contemplative planes like Saptapatal, Brahmalok, Vishnulok, Devalok, etc. through meditation augmenting the inner mind. Either way, the universe (or the \u201cGod\u201d of the universe) is uninfluenced by prayers, unperturbed by human emotions, unaffected by human birth or death, prosperity or tragedy, too abstract to be affected by anything, partial towards no one, certainly not humans, is equally responsible for both genesis and nemesis. Neither does this power purposefully bless us, nor purposefully punish us. This \u201cGod of the universe\u201d is too subtle and omnipotent to be a personality like a jealous Old Testament Yahweh who vindictively resorts to curses against and punishments like sending locusts and frogs against bonded followers trespassing into worshipping alternate God-forms.\u00a0 The power of the \u201cGod of the universe\u201d is also not thanks to some seat or tag of authority, like is the case of the celestial Indra (whose power being not his own but by virtue of the\u00a0throne\u00a0of the \u201cruler of heaven-residing deities\u201d), who insecurely presupposes that anyone engrossed in meditation, sage or demon alike, can get strong enough to usurp his throne and depose him. The \u201cGod of the universe\u201d requires no medium like angrily foaming prophets whose careers were nothing more than haranguing people into remaining bonded to the Old Testament books of dogma by issuing dire warnings, or mysterious secretive shamanic witch-doctors sacrificing poor animals to entities like demons and spirits in occult rituals while mumbling to themselves in a state of mind bordering on epilepsy, creating a whole plethora of lesser Gods, demi-Gods and other entities taking their toll tax from a seeker on a spiritual quest on the way towards the real God unluckily trespassing onto their domain of esoteric teritory. The God of the universe could freely be \u201cHe\u201d, \u201cShe\u201d, even \u201cIt\u201d - we don\u2019t know, we can call this force what we want.\n\nConceptualising God of this nature requires not just intellectual effort but also spiritual courage. We now have a God to bow before but we must learn to take care of ourselves in individual and collective crises in life within the framework of natural laws,\u00a0praakrutik dharma. If one is the captain of a sinking ship, one should use all knowledge in navigation and ship mechanics to save the ship, passengers and cargo first \u2013 all prayers to the God of the ship or the God of the Seas or the God of humankind are only\u00a0after\u00a0all realistic efforts are instituted. Like vitamin B complex helping the main medicine fight an illness, rather than becoming the medicine itself denying other specific medicines the credit of working. Thus the God of humankind is nothing other than one side, namely the bright, congenial side - the feel-good factor - of the God of the Universe. Whether the devotionally conceived God of Humankind partial to humankind or the intellectually conceptualized God of the Universe partial towards no one, we can treat every conception with respect, since we term the conception \u201cGod\u201d. Particularly when we have first respected the \u201cGod of humankind\u201d and then pulled Him into the morass of half-baked notions of devotion, the \u201cGod of the universe\u201d deserves greater respect.\nWe first invested the conception of the God of humankind with human emotions and personalities, good and bad traits, then invoked Him (or Her) to account for each and every positive or negative personal event and gradually, pulled down Divinity into the mud, demoted the stature of our conception of \u201cdivinity\u201d into an entity that serves our selfish interests and base desires by ordinary bribes of prayer. The bigger our personal desire, the more flamboyant or expectant our prayer gets - the \u201cGod of Humankind\u201d would do us good if we conduct some sacrificial rite, organize a Satyanarayana Pooja, attend successive masses of Novena or repeatedly visit a fakir\u2019s mausoleum. Imagining any covenant with the \u201cGod of Humankind\u201d simply ties us up in illogical knots - if we offer prayers of gratitude to God for saving us from danger, then who presented us with these dangers in the first place? The same \u201cGod\u201d! First He slits our neck and then He heals it. If we should worship Him for healing us, should we also not full-fledgedly blame Him first for hurting us? It is like the story of two roadside beggars fighting amongst each other saying, \u201cI am right, you are wrong\u201d and desperately but unsuccessfully trying to get the judgment of superiority from an emperor whose retinue passing momentarily by their way \u2013 the emperor does not even notice, the convoy passes ahead and the two beggars go back to wrestling each other in the muck. Well, invoking the \u201cGod of Humankind\u201d for these twin emotional outbursts of blaming and thanking, for every worthless and inconsequential event of life, is worse than the fight of these two roadside beggars. The age and limits of our universe are too big to even be measured - human devotional tantrums do not matter at all.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0What is\u00a0rational\u00a0is that we can study, infer, discover, analyse, comprehend, teach each other and then recode for posterity the\u00a0laws\u00a0by which the universe and its components exist, govern themselves and act or interact. We can then try and align ourselves with the laws of the functioning of nature and the universe in ways beneficial to the human race, conducive to our survival. This is the only thing possible for us humans. Thus any act, behaviour or conduct of a human being conducive and helpful to the survival of the whole human race and to our habitat (the earth and \u201cher\u201d environment) in the long term is\u00a0good, ethical and correct\u00a0behaviour. On the contrary, any thought or conduct that can make us perish or destroy our own habitat, anything that can adversely affect human survival or can be a deterrent to long-term human survival of our human habitat is\u00a0bad, unethical and incorrect\u00a0behaviour. This definition of human ethics is workable, rational and clear to understand. But beliefs like \u201cWhat \u2018God\u2019 likes is ethical\u201d and \u201cThat which is helpful to Humans is liked by God\u201d are untrue and untenable, in fact too childish to sustain. We need to realize that we are part of the universe, but the universe is not ours or ruled by us. To a negligible extent the universe favours us. To a much greater extent, the universe is unfavourable to us. Accepting this truth clearly, bravely and unhesitatingly is being both human and humane. And this is the true religion of the entire human race, the true worship of the \u201cGod of the universe\u201d.", "HiRez Studios just released Rama as their newest god in their free to play MOBA Smite.

I mean, as I learnt recently by playing some betting card game, a bet needs to be matched. So, If I bet Rs. 1000 it needs to be matched by Rs. 1000 from your side too. \n\nNow, the fun question is, did Duryodhan match Yudishthir's bet of Draupadi by betting something from his own side? Because otherwise, the game shouldn't continue. A betting game in which I bet Rs. 100 and you get it if you win and I just save it by winning is not fair.\n\nSo, what was the betting structure of the dice game in Mahabharata?", "The essence of Mahabharat (Ready to discuss)What is the Dharm which Krishn has emphasized so much in Mahabharat. For one definition we know Dharm means righteousness. If Krishn's Dharm means righteousness then what does he mean by righteousness. Is it the righteousness of action, or the results? In the Mahabharat Kaurav took the land and exiled Pandav. Kaurav basically symbolize a behaviour which is to be considered as bad and many a times abhorrent. Not respecting the women, confiscating properties, later refusing to return what's not theirs, breaking laws, not being Just despite being the rulers, trying to kill their family members and many more thing I might not be aware of. This is to be punished and maybe this is what Krishna means. Maybe justice is the idea of Krishn's version of Dharm.   My primary argument was that Krishna did many of the acts which can be associated with trickery, deceit and slyness. But he did everything to bring justice. He's like the one of the most Griffindors in the Griffindor house, break the rules to do good. Like Harry, Hermione and Ron would break the rules to to do good here Krishna is doing just the same. The good should rule not matter the means.  The major antagonist in the story is Duryodhan, he is the source of all the conflict and rest of the characters in Kaurav's side revolve around the whims and wishes of this character. If this person was eliminated from the story the basis of whole Mahabharat would collapse. Naturally Dhritrastr would return the land and Kingdom to the Pandav brothers, may even the whole kingdom.   So, Duryodhan is the biggest plot point of the story. But there's one more plot point which is as much important. And it is  Kurn. Despite Krishna's knowledge that he was son of Kunti he did not allow Kurn to participate in Draupadi's Swayamvar for the obvious reasons that Krishn wanted Draupadi to marry Arjun and not Kurn. Why would Krishn do that? Krishn being a god knew the future can was well aware about the war. He was who took it to the level of war. Had he wanted he'd have killed Duryodhan long back during Draupadi cheerharan and punished Pandav brothers to use Draupadi in the game, all in the name of Dharm.  The point is, if you are an omniscient being where you could do anything, you are the one who is running the game. The war was not a result of one but a number of incidents, of which the omniscient being was part of many. It is not wrong to say that the war was Krishn's will.  But why? Answer is maybe the whole point of designing the situations which would lead to war is to set an example. The example to show the world that in the way of being righteous even if you have to kill your family members it's the right thing to do.", "What is Hinduism iSo what I learned in school about Hinduism is basically reincarnation and they believe in lots of gods also they cant eat meat. Ok sounds like your average wack ass religion.\n\nWell ive also heard that this is a total misrepresentation of Hinduism. And that really what its about is the belief we are just actors playing the game existence. Life is a celebration and all the different gods are not so literal and more of a metaphor.\n\nSo what really is Hinduism ?

This is going to be an extremely long post, but I ask to any of you that have knowledge regarding my ambitions and goals, to please chime in with a response. If you can't personally answer some of my questions, but you do know people that can, I ask that you show this to them, so I can be guided. This is the last step for me I feel personally, for now. I know there is always more, and I know I can always learn more, but for right now in my life, this is the step I need to take, and you'll see what I mean. Btw, if you don't want to read my backstory, just skip to the bottom. I don't suggest it though, because I have the feeling that someone is supposed to read this, and this is all meant to be happening for a reason.\n\n\nOkay, my first step in this post is going to be describing to you a brief td;lr of my life, and then a more detailed explanation of what's been happening to me for the past 3 or so weeks.\n\nOkay, for the TD;LR of my life:\nParents were always strict Christians, but I denied it all my life and followed my instincts, trying things, studying, meditating, praying, ext. I was always insanely interested in knowledge, history in specific, and spirituality even more.\n\nI've spent the last 2 - 3 or so years (I'm 18 years old as of writing this), I've been focusing on spirituality in a very hardcore manner (even more serious than everything from before combined), studying constantly, spending all my time either meditating or studying. I've studied Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Taoism, and many Nordic beliefs, and finally Satanism (not Christian's version. There's a form of Satanism that has nothing to do with Christianity, and teaches similar ideas to Hinduism. I thought that was it for me, because it preached about you growing your own soul through meditation, yoga, using energy to open your soul, see into the Psychic realm (non-human beings), open your chakras and to unite the female and male sides of your soul, with the ultimate goal being raising your Kundalini serpent past the last chakra and achieving Godhood yourself. I know what I was doing 100% had some effect, but in the end I realized it was only an illusion too, with only hints of truth to distract you from the truth. I came to peace with that, and it took me a very, very, very long time to do that completely.\n\n\nWARNING: In this next section I am going to explain my experiences over the last three weeks, and how it has changed me into a different man, along with some general backround knowledge. During these three weeks ONLY, I was basically under the influence of Marijuana, but I would like to remind all of you, that mind altering substances have been used as a helping hand in spiritual growth for millennia, including Hinduism. I have no further desire for the substance, and will never touch it again. However, I do not regret doing it. Because of my choices, here I am today, and I regard these three weeks as an experience given to me by a higher power, and I'd like to explain that.\n\nA lot of symbolic things happened that has relevance to Hinduism. For example, the entire three weeks, I would play Overwatch, meditate, and sleep. I ate maybe four or five times the entire three weeks (not because of the fact that I thought I had to starve myself, I just genuinely didn't need to). I felt a strong draw to my PS4 specifically, not for the game, not for the console, but for use as a conduit in ways. I look at it, and yes, it appears to be a PS4, but I can see so much more on the flip-side. It is a tool to connect you to people and to compete. During these 3 weeks, I would play Zenyatta on Overwatch to represent myself going through a spiritual journey, and as I would take the next steps in this journey, I would become better at playing him. And then I started to think, maybe me playing Overwatch on my PS4 is proving my skill on another level of existance? Or triggering something in the future, past, or in a parallel reality?\n Because I didn't play Overwatch in a traditional sense. I used my emotions to fuel my skill. It was like I was using my mind to control the controller directly, no longer needing to use my body to move, just dictating my body commands from a different perspective. What I would do was force myself to feel a specific way, depending on what the scenario needed. If we were losing a checkpoint, I would fuel all of the rage inside of me into defending it, always focusing on the objective. And I would destroy. Imagining past battles in history, imagining the pain that people had to deal with, everything. I channeled whatever feeling the situation needed into the situation.\n\nI started to get noticed, and then something weird started happening that marked the start of this long 3 week journey. I was in Quick Play, and I was talking to this boy, maybe 14, or 15 years old? And he bore a striking resemblance to me when I was younger. For the entire journey after meeting him, almost every single game I would play in Overwatch, would have him in it, without me inviting him, having him as a friend, or anything. Just random matches, but always the same person under a different name. I even ran into him on the PC edition of the game. Remember earlier when I said symbolism with the beliefs of Hinduism? It's like the same scenario with Shiva. You revere Shiva as the only God, but there are many others that lead to him, and just like that system of beliefs, I always ran into this boy.\n\n\nSo I thought to myself, he has to be my guide, right? This has to be it.\nI started meditating on it and was thinking about it, and came to the conclusion (I was a Satanist at the time as described earlier) that Satan was trying to guide me towards a path of enlightening the world, a path in which everyone would leave material desires behind and embracing a life of peace and true wisdom. But over the three weeks, I realized, there was no such thing happening (not in the way I thought anyways) ~~ I meditated for nearly 12 hours a day, ate only 4 or 5 times total the entire 3 weeks, and had absolutely no short term memory. There were days were I was so disconnected from myself, that I didn't even know who I was or what I was, moving like a robot with no goals, nothing. It became hard to exist, hard to think, hard to speak, hard to interact with the world. I was in seclusion for weeks, and it was almost like controlling my body from a higher point of view. Like in a RTS game, controlling an entire squad at once for example. I felt like one of the soldiers ready to die for the cause. Coming to peace with everything took awhile, but I came to the point where I left the world behind completely in my own mind, and I was ready to start a new life with a new name and complete this journey. I gave many tests to this spiritual force, and many things did happen. I realized now it had not been Satan guiding me, but something else. And then I looked into Hinduism out of nowhere (it popped into my head randomly) and saw how Shiva is regarded. And I did further research and discovered the belief that all different paths all lead to the same thing. And there was SOOOO much Symbolism in those three weeks happening with the exact same idea. And I gained the ability (limited at this point in the story) to see (not really with my eyes, kind of like a mental awakening) more truly than ever before. I look at my monitor now, and don't see a TV exactly, I see that it can be many things, and be used for many things. While I was on this spiritual journey, I noticed also that there was a full moon every night. I didn't realize it at first, but I counted at least 6 days where there were full moons (which is impossible?). I would sleep during the day and wake up at night, meditate, meditate, and hone my hand eye coordination with Overwatch (right now I have basically aimbot level skill with Zenyatta). I used Overwatch as a tool to dig up my deepest feelings basically in a sense (the feelings I had suppressed when I was very young). When I would get killed, I would be furious, and then I would try to amplify that feeling, and try to come back and get revenge, and it worked a few times, but then it just made me worse and worse in skill. And I realized at that moment, that I had to come to peace with myself, that I needed to live life not driven by greed or selfish desires. So I meditated, and I asked myself, why does it make you bad? And I figured out something I never thought I would. While meditating, I started to see things clearly, with distractions pushed to the side. I realized I wanted to not only be important, but I wanted to serve, and bring peace to the world in any way I could. And I was angry because I was suppressing that, not knowing what I wanted to do with my life at all, going from job to job not happy. Even now, I still dream of a world where people can leave greed aside and focus on the spiritual truths of life, living a simplistic yet rewarding life. But then, this triggered an even deeper awakening of my mind, and I started to see the duality in every action of life, every decision. I started to realize things, and see deep on levels I never thought possible. Let's say you walk to the fridge with the goal of getting some water, but then you decide you don't want water in the end? What happens to that thought? What happens to that possibility, that alternate choice? I believe in the principle of duality ~ harmony and chaos. But I also believe there is a middle ground beyond harmony and chaos, a grey zone. What if I could experience all of the possibilities in my previous example? What if with all of those lost memories, forgotten in time, there is a way to bring it back and experience it, to keep it as part of you and to grow from it, to let it guide you? Have you ever thought about ancient humanity, the day to day life of people, their rituals, their way of life. I have, and I wish I could learn everything, and be a voice that continues the traditions going.\n\nI'm someone that desires knowledge more than anything, particularly about spirituality. I devoted my life to nothing but the study of truth long ago, and that's what led me here today. I do believe in the principle of duality, but I also do believe in an even greater state of being. A combination of chaos and peace, using it for each situation as a guide. It may not be possible in this life, but my goal is to learn everything, simply put. I want to know everything about everything, no matter the cost to me, physically, mentally, or spiritually. Everything I've been through has left me with a burning passion that is more powerful than any obstacle. I say now that I will learn everything, and I will defy what I know, because think about it. In this situation, you can choose the middle ground, but there are instances I believe in which you can change what the middle ground actually is, incorporating duality itself into the middle ground that Buddha spoke about. And I believe this is one of those scenarios. Yes, I can choose to know everything, yes, I can choose to know nothing. But what if I want to know everything, and nothing at the same time? To look at existence itself from a 3rd party view, to see it all, be able to experience it, to experience time out of sequence, to be able to relive everything like watching a recorded movie. What if I want to spiritually grow and go past levels of existence even comprehendable by myself (and trust me, I can comprehend a lot of stuff) ~~ But still remember moments like this that defined that journey? Me writing this post, my dog laying on my couch, it being nice and sunny outside but not too hot, and to be able to incorporate even simple memories like this, and experience true knowledge, wisdom, logic, into teachings, in order to expand the minds of others?\n\nWhat I desire the most, is to be a servant to truth itself. Making it be known, all illusions aside. To lift the veil that's been cursing humanity for many, many years.\n\nI realize this sounds weird, but I have the feeling that Shiva was guiding me in one way or another, because there were a lot of things that happened during this journey. While I thought it was Satan guiding me, at least I knew it was something, and now I realize it could have been Shiva in a different form. There were many days were I felt dead inside during these three weeks. I renounced everything and left it behind, trying to take the path of complete peace and abandon chaos. I realize now, that it's impossible. For peace to exist, there must be struggle. It's all part of the journey. It was very painful, not clinging to emotions, leaving everything behind. I felt like a robot, with no purpose. And then my memory started to go down the drain, and it came to the point were I had no memory, I had no identity, I had nothing. I realized then when I left everything behind that I was clinging onto delusions, and I had to take the middle path, as there cannot be life without death, on any level of existence. I thought I had to die physically. I'd convinced myself, I'd lay down in my bed, go to sleep, and whatever God existed would make it so I would wake up in another life. I talked in my head with someone and said, will I die tonight when I go to sleep? And that person said \"Yes, but not in the way you expect.\" I could see him too, in a way. Like... A picture hidden behind a veil. He honestly looked like Gandhi, minus the glasses and a bit younger looking than photographs online show, and standing straight up. I woke up the next day and thought of it all as fake and said forget life and gave up. And my mind crumbled into Chaos. I knew at the time my spiritual beliefs were a deception, and I said I'm finally done living. I got to the point where I accepted death, embraced the feelings of nothingness and savored it, almost getting turned on in a sadistic way by the thoughts of the many ways I could die. But then when it never happened, it triggered something in me that not only destroyed me physically, mentally, and spiritually, it awakened me, and I rebuilt from the rubble of my old weak mind. There was a point where there was nothing. And I meditated, because I wanted to feel something. Then I came to the conclusion I didn't need to die, and I wasn't going to yet. Before, I thought my purpose was to die, be reincarnated into a new life, and save the world spiritually in a sense (true Satanists believe in reincarnation also) ~ but then I realized, the goal was never to die physically. Through this entire journey, something was guiding me, telling me exactly what to do, what to say, what to feel. I felt like a slave, trapped in a body, wanting to move on. And then I meditated, and I thought about my suffering, and thought about why I wanted to die so bad truly, and then the illusions started slipping away, and peace started to come back. And in that instant, it was like that previous life of mine had been destroyed, and I finally found my way to the middle path. It triggered a feeling in me of death on all levels, including mentally. I thought I was completely dead on every level, but then I started to meditate, and think, and use my experiences in the past as a guide, like putting together a puzzle. I realized, what I wanted to do with my life was truly dedicate myself to my study, and to help spread knowledge and wisdom. I wanted to be the black sheep that would take all of the pain, and show everyone the true way, the \"easy\" way. But then I realized the duality with my next awakening. Ignorance is a bliss, and the path of knowledge is not for everyone, and I realized then that there was no \"easy\" way. I realized that yes, I've been through a journey all of my life, but so has everyone else, and so will everyone else. And while I may be able to guide people the right direction, it will be on them to find peace within themselves. No God, no person, nobody can do it but themselves, because I realized that you have to WANT the truth, to SEE the truth. I would like to emphasize with everyone here, I have an insanely strong mind in a spiritual and mental sense. When I was a child, I was tormented by insomnia and \"evil thoughts\" and had terrible thoughts in my head when I would try to go to sleep, and one day I decided the only way I would be happy was to destroy it. So I stopped thinking. After a few weeks, it became natural, and to this day, I still have a clear head, with not a thought going through it. But, through those three weeks? It was the opposite, and I experienced for the entire three weeks the suffering and chaos I had suppressed. And after all of the mental rubble and debris got cleaned up, I came out stronger than ever before.\n\nREAD THIS: I thought this important to denote, I was instantly drawn specifically to Shaivism when researching about Hinduism. And looking now on Wikipedia, it seems many of the things and experiences I've been through aligns perfectly with what Shaivites beleive. Throughout this entire post, I'm sure there are many methods of thinking that sync up to Shaivism beleifs. This leads to a further question below that I honestly want you guys to take seriously.\n\nEverything I've been through paints a clear picture, but honestly I just need guidance on two things.\n\n\nACTUAL QUESTIONS:\n\nHow can I devote myself to my study and start on this lifelong journey? I live in the USA, and I'm German, and I know it's probably unheard of someone coming to this path of life, from where I come from, but I would like to move to India and renounce my past life eventually. I want to know what I can do to get started on my journey, because honestly, I'm out of clues. I will do research and continue to grow, but advice would be appreciated. You can't exactly google how to move to India and join a group of people (I'll give an example, the Hindu equivalent of becoming a Buddhist monk and devoting himself to his studies, living in a temple) ~ I have done a little bit of research and I know it's possible, so I would like to skip the Second Ashrama and choose the path of becoming a Sannyasa, no matter how long it takes. I know I'm 18 years old, but I feel that this is my true calling. And I feel once I reach that point, I can go even further than that. At the moment, I don't know too much about Hinduism in a deep sense, so I'm going to do a lot more research, and start living a lifestyle of a Shaivite specifically to prepare myself (as this is the system of beliefs that I align with absolutely 100% without a doubt, and it just feels right to me naturally). But if you guys understand what I desire, and you know anything that can help me on my journey, I would so appreciate any knowledge.\n\n2nd question, is it possible that I am a reincarnation of some type of philosopher? The only reason I ask this is because I'm drawn very strongly not only to Shaivism, but to the Dharma, to the truths of life, and to the dualities of life. It's like... I'm being guided by memories I can't remember, but they're still influencing me and helping me grow, and slowly unlocking more and more of my mind.\n\n\n\nAnnnd that's it\nIf you read all of this, thanks a lot. I ask anyone that reads all of this and has knowledge that could help me, to give a response. I also ask that you take your time to write it and really try to help me out. I know, this is all a lot to take in and respond to, but can't you see my passion? It won't be a waste of time putting your heart into a response, because I am devoted now to this.\n\nThank you, everyone! \nSorry for the INSANELY long post, by the way.

I have been interested in meditation and spirituality since I was an early teen.  I went to college and graduated despite mental health difficulties.  I then over the last half decade have struggled through 4 or 5 different jobs.  I have never had a successful relationship and though I do desire having a close female partner, it has never been something attainable for me.  I am very sensitive to energy and find that since I became celibate I have continuously become more sensitive.  I feel the negative energy or aggression when someone enters a room. \n____\nI think I want to become a monk because the worldly life doesn't seem to have anything to offer me anymore.  I value the comforts of my home/money, but honestly I was making six figures and I wasn't happy at all.  The only time I am happy is when I am sitting at a temple meditating.  \n\nI am so tired of the dominance games in society..I don't think there is a place for me there.  \n\nIs there a place I can go to try being a monk for some time?\nHow do I know that being a monk is the right step?", "Kashmir Saivaism?so whats the difference between regular Shiva worhip and this kashmir one?", "Need help with a project I'm working onI'm a freshman in college and for my lit 200 class, I needed to choose an over arching theme based on which i write all my papers throughout the semester. I decided to choose Hinduism because its something I knew very little about, but I am so glad I did. I wort a paper on the mutation of the Swastika and now I have to pick my second research topic. I was thinking about looking at doing one on Yoga as a form of alternative medicine, but my professor said I should reconsider. Anything is fair game as long as it even distinctly relates to Hinduism.\n\nWhat are some interesting research topics I can look at?  ", "On Disrobing of DraupadiI recently finished Jaya by Devdutt Pattnaik and I loved his interpretation after being exposed to a very biased and simplified good vs. Evil story in the TV series I grew up watching as a kid almost 20 years ago. \n\nThe thing that bugged me the most and the book kinda passes over is the inaction of Bheeshma when Draupadi was being disrobed by Dusshasana. Dritharaashtra, I feel, more than the love for his son remained mute because he had essentially no power over his sons. But surely the pitamagan could have stopped this incident and in effect kept the escalation between the cousins in check. Doing so would have meant no war if you think about it. Is there an explanation of this somewhere?\n\nAlso shout out to Karna, he has become my favorite character from the epic.", "How did the Cheras(Keralaputras) compete with the Hindu reinforced Cholas(Tamil Brahmins)?did they loose or win?Some Conclusions for your debate.As we know the Chera Chola complex defined the destiny in the subcontinent in an ancient period. What was beyond the Vindhyas was defined by Indo European migrations( First by the primary Indo Europeans - Originators of contemporary Hinduism) and later followed by Kushans, Scythians and others. However, One would assume that these movements were of noo consequence to the Southerners for a very long period of time.I would like to discuss about this era.However, after a period of Indo European expansion, Hindi Sanskrit IE influence starting streaming down South, where Southern Chieftans took sides and assistance in a game of one-upmanship.\n\nSo, basically we have two Proto Dravidian Kingly lines, possibly from the same families who rule the West(Cheras, now Kerala) and East(Cholas, Chennai, or Tamil Nadu). It is interesting to note that the Cholas took Brahminical help when it came to Metaphysics, especially the Shiva -Vishnu combine(Hari Hara), their Children and extended families for a small example. Its well known that Raja Raja Chola became a Hindu inspired by a Hindu priest( Elite migration into the protected South?) and went on to build huge monuments, usually at the expense of the Tamil locals becoming stone labourers. \n\nIts also interesting to note that the Chera Kings  discouraged Hinduism(Swadharma System- propogated in the Gita or Vedic Varnshrama). They had preferred the Assyrians , and Babylonian Traders for Metal Working upgrades and shared Metaphysical Concepts from them.I believe that due to this reason the Hindu epics refer to Kerala Kings as Asuras, who had Shukra(Pleasure instead of Asceticism) for a teacher.\n\nThe Cheras(Asuras in another sense) with Kings such as Mahabali, Ravana(Ra- Sun, Vana - Sky - Basically a Title) were defeated(Or Land Restricted) after a long Hindu campaign over thousands of years.This involved military activity(Parashuram), population tactics(Vishnu Vamana as the Dwarf Brahmin), Krishna vs Kamsa(Note Kamsas real father was a Rakshasa), Rama vs Ravana (Whatever might be the reasons).\n\nAnd by the end of the campaigns we see that the real Cheras are displaced by the fake Cheras. We can see the second Chera dynasty having Sanskrit names like  Verma, Rama, Ravi instead of the First Chera Malayala names such as Nedum Cheralathan, Uthiyan etc.However they are not finished yet, we see a particular group of socialists in Kerala seize the Central Heartland (they are a mix of native+west semitic, native Assyrian-Babylonian, Native Arab Children) and the new Chera Kings are forced South into Travancore, Feudal Warriors(Native Chekavars)  Seize Northern Kerala and the Hindu Kings(Zamorin) is restricted to the Extreme North.So, we can see that the First Cheras become feudal landlords for a period of time and then later displace the second Cheras and the first Cheras re-emerge  and Brahminism was eventually banned in recent times and Kerala is a communist state till now with Cow Slaughter not only permissible, but encouraged for meat eating practices, usually along with a serving of fresh toddy. I thought this is debatable.\n\nWhat is your opinion?", "Why am I feeling like this regarding religion?So a bit of background, I grew up in a Hindu family and have been done the usual stuff of celebrating festivals, following tradition etc. I wouldn't say I am militant in religion but I pray (or did anyway till recently) daily. It was the Gayatri Chalisa and Hanuman Chalisa just in case people were curious. I am somebody who is a fan of science, although I'm not exactly smart in it all, and interlink the two to enjoy the best of both.\n\nNow, when things go wrong for me/people I care about, I turned to faith or had the belief it was there for me if I needed it. But since the turn of the year, my luck has been so crap its unreal. I have had several interviews at big companies I've dreamed of and one which strung me along for months and then got turned down for cos I gave too much info in the presentation to them. And that one hurt because that was my number one company (no company does anything similar to them) offering me everything I wanted. I went into a period of serious depression which I have not really come out of I guess, but went on and got more interviews at other top companies. Turned down from all for one reason or another. \n\nWhilst that sounds 'woe is me' tale, it made me think about life more. I realised my parents have been getting shat on for years. My father who's only crime was being too kind to people (brothers and friends) got trampled on by them for their selfish needs and then he ended up having a transplant several years ago (for the record, he never drank or anything so it came from nowhere but stress was the main cause according to doctors). Life can only get better right? No. Nothing has improved in their luck and still getting crap coming in from every direction. What did they do? They pray, they are religious, they help people in need at their expense if they need to. Yet all the people who have been dicks and then some have gone on to be rich and happy knowing they are untouchable now. And as you may have guessed, when my dad was in hospital and since they all acted like they gave a shit. Bunch of fucking hypocrites but I can't do anything but play nice either.\n\nThen you have of course those unfortunate people around the world who are born into absolute poverty. And I'm just thinking when I see some of these guys, especially when I saw with my own eyes, what is the point? What kind of God(s) do this? This is not just, to give people absolutely no chance is a cruel game.\n\nI am not saying I want everything in the world even though it would be nice, but why are there people in the world constantly getting screwed over or have no chance even though they try and do good by people, yet people who seem to do nothing but screw people over get everything?\n\n**Tl:dr - Is there much point in keeping faith when it doesn't seem to make one bit of difference?**\n\n*EDIT: I forgot to add, the reason I still can't fully shake the faith I have left is because of the things I've seen I guess. Without wanting to come across as a psycho if I haven't already, its cos of strange things that have happened to people who I trust with my life and they have no reason to lie. I always look at others 'stories' with a skeptical outlook but when the odd thing happens to me/my family then I'll sit up and notice for a bit.*", "Moon watchingToday, being Karthik Pournami,  is one of the best days to gaze at the moon.

We recently bought some tapestries (really, fabric posters with sequins on them, I'm sure you've seen them) of some deities.  We have a Lord Shiva (meditating), Saraswati, Ganesh, and Laxshmi.\n\nI am wondering if there is an optimal or 'correct' placement for these images in our home.  Right now we have Laxshmi in the hallway as you come in our front door (not facing the door, if you come in our home and walk down the hallway you pass Laxshmi on the right).  Ganesh is in our dining area (which is used more for board games than dining).  Shiva hangs over the sofa where we spend most of our time at home, and it is also where we meditate.  Saraswati is on the wall adjacent to Shiva to the right, near our bookshelf (well, one of them). \n\nNone of the deities face each other, and none faces a door to the outside.

How can I find locals to discuss this with?Just got done reading the book \"On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are\" and I was blown away by the quote below. Looking it up online it's from the [Vendata Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta) has anymore work been done on this? How can an American like me learn more about this locally? I've been Agnostic/Atheist for the past 20+ years and this is the closest thing I have ever found to believing in a \"god\" so I would love to learn more. Sorry for my ignorance, but do the Hindu's have churches or gathering places? Thanks for any info and I hope the below will help someone like it has helped me. \n\nYou can read the book \"On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are\" for free here: https://www.leary.ru/download/watts/Book%20On%20The%20Taboo%20Against%20Knowing%20Who%20You%20Are.pdf\n\nAnd here is the quote from the book that I just loved and turned me onto reading more about the Vendata Philosophy. \n\n\"There was never a time when the world began, because it goes round and round like a circle, and there is no place on a circle where it begins. Look at my watch, which tells the time; it goes round, and so the world repeats itself again and again. But just as the hour-hand of the watch goes up to twelve and down to six, so, too, there is day and night, waking and sleeping, living and dying, summer and winter. You can't have any one of these without the other, because you wouldn't be able to know what black is unless you had seen it side-by-side with white, or white unless side-by-side with black.\n\n\"In the same way, there are times when the world is, and times when it isn't, for if the world went on and on without rest for ever and ever, it would get horribly tired of itself. It comes and it goes. Now you see it; now you don't. So because it doesn't get tired of itself, it always comes back again after it disappears. It's like your breath: it goes in and out, in and out, and if you try to hold it in all the time you feel terrible. It's also like the game of hide-and-seek, because it's always fun to find new ways of hiding, and to seek for someone who doesn't always hide in the same place.\n\n\"God also likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside God, he has no one but himself to play with. But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself. He pretends that he is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, all the plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when he wakes up they will disappear.\n\n\"Now when God plays hide and pretends that he is you and I, he does it so well that it takes him a long time to remember where and how he hid himself. But that's the whole fun of it\u2014just what he wanted to do. He doesn't want to find himself too quickly, for that would spoil the game. That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be himself. But when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will wake up, stop pretending, and remember that we are all one single Self\u2014the God who is all that there is and who lives for ever and ever.\n\n\"Of course, you must remember that God isn't shaped like a person. People have skins and there is always something outside our skins. If there weren't, we wouldn't know the difference between what is inside and outside our bodies. But God has no skin and no shape because there isn't any outside to him. [With a sufficiently intelligent child, I illustrate this with a M\u00f6bius strip\u2014a ring of paper tape twisted once in such a way that it has only one side and one edge.] The inside and the outside of God are the same. And though I have been talking about God as 'he' and not 'she,' God isn't a man or a woman. I didn't say 'it' because we usually say 'it' for things that aren't alive.\n\n\"God is the Self of the world, but you can't see God for the same reason that, without a mirror, you can't see your own eyes, and you certainly can't bite your own teeth or look inside your head. Your self is that cleverly hidden because it is God hiding.\n\n\"You may ask why God sometimes hides in the form of horrible people, or pretends to be people who suffer great disease and pain. Remember, first, that he isn't really doing this to anyone but himself. Remember, too, that in almost all the stories you enjoy there have to be bad people as well as good people, for the thrill of the tale is to find out how the good people will get the better of the bad. It's the same as when we play cards. At the beginning of the game we shuffle them all into a mess, which is like the bad things in the world, but the point of the game is to put the mess into good order, and the one who does it best is the winner. Then we shuffle the cards once more and play again, and so it goes with the world.\"\n\nThis story, obviously mythical in form, is not given as a scientific description of the way things are. Based on the analogies of games and the drama, and using that much worn-out word \"God\" for the Player, the story claims only to be like the way things are. I use it just as astronomers use the image of inflating a black balloon with white spots on it for the galaxies, to explain the expanding universe. But to most children, and many adults, the myth is at once intelligible, simple, and fascinating. By contrast, so many other mythical explanations of the world are crude, tortuous, and unintelligible. But many people think that believing in the unintelligible propositions and symbols of their religions is the test of true faith. \"I believe,\" said Tertullian of Christianity, \"because it is absurd.\"", "Today is Holi, March 6, 2015Holi is a spring festival celebrated on the day of the full moon during the Indian month of *Phalgun*. It indicates the approaching spring equinox.\n\n**Legends**\n\n- [Lord Vishnu protected *Prahalad*, his devotee from the demon Holika as she tries to burn him in in a bonfire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XRTm7J-uEw).

It is said that Lord Shiva was ignorant of Ganapati, who was brought to life as the son of Goddess Parvati. How ignorant is this fabrication! \n\nLord Shiva is said to be the deity of Knowledge (Jnanam Maheswaraat). He is Sarvajna or omniscient. Is such a story not insulting to Lord Shiva, who is the ultimate Lord? \n\nGanapati means the Lord of the devotees of His innermost circle, who are liberated souls. He is the ultimate Lord who comes down to this earth in human form to play with His devotees here. Ignorance is at its maximum on earth and therefore this world is an excellent playground for His divine play or game. \n\nHe comes down along with the devotees belonging to His innermost circle called as Gana (Kridayantam aharnisham\u2014Shankara). This story can be likened to a boy who calls his closest friends to play a game or a person who goes to see and enjoy a cinema along with his family members. \n\nThe ultimate Parabrahman, who descends down in the human form along with His innermost devotees, for the divine play on this earth is Ganapati (Gananaantva\u2014Veda). \n\nWhat is the meaning of the elephant-head? It means the nature of an elephant.\n\nThe head represents the intelligence or Buddhi of an elephant and not the head of the elephant physically. We scold a stupid person and call him a donkey. It means that his inner nature is like that of the donkey and not his physical form.\n\nWhat is the nature of an elephant? It is said \u201cGajaana mati Bhirutvam\u2019, which means that the elephant has enormous strength but it forgets its own strength and is always afraid of everything. Similarly, when the Lord comes down, He imposes ignorance on Himself to enjoy the role. The actor should forget himself in the role if he wants to fully enjoy his character. Therefore, the Lord forgets His divine strength and acts like a Jeeva (soul), fearing the onslaught of troubles in this world.\n\nThe Veda says that fear is a characteristic of the limited soul (Atha tasya Bhayam Bhavati). Only by being fearful can the Lord fully enjoy and also do full justice to the role.\n\nIt is said that Goddess Parvati prepared the body of Ganapati and also introduced life into it. This statement has an inner spiritual meaning. Goddess Parvati represents Maya. When the Lord incarnates in this world, Maya prepares the human body and also introduces life, which is Para Prakriti, into it.\n\nTherefore, life or awareness is only a part of creation and is not Parabrahman. \n\nGanapati also shows five faces like Shiva. This indicates that Parabrahman indicated by the word Shiva has entered the human body. Ganapati is said to be the husband of Siddhi and Buddhi. Siddhi and Buddhi are not two ladies although they are symbolically shown to be so. \n\nBuddhi means knowledge associated with logical analysis. Siddhi means attainment. You have to attain the Lord in human form, who is the Satguru by logical analysis, so that you can eliminate fraud preachers. Siddhi means the attainment of the Lord in human form.\n\nYou should take the inner sense of Lord Ganesha\u2019s story, which alone is the truth.\n\nScholars explain the concept in a symbolic language for the sake of illiterate and ignorant people. \n\nGanapati is said to be very brave, having stood against even Lord Shiva. This means that when the Lord is with full knowledge in His original form, He is fully aware of His divine strength. But when the head of Ganapati is replaced by the head of an elephant, He forgot all his divine strength and was afraid of everything. \n\nThis is a symbolic story. \n\nThe actual meaning is that the Lord in his original form is fully aware of Himself and His power. But when he comes down in human form, He forgets His divine strength and fears like an ordinary soul. This gives full enjoyment to the Lord in the human role. \n\nThe vehicle of the huge Ganapati is a small rat. This means that when you enter the service of the Lord, you need not think about your capacity to serve Him. By the will and power of the Lord, you\u2019ll gain the capability to serve Him. You are just an external instrument and the Lord wants to give you divine fame. \n\nThe small rat carries the huge Ganapati and this is not due to the strength of the rat. It is only by the power of Ganapati that the small rat carries Him.\n\nIf you want to read more, you can find the original text can be found at:\n\nhttps://www.universal-spirituality.org/downloads/DivineDiscourses-3.pdf (page 6 onward)", "Religious groups should embrace video games, not fight themSome religious groups have been opposed to video games in the past due to concerns over violence and themes they believe are contrary to their faith, but this is changing as they begin to understand the power of the medium.

One of the primary reasons is that I can't seem to make close, lasting, fulfilling friendships. I've always been a lonely person and kinda feel like it'll stay that way. I love people, but they don't have time for me. My heart will swell with love for a person, but they're just too busy in their lives to talk or hang out or anything. So I'm left alone at home all the time.\n\nI can't work or drive, I've had someone throw a rock through my window recently (which has made me feel unsafe in my own home and has made me feel too afraid to leave the house alone), and it's generally been a rough patch recently.

I'll typically play it from when I wake up to when I go to sleep (though I still have Bible Time).

It also helps me listen to the Bible better because it gives my eyes something to do. (If I just close my eyes and listen to the Bible, my thoughts tend to distract me and I miss large portions of scripture, whereas I've been listening quite well when playing ACNH in the background. I don't always want to physically read the Bible because I struggle with reading comprehension and have to read the same sentence over and over.) ACNH is also a fairly family-friendly game, so I'm not concerned that the game itself is inherently evil.\n\nI have, however, been feeling very convicted about my gaming habits recently. We've been reading through the book of Hebrews and it hits about half as good as a Paul Washer sermon. I hate myself now, feel like crap, feel like I'm destined for Hell. Very fire and brimstone, and my soul is weary. \n\nI want to make the Lord happy, and I try to go to church twice a week and read my Bible every day, but I suppose that isn't enough. I feel like I have to give up this thing that's bringing me peace in such a hard time. I know it's not as hard as some other people have it, I get that, but it's still hard. \n\nAnd if you're going to tell me that I shouldn't be lonely because Jesus is my friend, I hope you'll also explain *how* to make Jesus my friend, since I can't have an audible conversation with Him. If I ask God whether He thinks the purple dress or the pink dress is cuter, I don't realistically think He is going to respond to me. I need a person to talk to for that.\n\nAlso, if you're going to tell me that the Lord should be the only thing that brings me peace, how does that work? How do you receive the peace? How could I ever be at peace knowing that everything I do is wrong and awful and sinful and I always make the worst choices? Why can't I just be happy?\n\nIf you have any advice on this situation, please do share it.

It features themes  from multiple religions, but there is a theme of Law vs. Chaos (and you can choose from what I understand) and the Christianity elements are primarily taken from Gnosticism applied to current popular culture, so I wouldn't necessarily call God, Lucifer, and others in that game equivalent to the Bible/Christian form of them.\n\nI am also one to believe that it is important to learn about other cultures/religions to see outside viewpoints to better connect/understand people.

I am not a Christian, nor believe in any religion.  But, because I will be transferring to a heavily Christian area I would like to learn more about the do's and don'ts, in order to be respectful to everyone ( I'm 13 btw). I usually play video games for 1 hour on Saturday, and another on Sunday.  It's a Call Of Duty franchise, called Warzone. It's an M-rated video game (like every other one), but I want to know if the act of killing in a video game is a sin.\n\nThis here is a video of little clips from the game, skip ahead to somewhere around 3 min, and you will understand what the action of the game is.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FGj9TCYlOE&ab\\_channel=TopWARZONEMoments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FGj9TCYlOE&ab_channel=TopWARZONEMoments)\n\nSo my final question is:  Is it appropriate for a Christian to play this game, (outside of the fact that some parents don't allow it)?\n\nThank you in advance for everyone's time!", "Has anyone here played the video game Blasphemous? What did you think about it?I can definitely recommend it both for its art direction, its narrative, and its gameplay. I thought I'd make a post about it here here because it was stimulating for me, as a Christian, to play it, so maybe some of you would find it worthwhile to check it out or play it, too.\n\nAesthetically, *Blasphemous* draws heavily on Christianity, especially the form Roman Catholicism has historically taken in Andalusia in southern Spain. Perhaps the most obvious example is the character design of the Penitent One, the protagonist, which draws inspiration from the *capirotes* worn by members of confraternities of penitents during Holy Week, as you can gather from this picture.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ml7rs9kn4baa1.jpg?width=830&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f82706f98dad906efcae98f6b9e7fe0c0e78079d\n\nThe game especially manages to capture the solemnity of the more melancholic and gruesome motifs of Catholic art, like pain and sorrow and tears and blood. There are many examples, but my personal favorite is the area known as the Graveyard of the High Peaks, the backdrop of which is decorated with mountains carved in the image of female faces streaked with tears formed of ice, reminiscent of portrayals of the Virgin Mary weeping for the sins of the world or the death of Jesus\u2014see below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a64os8wr7baa1.jpg?width=662&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=977aa60dcbb4bfdaa6791ae7508751afda8cdd7b\n\n*Blasphemous'* story is also concerned with themes relating to Christianity. It takes place in a fantasy world, specifically a country called Custodia, which is a theocracy centered around the worship of a deity called the High Will and an individual known as the Twisted One, the representations of which are clearly inspired by the Crucifixion, as you might be able to see in this image.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74kp7urhebaa1.jpg?width=330&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=25c07371c25016d372e20b14417edf4393ba7928\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Twisted One is described by Deogracias, a character in the game, as:\n\n>\\[A\\] devout and tormented youngster \\[who\\] asked the High Will for punishment. He placed a wooden log where he sat and prayed... He prayed for pain, so he could ease the guilt that sharply pierced his soul. Then the Grievous Miracle manifested itself. It made roots grow and twist over his arms and legs, but not a cry nor a complaint came out from his mouth. Every inhabitant of this land bore witness to it, and all of them prayed before the besought eternal joy of that youngster.\n\nThe plot of the game is concerned precisely with the effects of similar \"grievous miracles,\" which by the beginning of the game has left Custodia in ruins and overrun by monsters. The Penitent One is tasked with resolving the situation even as he comes closer to finding out why the High Will let the Grievous Miracle descend on Custodia. This leads him into conflict with the Mother of Mothers, the ruling church, which worships the suffering and death wrought by the Grievous Miracle.\n\nTheologically, the game is in many ways a critique of forms of Christianity that consider pain and suffering as a form of worship as well as of a God who would require it. But at the same time, the Penitent One is portrayed as heroic for his willingness to take upon himself, in a way that reflects what many Christians believe Jesus accomplished on the Cross, the sins of others. In sum, the game could be interpreted as contrasting dolorism with the ethical implications of substitutionary atonement.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is a relatively challenging Metroidvania. I could say more about that, but if anyone wants to hear it, hit me up in the comments. I always end up writing until after bedtime here.\n\nSo, God bless (or have a good one for you non-Christians)!", "Found the most fitting video game for christmasIt\u2019s called [I Am Jesus Christ](https://youtu.be/KomSV-wbIrE) - I can\u2019t tell who this game is really for though", "Is it a sin to hack in a video game?", "Understanding The Holy Trinity (God, Jesus, Holy Spirit) Using Video Games", "Are violent video games a sin?", "Are video games badIt\u2019s raining I\u2019m bored and want to play tf2 but my ocd is telling me the video game is to bad and it\u2019s a sin to play so what do you think and before someone asks team fortress 2 not titan fall", "Jesus in video gamesIs it disrespectful to put Jesus in video games?", "Is it a sin to play violent video games?I have always wondered if it is a sins to play violent video games like fallout or call of duty", "Is playing video games with sinful topics a sin?I have been playing video games most of my life and a majority of those games have had sinful topics in them.

Not to long after (within an hour) I started wondering if all of these games were sinful, well most of them. There are some things that I've come up with and want to share with others.\n\nLet's say a game gave you the option to worship something other than god and someone picks that option. That would be a sin for that person to do correct?\n\nWhat about stealing from other players in an online game? You actually take something from them therefore you stolen from them. That is undeniably a sin as you literally took something from them. Doesn't matter if it's virtual, you took something from them and that is theft.\n\nBut where I get confused is the murdering of other people or humanoids. Your not actually killing anyone but you're destroying an image of god so wouldn't that be a sin?\n\nSo if all of these are true than that eliminates a lot of games just on this alone. Doesn't mean all games are bad though. I really can't see shooting robots or building games as bad.\n\nSo there are many games of which I just can't see being played in heaven. Why would god allow Rust, Grand theft auto, Call of duty and so on in heaven?

Since lately I had nothing to worry about, it came back and now boom I have something to worry about now. But, let's get to the point. I'm wondering whether it's bad to play games, read books and watch movies where good and bad characters are fighting. I don't mean ones where everybody kills each other and they seem fine with it. I like a series of books where there are four Clans and they often fight over boundaries but their rules don't allow them to kill each other, even in the heat of battle. I read a lot of other things too, it's just an Example. People have different opinions about it. I got anxious from thinking about if my actions are bad or not. I decided to stop using media like these but my anxiety still didn't stop. I sometimes think that this isn't bad but then I get scared that when I die it will turn out that it was actually a sin and I've been sinning my whole life. I also don't want to fall into satans trap if it's him telling me that things about these actions not being sinful. I'm scared to sin and I need help.

Still I'm willing to stop doing this of this is a sin. I tried to ask God but I can't get the answer. Im afraid that my faith is really weak of that I'm irritating Him by asking so many times because I'm never sure (I used to pray and ask about if even two timed a day). I've read some Bible, too, and Jesus told us to avoid anything that seems evil. So that's my most reason to be anxious, because I don't know how to interpret His words. There are people saying that Minecraft and other similar games are evil and bad, and then there are people who say that there's nothing evil in them. I feel really bad right now and I feel like my world is getting unreal because of my anxiety about sinning. I'm scared to find out I've been doing bad thing my shoe life, and making Jesus and God sad. I'm also scared to wake up one day and find out it's all not real and this world is only in my mind. Please help me. I don't know what to do. I tried talking with my parents, they said they don't think it's wrong, that if I don't get obsessed it's fine.

Really scared. Please help me. I don't have anybody else to talk to. Also, how should I confess about one thing?

One person is looking at 'Evelina' and female representation, someone else is doing the same with 'The Blazing World', someone else is looking at the various translations of 'Dante's Inferno', so on and so forth. I've decided to look and Genesis (the King James version, along with the bible as a whole) and video games. Video games are dear to my heart and the text was more interesting than I first thought.\n\nImmediately I thought about Halo, The Binding of Isaac, and Bioshock, all games with religious tones in them. Halo is a semi-retelling of Noah's Ark with a sci-fi spin on it, The Binding of Isaac is a criticism of religion in general and borrows several idea from religion (plus it was the subject of the only Bible/video game paper I found), and Bioshock also looks at religion, with Rapture representing The Rapture, with a chosen few being allowed to live in what is perceived as paradise. I realise that people might not know what I'm going on about here, but it's more to show it's a serious question than anything else; if you'd like me to elaborate on anything, just ask and I'll be happy to.\n\nNot being religious though, I feel like I'll only be looking at thing from a non-religious perspective, and googling showed a few articles/websites/things. They seemed to be grouped into those which [defended](https://www.challies.com/articles/christian-men-and-their-video-games/) video games, those which [condemned](https://www.gotquestions.org/Christian-video-games.html) video games, or things like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/4jso4h/doom_2016_your_thoughts/) Reddit threat which seemed unsure how to feel. The Reddit thread had me thinking: games such as Doom and Agony draw heavily on religious idea, mostly that of Hell. I haven't played Agony (it's meant to be pretty bad), but it seems to be very focused on sin, especially sexual. Doom is similar, with the main character (Doomguy) having visions of hellish looking symbols, his only motivation being rage, anger, and revenge, nothing very pure. That and the game is *really* violent. That being said, if you're not adverse to that sort of stuff, try it out. It's really good, and if you look into it the narrative and character traits are amazing, especially considering the main character doesn't say a word throughout, but that's an essay for a different day. Games such as Outlast 2 also feature religion in a somewhat negative light.\n\nSo I'm curious to see what religious views on video games are: for some reason a lot of my YouTube recommended are videos on this topic ( I don't know why, I don't YouTube it), and they're split between people interpreting Galantians 5:13-17 to include video games (among other passages), and people who say 'the Bible doesn't mention it, but use common sense', probably in reference to ultra-violent game such as Doom, but not caring about things like Mario Kart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Glossary(?)***\n\nRapture - a fictional, paradise-like, city in Bioshock which is owned by a private individual who determines who is allowed in.\n\nHalo - similar to Noah's Ark. A race of forerunners (God) notice an alien species called 'The Flood' (the flood), and build these giant things called halos in order to A) preserve the genetic material of all living things and B) kill The Flood, after which they release the genetic material and repopulate everything.\n\nBinding of Isaac - a young boy is playing when his mother hears a voice she thinks is God telling her to kill her son. He escapes into the basement, which is basically the Pandora's Box of all things bad.

I've been playing video games since long before I became a Christian, and lately I've noticed a slight trend towards Christians speaking pejoratively about computer and video games and those who enjoy them. Maybe they don't enjoy games and so feel that they must be bad. Perhaps they just don't understand the modern gaming environment (that's pretty much a given).\n\nFor many, gaming doesn't seem to fit with their idea of the Christian as an active member of society. They seem to think that everyone who plays video games is a reclusive shut-in, and not the sort of people who are of any use in spreading the gospel. There's long been this undercurrent that the ideal Christian is outgoing, mentally stable, physically fit, and that anyone who fails to tick one of these boxes is doing something wrong and needs to seek God's help to improve themselves.\n\nThere also seems to be the outdated notion that the vast majority of gamers are men, and not only that but that the video games allow these men to continue in a pattern of \"arrested development\" where they remain child-minded and unable to function as a part of the Christian church body. This also feeds into trends that some Christians seem to propagate regarding masculinity, and how men should be seen as 'leaders', physically and mentally strong, pretty much the antithesis of the stereotypical \"gamer nerd\".\n\nOf course, many of these outside opinions are coloured by the fact that the wider Christian world remains largely uneducated about the state of modern gaming. Most still believe that video games are toys to be engaged with by children only, and even those who are aware that they are now the world's largest source of entertainment media mostly believe that if you are a \"gamer\", you are someone who plays dungeons & dragons/shooting games against random strangers on the Internet in your parents basement.\n\nThis sort of ignorance leaves myself and others like me hesitant to share one of our biggest passions with our Christian friends and church family, which I believe is a shame, not least because those of us that regularly play video games as Christians are embedded in one of the worlds largest and most vibrant societies and one where the Christian message is most greatly needed.\n\nI'd be interested to hear what the general consensus on video games is from the Christian community here, especially if you yourself are a \"Christian gamer\".

I'm looking for some shows and video games with bright, beautiful scenery, optimistic storylines, nobles heroes, and compelling villains without the gratuitous violence and sheer depravity found in shows like Game of Thrones. Bonus if they have Christian themes. I'm tired of stories where there are no real heroes, where everyone you care about dies, and death and despair are the main themes. I wish there were more shows with the moral center found in many shows in the 50s\\-90s, but with the superb special effects and action sequences we have now. I work long hours at a stressful job, and I want something relatively cheerful and uplifting. Having my kid being able to watch along with me would be a bonus.\n\nA few shows I've been watching recently that kind of fit the bill:\n\n\\-Hercules: The Legendary Journeys \\- Yes it's incredibly cheesy, but it has beautiful scenery (it's filmed in New Zealand), light hearted humor, and a moral center.

The Marvel TV shows are also good (objectively better overall), but they are quite dark.

Pre Christ (or BC heh), my life was filled with drugs and alcohol which eventually led me into a horrifying experience, which I wont really go into, that would have probably left me with paranoid schizophrenia or psychosis if God hadn't held me in His arms through the whole thing (and continues to hold me even today). This experience was connected/related partially with the activities of D&D and Video Games, so I know how the devil uses these avenues to get to people (I mean really, most video games and entertainment out there provides no spiritual nourishment at all). After the experience I had become extremely strict with the things I was involved in. In the early stages of recovery I most definitely had traces of psychosis, which made me strict on things I really shouldn't have been paranoid about. As I have grown and strengthened in Jesus this paranoia has virtually disappeared Praise God!I am venturing out more and more, exploring and testing things to see if they are potentially okay to be involved in with my walk with God. For Video Games, I can see the potential for spiritually nourishing game play, especially looking at **\"Christian Game Developers Conference\" (CGDC)** and the projects that people are involved with. However, there aren't really any \"good\" christian games out there. I have also thought about how connecting with friends over playing video games can be beneficial in conversation, but I am a little concerned that its like the \"Christian going to a party to influence people for God\"  type situation where the Christian ends up getting influenced more by the party people than vise versa, but instead with other players influencing you or even the game through emotional design (Yeah emotional design is a huge influencer in all media types, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hjm9LLSICg) or [this book](https://motamem.org/upload/Emotional-Design-Why-We-Love-or-Hate-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman.pdf) if you are interested in learning more about this topic). I am also concerned about this with playing D&D again. I would love to play with my old friends (non Christians who still do drugs and stuff) but I am not sure if it would be the best way for me to get involved in there lives again. Those guys had been my clan for most of high school, but after Jesus saved me everything just collapsed. It could be for the best that I am not really connected with them anymore, who knows why God may have broken those relationships. \n\nI am open to the idea of playing D&D or (some) Video Games with a group of Christian friends who could \"hang out\" and talk about spiritual things or play a spiritually nourishing campaign. But then you have to take into account the view some have that you could be doing much better things with your time, like activities directly involved with spreading the gospel or helping the poor, or whatnot.  \nI also have considered the view some have that \"God can spiritually guard you from whatever you are involved in\" But I also believe we shouldn't be careless in the activities we participate in.

It is a Roleplaying table top game that involves the imagination of players in creating and exploring an fantasy medieval world.

I love God and going to church and I think believing in him is logical and correct. It just feels like people in my church are just not willing to listen to other people's perspectives on things without it turning into a mini preach session. I play games within reason too. I usually avoid the more mature stuff like Mortal kombat because of the intense gore it has since it makes me uncomfortable. (I will not judge if you play that game though) But other than that I still enjoy video games. Is there any way I can open up about this without people possibly judging me?

By which I mean Frogger and Minecraft have non violent options but there is no good or evil in those games besides not dying. Mario, Zelda and Sonic have heroes and villains but the heroes only win through superior force. And before you mention Undertale the reason that game was so shocking was that its nonviolence moral made you play completely differently from most video games to do so, the exception that proves the rule.\n\nSo I mean even if you switched \"I prayed to Hylia\" to \"I prayed to God\" would that make Zelda any more Christian?

There are various corpses of games that I played for maybe a few hours, or a few weeks, all with intriguing ideas but none capturing my interest at the time. There was one in particular that eluded me. It was a grindfest of a game, with a very small playerbase, seemingly on life support. The last time I touched it was in 2010, but I've thought a fair bit about it since.\n\n[Ashen Empires](https://store.steampowered.com/app/937380/Ashen_Empires/), and [Dransik](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1871470/Dransik/) before it, represent 25 years of being an Ultima Online ripoff. That's somewhat unfair, they started out that way, but they became their own thing over time. Well, they've been given new life with new active developers, a small jump in player numbers, a newish (4-month old) server, and a real presence on Steam and Discord. Ashen started as one of the first MMO's to value tradeskills and combat skills equally towards overall level and stat gains, encouraging a constant incentive loop to bounce between the two and to generate new resources, which I've found particularly addicting.\n\nOutside of nostalgia, and the admission that the game is mostly a grind box, I've found Ashen Empires to be great for TV marathoning and for both short and long bursts. Hypnotic would be my primary description, a second job would be my other one. If you ever got into UO, or Runescape, or Haven and Hearth, Ashen might just be that bit of gaming nostalgia that you're missing.", "I'm an 8 bit game developer and I want to create a game where you are in from like right after Adam and eve, and you basically live through history trying to examine your empire and all that uptil present day, question is, is it blasphemy to have an 8 bit Jesus?", "Do Christians enjoy going to NFL games or did I just have a bad experience? Seemed more like a hedonistic retreat.I went to an NFL game recently and it left me very sad about the state of professional sports and the world in general.  I don't spend much time watching sports and keeping up with them, but my brother does, so I see it often enough on TV while at home.  My expectations for this game were high because I was going to see old friends that I hadn't seen in years, and the game had playoff implications. \n\nUnfortunately what I noticed when we got down there was what I'll list below:\n\n\\- Constant cursing - It was almost as if each person was trying to outdo the other in how many times they could use foul language.  Alcohol and drugs fueled this so that by the 3rd quarter it was in half the comments I heard.\n\n\\- GD's - You can roll this in with cursing I guess but I heard this beauty a few times an hour.\n\n\\- Alcohol consumption - This seemed like the main focus of the day.  I had to give away water because people forgot to bring it, but everyone had a 12-pack of beer and liquor on hand.  Alcohol is a poison that is socially acceptable and pushed for profit by private and governmental organizations (tax).  I had a harder time finding water in the stadium than I did alcohol for some strange reason.\n\n\\- Drugs - As if the alcohol wasn't a big enough concern, you compound that with weed and whatever other drugs they had on hand...it was rough.  Getting as high/drunk as you could possibly be without passing out seemed to be a game in itself.\n\n\\- Glorifying violence - Throughout the game, I heard about snapping this, breaking that, smashing him, knocking out, etc.  I realize the game is physical, but the combination of drunkenness and herd mentality took this to an entirely unhealthy level.\n\n\\- Driving under the influence (DUI) - Based on my experience before the game, during the game, and after the game, I 100% assure you that a LARGE number of people drove home over the legal limit that night.  They assume they'll be ok as thousands of people are driving home intoxicated also, so the odds of getting pulled over are low.  Trust me, that won't matter if you end up killing yourself or others.  Driving under the influence is one of the most selfish and deadly things you can do, and it is totally acceptable at professional sporting events (I guess).\n\nI enjoyed the game otherwise but I don't know if I can go to another one.  If I do, I think I'll totally skip the pregame portion or find a family-friendly section next time, if that is possible.

If I rember correctly, the preacher was trying to make a point about faith and worship.\n\nHearing that, I also recalled watching some random generic christian film in which a highschool american football coach prayed with his team to glorify God in the game and, if they win, dedicate it to Him.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be offensive or anything but it just seems kind of pointless. I mean, there are exponentially better ways to glorify God, be it by serving others, helping your neighbor, preaching His Word, singing to Him or praying in gratitude and awe. Sure, saying \u201cI dedicate this gold medal to God\u201d sound cool, but I feel like it\u2019s just a waste of time.\n\nI know that Paul said that even when we eat, we should eat to glorify God, but I think he was just trying to illustrate that we need to always think of our actions in terms of: \u201c\u00bfIs this something that will ultimately lead me to worship God?\u201d Instead of literally considering that the act of eating is glorifying Him\n\nI understand that God helps us, but \u00bfshould I really be praying for a game? I know God listens to us and all, and he is absolutely capable of giving me victory every time, but I just think it\u2019s a silly thing to ask for. Also, \u00bfis winning a football match really heightening the Name of the Lord?\n\nI\u2019m not saying everything I do is perfect and all of my actions have the purpose of glorifying God, so much so that I feel it\u2019s somewhat dumb to adamantly declare so. I don\u2019t watch a movie to glorify God, I do it just to pass some time.

But he fears people too often engage in \"political hobbyism.\" They \"telescope their interests,\" fixating on Washington D.C. or the nightly discourse on cable news, rather than looking closer to home, he said.  \n>  \n>This allows us to accept, then project caricatures of our neighbors handed down from the top, encouraging us to view them as enemies, he said. If we sat down in good faith with people who hold differing views on national politics, we'd likely recognize local common ground, he added.\n\nSo how do we fix Christianity?\n\nWhat's the game plan?\n\nWhat's the goal?\n\nWhat's proven successful and what hasn't?\n\nIs it worth saving?\n\nI'm honestly undecided but I've been leaning towards saying maybe not.\n\nI'm a former Christian who's really upset about what this religion has done to us, and Christians are often their own worst victims. Society is being torn apart as family members abandon each other over disagreements about LGBTQ and political polarization. Kids are committing suicide and doing shooter drills in school while everyone bickers about a culture war.\n\nEvery Christian I know is pretty upset about it too, but they blame the other Christians. It's not the religion's fault, they say, it's those other people who aren't doing it right.\n\nHere's one perspective:\n\n>Christianity has been corrupted by those who forsake the word of God. They know we're right about what the Bible really says but refuse to see the truth. Hell is a real place and my love prevents me from remaining silent about. Someday you'll wish you'd listened!\n\nHere's another:\n\n>If Christians paid attention to what Jesus was saying, they'd understand its true message. We're not called to judge and discriminate but to love everyone as our neighbor without exception. Absent this compassion, Jesus suggests he might not recognize you.\n\nMaybe it's not anyone's fault but the blasted religion.\n\nI hate to break it to everyone, but there's two very different Gods in the Bible. They have a different set of books, were written in separate times and describe two completely different characters with totally different idea about morality.\n\nPeople use *Biblical* as an adjective and we know it means: *awful*. But that's primarily because of the other guy, not Jesus. But Jesus is permanently attached to the rest of it, so how can there be agreement when your book has two different gods smashed together?\n\nAlso, call me crazy, but maybe having child sacrifice as your core tenant isn't a good moral foundation.\n\nBut let's not kid ourselves. This religion isn't going away in our lifetimes.\n\nShould we do our best to fix it?\n\nOr is it time to love Christians but not their Christianity?\n\nI have a lot of respect and admiration for the Universalists. As one of the most rational of the bunch, they seemed to have figured out how to stick with the good and discard the bad ideas inspired by the Bible. I suspect they accomplish this with naturally evident morality to balance their reading of scripture. At the same time, I still worry about the corrupting influence of the book.\n\nStill, if Christians were mostly Universalists, the world would be a much better place. But is that even possible? Are those kinds of churches growing? What are the chances of succeeding? Even if everything worked out perfectly, it would probably take centuries. Can we really afford to wait that long?\n\nFor my part, I feel like convincing Christians to abandon fundamentalism is probably easier than convincing then to abandon the faith, but which is ultimately better?", "Is Fortnite a morally bad game???So, recently by scrolling down to the bottom of Fortnite instagram page..

And some that may not be as good.\n\nI am resigning from being a mod here.  I've learned while I was here, and I may stay, but I cannot stay a moderator here.  There are just far too many problems that no one wants to fix (or, even worse, people deny or blame me for).  So I'm done on the 28th.\n\nIt started when Bruce failed to follow through with banning someone.  The person had yet another infraction and I was like, \"well, ok, Bruce must've forgot to ban them, I'll do it.\"  This resulted in Bruce blaming me and being threatening and uncharitable, of which three (3) mods told Bruce that was uncharitable of him.  No apology or anything, and it dragged on for months until the person apparently did enough bad things that someone eventually was able to meet Bruce's ultra-high standards and ban them.  While that was going on, the person in question harassed all kinds of people in here.  This made me think and feel that Bruce doesn't care about us as people, but I held on to that and waited thinking maybe my perceptions were off.\n\nNope.  In the now infamous 2022 Halloween incident, Bruce made it very clear that he indeed doesn't care about his mod's feelings with his \"I don't care about that\" response.  I called him on the phone and asked him to immediately change course, apologize to those he said this to, and engage in conflict resolution.  (You can Google these.)  He didn't, so we lost 2 mods that night, and then the fall-out was that we lost another.\n\nOn that night, I pulled all 5 or so mods into a chat and begged them to try to channel their anger towards a modification of the mod expectations document.  They instead wanted to try to oust him as lead mod, which I discouraged them from doing.  I was trying to hold the mod team together, but it came too late, and since I wasn't the person who caused the rift, it didn't help much.  So I sat down and established a 3 phase response from me.\n\nIn phase 1, I set about changing the mod expectations so that it is spelled out that mods do NOT remove each other's permissions, but instead seek conflict resolution, and if that is unattainable, contact Bruce for resolution rather than removing each other's permissions (that should be saved only for extremes like an account hack).  I put it up, but few mods gave input, and no one wanted to change it.  Their reply was \"well Bruce trusts us,\" and mine was \"well, yes, trust, but verify.\"  I proposed another fix to address another issue with the way mods behaved on Halloween 2022, and proposed that we establish lead mod expectations.  Among things I said were that the lead mod serves us mods and the channel, not just the channel.  It went nowhere.  I would've been fine if any of these 3 had received substantial input that would let me refine the proposals but they didn't even get that hardly.\n\nSo a month later, I began phase 2.  I said it's time we have a new lead mod.  I asked Bruce to peacefully step aside so someone else could lead.  I had AgentSmithRadio in mind to lead, as he works in a people job, and has the exact strengths I felt Bruce still lacks (though he could work on them, he seems to not be doing so).  Crickets.  Indeed, ironically, even AgentSmithRadio was opposed because he felt I should instead speak to all the mods behind Bruce's back, i.e. politic, then bring it to outsider.  (Not saying this to say ASR is wrong.)  Not to mention the history, that twice people had asked Bruce to step down before.  In this process, though, I asked Bruce specifically to answer two questions (i.e. even trying to sort of downgrade my complaints).   First, how his actions contributed to the events of Halloween and how he was going to change so it doesn't happen again.\n\nNothing.  If anything, then, he doubled down on how he perceived the event as everyone ganging up on wanttoknowaboutit.  But wanttoknowaboutit removed permissions from TWO mods that night.  I wouldn't dare to even remove one mod's permissions because I already know (ASR taught me) that this is not how you resolve conflicts.\n\nI had reached out to wanttoknowaboutit saying that while I do not like what he did, that I am willing to put it behind me and rebuild trust.  Everyone was like \"rebuild trust?! :o\"  I guess people think that you should just give people your trust even when they do something that clearly shows they're (temporarily) not trustworthy.\n\nBut anyways, so yeah, it seems to me Bruce is incapable of even admitting he made any mistakes.  He was going to defend wanttoknowaboutit removing TWO (2) mod's permissions, even though I was taught this from the start.  If this is a failure of training, it's on Bruce as acting lead mod.  What did we do to fix it?  Nothing, no interest in putting it in the mod expectations so mods read it and obey it.  No interest in him being accountable to the mod team on this issue.  No interest in him listening to me on how to grow some emotional intelligence so that he can become the good leader of people he has the capacity to become.  Nothing.\n\nSo faced with the fact that it was going to continue to be \"business as usual\" and get threatened any time Bruce is unhappy, I'm done.  I've learned some while here, like from ASR and gnurdette.  But I'm done.  No one should tolerate being in a toxic situation when it's a volunteer position.  I don't have time for this.  Half the mod team isn't even active from our HQ, and therefore not really even accountable to any of us.  I wonder if they just got sick of it and sort of went passive.  I have no clue.  Few, if any, have replied.\n\nAnd outsider didn't honor my request to talk about this.\n\nSo I'm done on the 28th.  I used to say I was a mod here as a badge of honor.  But the badge has rusted and fallen off my lapel.  So I'm gone.\n\nSome have already started trying to claim this is me being toxic.  Toxic would be to politic behind Bruce's back and then try to take him down by going to outsider, which I didn't do.  Some will also claim I'm \"threatening\" to leave here.  No, I'm expressing the feedback that being here in this environment makes me want to quit.  To deny it by claiming I'm \"threatening\" is some textbook dysfunctional family / team dynamics.  The mod team needs someone who actually knows how to manage the human element of teams to come in and fix the mod team and help them heal, not Bruce, who doesn't seem to either see it or care about it.\n\nhttps://gaminggorilla.com/20-reasons-quit-playing-video-games/\n\nSo using the above wisdom, yes, it feels like a waste of time, feels like a low return on time invested, the mod team seems to have a skewed sense of reality brought on by leadership neglect, modding here detracts too much from my goals, and hijacks my pleasure.  It's gotten so bad that my interest in anything else is skyrocketing.  Let's hope in less than a year the situation here improves.  It was only until today someone, for instance, even decided to create the LGBTQIA+ tag for discussions, but will that fix the long-standing complaint so many have about how this subreddit seems to only be a place to argue about LGBTQIA+ issues?  Not likely.  (Granted I got banned from Christians because I apparently am \"heretical\" because I believe the LGBTQIA+ should not be treated like garbage....)  Bruce is like the guy at the car garage that has been working on cars 20 years becoming management.  He's great at cars, but I don't think he can hack it as management, and I don't think he's willing to work on it, so he should probably go back to car maintenance, where he excelled.\n\nSo in the words of Hayao Miyazaki, \"Valuse.\"  I will stick around but I have stuff to do, like spend time with family.

I was born In a Christian family and everyone I know (including cousins, the  other cousins, aunts and uncles too) pray to God, sometimes attend Church but never read the Bible and somehow, they say that God works In their lives and helps them even though they are ordinary people living life and working, hobbies, whatever. They usually don't lie so...I was like them before reading the Bible. Before reading It, I had personal experiences with God, feel God's love and help, all through prayer, trust and trying not to sin). I knew the important stuff from the church and my Christianity teacher...However, I started reading the Bible (thinking that It's God's word) and oh boy... i should have sticked to prayers. The Bible made me anxious, made me even somewhat hate God sometimes. After reading the Bible I don't feel close to God anymore and my prayers don't work now. The Bible also messed with my head, gave me even the fear of hell (and tbh I don't believe everything In It because It's a mix of faith, truth, immorality, good lessons, bad lesson, weird stuff, mythology, stories, cruelty, rules and some historical events maybe. I hope that doesn't mean I am not saved or something, lol.)

I am trying to save myself for the one, but honestly it feel utterly impossible.\n\nI am so lost as to how the bible is so pro sex and pro youthful marriage, but the marriage age is now 30 (in America at least). Honestly I have gone to singles conferences, I have prayed, I have read my bible, even tried drowning myself in video games to distract myself. I cant avoid feeling like something is missing. I was thought that maybe I just need more of God in my life.\n\nI recently read Genesis in hopes that maybe I would get an answer to my frustration when God created man and women. I noticed that God created people with a intentional piece missing that is to be fulfilled by a significant other. Where he has intentionally said I can fill this God sized hole in you but I am giving you woman to fill a space in you that I intentionally made myself.\n\n\" Then the LORD God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper who is just right for him.'.\" - Genesis 2:18, The Bible\n\nI am at a place where I don't know how to feel. I have all this pent up sexual frustration and I want to exercise my sexuality within the confines of marriage. There is so much guilt, shame, and anxiety attributed to this also. I feel lost. I have never been more fulfilled in my walk with God in my whole life and how is this need to relieve my sexual frustration so present?! I am borderline questioning everyone who is acting like everything is ok in my church and older singles acting like everything is ok as if they are able to control it so gracefully.\n\nI just think they are straight lying. There isn't no way you are not feeling like a caged animal at this point. They have to be masturbating or something to be that calm. For those that sexuality isn't a need, the data is extremely clear as to how singleness shortens your life and have endless benefits to your mental and physical health. These aren't \"benefits\" either. Its a necessity. It would be like saying not exercising is ok. Not exercising will lead to a shortened life in the same way lack of companionship will.\n\nI dont really know what im getting at in this post. I just feel frustrated, sad, anxious, uneasy, shame, and so many emotions. I thought that if I was right with God this feeling would go away like people said. The getting right with God part is a weight lifted off my shoulders, but this sexual frustration is very much present and really frustrating. I don't know what to do.

Don't tell me they aren't planning on doing it. The hysteria and dehumanization surrounding LGBT people right now is the same type of hysteria that Hitler generated around Jews. A Texas Republican compiled a list of all the documented trans people in the state and I'm sure he didn't do it because he wants to get to know them on a personal level. An Arizona Republican said they should be rounded up \"for their own protection\". The party-wide silence to comments like these and those made by MTG demonstrate they would all be complicit in it. \n\nI'm sorry but Republicans just aren't playing the same game as Democrats anymore.

And If we are no saved we go to a \"Hell eternity torture place\" which Jesus clearly teached In detail. Why would God make It so hard for us to be saved? Well...maybe since many years passed since Adam and Eve, homosapiens's nature degraded - becoming immoral. Like, some part of our nature is a glitch In a game and we are the \"game\" and the glitch is \"the sin\". But doesn't that sound silly? Maybe the devil corrupted Us, but that (If taken literally) It's very silly. \n\nAnd If God Is all powerful and all knowing then he'd know how hard It Is for us not to sin and being powerful and caring he would send a clear message or just take the nature He doesn't like (sinful nature) away. Like that, most Christians won't be so stressed because of sin anymore. \n\nBut seriously, eternal torment In a hellish place for eternity? Isn't that evil from God? \n\nBy paying evil with more evil (eternal torture) Is beyond evil, especially coming from the loving God we know. \n\nBut If a human could burn someone for eternity, would that human do It? If yes, then God's not more evil but equal to us and that doesn't sound right. God logically, biblically, and theologically speaking can't be equal to us. Okay, but we have free will, right? So then we choose If we go to hell or heaven, so that 'justifies God'. Well...For real? I worry and wonder about those born with brain defects... \n\nWe, common people, who attended school, learned somewhat and have ok brain capacity can choose between right and wrong (well, mostly, we are taught morals and live In society) and we have the capacity to love to the fullest (maybe some of us not that much)... Anyway, those who are born with brain defects and I won't get into science details here, certainly don't have a free will. Why? Because maybe they aren't even aware they exist, so how can they possibly believe In Jesus or have the brain capacity to choose right over wrong, or even love? Where do they end up In? Hell? I have problems with this. They don't have free will. \n\nThere are people that are born with a brain problem that also make It impossible for them to understand what you say, meaning of words, and judge, therefore they can't believe In anything, including Jesus. Are they going to hell? \n\nFor all denominations, because all denominations have a different view of hell : these people who are born with extreme disabilities so they can't know what Is good or bad, right or wrong (then there's no right or wrong written In our hearts, we learn It), so then how can they follow Jesus or do any good deeds? Impossible. \n\nNot only that, but we know we aren't aware of anything until 6 or 8 years old, only then we learn the difference between right and wrong from our parents or the people and culture we grew up In and It's something that you can't erase from your head after a certain age. \n\nWhy doesn't God bring justice In this world? Why not just stop the many crimes and unjust acts? And then, why eternal hell when things can be solved here In time? \n\nAnd, more, there are people who know nothing about the Bible or Christianity. So what about them? For me, It just proves that Christianity Is just a religion like any other. \n\nIf Christianity Is true, then why does God let there be many religions 50.000+ globally and 40.000+ Gods? That means that God doesn't care about their salvation. They aren't saved, Biblically speaking. \n\nOh, so I follow the Bible? YES and NO. The Bible has wisdom and good lessons to learn but also immorality, weird stuff, gruesome stuff, scientific errors and contradictions. And If two statements about the same thing are In contradiction with one another, then only one can be the truth. And you know whats weird? At that time, every Christian, even Jesus believed the WHOLE Bible, why? Because science and logic and what we have now to know the truth, the people at that time did not have It. Homosapiens's brain evolved since then. So If Jesus was wrong about the Noah's Ark, then He could have been wrong about hell too so then what's the point of my question about hell? I say Noah's ark did not happen because logically speaking and scientifically speaking Is *Impossible*.\n\nAnd If the Bible should be interpreted in only one way because some believe or read that It has only one truth then why doesn't God reveal the right interpretations or something? The Bible shouldn't be a book used to make a cult but to make you \"smarter\" or give you more knowledge which I agree on. The Bible Is also a book of faith, tradition, myths, parables, fictive stories, history and manipulation.\n\nBut why did God allow wars because of the Bible?\n\nI have more to say and more question to ask but that will take me 100 years to write.

There really is no help for this, even from God, it's just become a reality of sorts, that some day I very well may just end all of this. \n\nWhat happened to those days? Where each day was new and thoughts like this never existed. The days of being a kid and life was pretty amazing and wondrous. Why have they been replaced with this. I'm guessing that reality doesn't exactly exist when you're a kid, because you eventually grow up and realize that...what's a good way to put it so it's...I cannot put it any other way besides that life is not what I thought it was as in those days. \n\nYes, I do not love God. Do not give thanks for my life regardless of how good that I have it. In order to look upon how good that I do, have to think about those who are starving or dying or just in complete pain and misery. Springboard off of others people's misfortunes. Just something wrong about doing it that way. Just so happy that life doesn't last forever. Some day, one way or the other, I'll not have this mind of mine anymore. Thank God for that. \n\nCannot help but look once in a while, go and read about or watch a video, someone who left Christianity and why that was. For this particular individual who spent 20 years as a Christian, they had multiple reasons. One of the biggest was what did it mean to actually follow Christ and when does one know when they've actually heard back from God/Jesus. And why is it so vague when apparently they want a relationship with you but it's this cryptic and/or guessing game. God, did I just hear from you and was my prayer just answered? Or was the person who claimed to hear back, basically, just hearing back from themselves and not God. \n\nAll of that would get met with the same reply from other Christians. Which I've ran into as well. God ways are higher than mine and past understanding, just keep seeking the Lord and wait patiently to hear back he'll answer your prayers just keep seeking. Then he goes to church and people are just hearing from God all the time and getting thier prayers answered. He's left confused and trying but not really sure what's going on. So with all that and a bunch of other things, he left Christianity. \n\nHe found something else that worked. Was not another religious avenue more like a seminar with resources and a different way to look at life. Through different eyes, and that it's OK to look at life in different ways, not just one way, one way and truth and life. And I'm still left two years later after accepting Jesus and trying to stick with this, but the thoughts about not really wanting to be a part of life are here more than they ever have been in my entire life. \n\nPeople's minds seem to revert back to when, in a way, they were kiddos and life became more radiant once more. Jesus gave them new life or a reverted life. I'm just drifting forward, in the wrong direction, Jesus and God now that they are here, these thoughts of wanting to leave are more prevalent than ever. \n\nSomething wrong about that. Obviously. And of course it gets put back on me from Christians I'm doing something wrong or just blaming God when it's my fault. They defend God when God doesn't need defended, he's God. But there's no way God....just God getting defended. Or keep seeking, or his ways are this and that and that and this. \n\nThings have just gotten worse, with God in my life. Sane worse, normal operating levels worse. It's basically like anything else, get told to change your mind and the way you look at things just read your Bible because God spells it all out in there. It's easy. Maybe it is in fact time to find a different book and a different avenue. The pain is not going away with God around. It's getting worse. Or just not going away, subsiding. \n\nAnd of course all of this will get met with life is more challenging and painful as a Christian, there's a verse in the Bible that says so.

All the large denominations have become woke and no longer teach sound doctrine. It is all about the money.\u00a0 I'm not saying they are not at some level trying to save souls, or that there are not good people in the denominations but those at the top of all the major denominations have more in common with the synagogues of Jesus\u2019s time than they do with Jesus.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Matthew 16:12\u00a0\u201c then they knew that he did not say to beware of the leaven of bread but from the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees\u201d. Well, the majority of churches today have fallen for the false doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. They have become \u201c woke\u201d and enlightened and will preach either the gospel of money or sin. The prosperity gospel is one most people are aware of, but the gospel of sin? That is the idea of \u201c as long as you believe that Jesus died for your sins then you can sin all you want and you don't even have to feel guilty about it because Jesus already paid for that sin you commit daily\u201d.\u00a0 Now in\u00a0Matthew 21:12\u00a0\u201c And Jesus entered into the temple of God and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple. And He overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves\u201d.\u00a0 Not a lot has changed, the Pharisees and Sadducees allowed this because they got huge kickbacks. Just like both of the gospels are getting paid also to spread their false doctrine.\u00a0\n\nThe prosperity gospel well started out as a scam and still is fooling people with its false doctrine. The sin gospel well that one did not start out that way but in truth is just another battle lost to the adversary.\u00a0 it started out with good intentions. Let everyone hear the gospel because the law is not for the righteous but for the sinners.\u00a01st Timothy 1:9-10\u00a0\u201c knowing this that law is not laid down for righteous one, but for lawless and undisciplined ones, for ungodly and sinful ones, for unholy and profane ones, for slayers of fathers and slayers of mothers, for murderers, for fornicators, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and if any other thing opposes sound doctrine\u201d. So these people need to know the scripture the most. So churches (to help fill their pews) started to go and seek these people.\u00a0\n\nAt first, it was just to come and listen to the message, then like any person that believes marriage will change a wayward partner, the church started allowing the sinners to get more involved to include them in the church so they will see the light and change from their evil ways. Well, they did not change and instead of removing the sinners, they kept giving the sinner more important roles in the church with the hopes( like that of a battered partner) this will finally turn them from their sinful ways. Well, it did not and now those churches are perverted and teach a gospel that God does not approve of at all.\u00a0 Literally, the sinners are in charge of the message, and are they going to preach against their lifestyle? Are they going to preach the truth? Are they going to sacrifice their cash cow for the truth? The answer is no. this was the adversary's game plan all along, he plays the long game ten, twenty, hundred, a thousand years means nothing to him. Those \u201cshepherds\u201d that let the wolves in did not keep the faith and only cared about filling the pews and not the message. Now around the globe especially in the west the church is being taken over and perverted by sinners.\u00a02nd Timothy 4:3-4\u00a0\u201c for a time will be when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own lust, they will heap up to themselves teachers tickling the ear. And they will turn away the ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths\u201d.\u00a0\n\nChristian churches in the west have started to curb their language on talking about or condemning certain things because of \u201c hate\u201d speech laws being, submitted, voted on, or passed in many countries. They sound good on paper \u201c get rid of \u201chate\u201d speech, but it is not. It stifles free speech, also anything can be called \u201chate\u201d speech. Do you think the adversary is not going to use this to shut the church up?\u00a0 That is a major goal of his.\u00a0\n\nCan this be changed?

It has me wondering if either my life is flashing before my eyes very slowly day by day or i have already lived this life and i sort of got a second chance with glimpses of events that have happened before but i am yet again living. Another example of this would be that i had a image/scene pop into my head at completely random of me at a football game and this guy with glasses and a blue scarf walks right by me who looks awfully similar to someone i know , and after this popped into my head i start to think well that was a weird and strangely vivid thought.

My coworker invited me and I agreed to go, despite my irrational fear of Christian based religions and the lack of an ability to meet new people. \n\nMy fear of Christianity stems from some personal trauma, >!my dad went through really bad alcohol withdrawals and started having insanely wild hallucinations relating to Christian stuff.!<\n\nAgain, despite my fears, I decided to go. I had a ton of anxiety before, but walking in I immediately felt very welcomed. Nobody there knows I am Agnostic besides my coworker, and I do not want to participate in religious activities. But I had a ton of fun, we played games and had snacks, and everyone watched this video from the group and the topic was dating. Minus any religious talk in the video, I really took home a lot of things from it. Summed up it basically said to be the best person you can be, and to put yourself first. That a real relationship is with someone you really love and that you can see yourself spending the rest of your life with.\n\nI feel like I learned a lot, even if these were things I already knew, it just cemented it more into my brain, makes it feel more prioritized. Then after the video we all split up into gender and age groups and talked about what we learned from the video and just about it in general and I really enjoyed that, too. \n\nI surprised myself with how easy it was for me to get out of my shell and talk with everyone. I am great at talking to people but the \"shell\" is the part I am always concerned about. I immediately felt like I could be \"real\" there.\n\nWhich leads me to, I want to go again next week. I REALLY want to go again next week. But again, I am agnostic and I never plan on being religious. I want to keep attending every week but I do not want to be disrespectful at all. I do not want to go if sitting out of prayer makes them feel disrespected or upset. My coworker was so ecstatic that I was interested in going again.\n\nPlease give me advice. I do not want to be disrespectful, I know nothing about the bible. And if anything I said in this post is considered disrespectful towards the religion please tell me, the last thing I want is to be disrespectful (if you couldn't tell.)\n\nAlso a bit of background info, I am new-ish to the area and I do not have any friends besides my coworkers. If I am not working I am most likely sleeping, even at school. This was the first time in months I ever \"hung out\" with people and I have not made new friends in years. \n\nPlease send advice. I appreciate it a lot, thank you for reading this much <3", "Is this a fair way to look at marriage/relationships?\nHello everyone, My husband and I have been married for 4 years however, the beginning of last year was when things started to get difficult. \n\nI don\u2019t want to go into a huge amount of detail. I\u2019ll just say my husband and I are trying to work through things mostly it being personality differences, upbringings, etc. \n\nI was just curious if this particular mindset was a common one. Should one put an expectation on another person and get mad at them for not meeting it? \n\nMy husband believes in a relationship , the two people have the responsibility to be there for one another (I don\u2019t disagree with this). However, he feels that if we have a disagreement and depending on the situation, if it causes him to be upset it is MY responsibility to try to calm him down and vice verse. Which I strongly disagree. Here is an example that actually happened. \n\nWe were meeting up with friends for dinner, we find the restaurant and look for parking. I told him hey let\u2019s see if the building over there (which is where I thought we were going) had parking , he turns the car to a different area and says \u201cwell ima park over here \u201c and I say \u201cwhy? we haven\u2019t even checked if the parking next to the building was correct, why go to paid parking?\u201d \n\nlong story short we circle twice and end up parking in the paid parking after I found out the building I was pointing to wasn\u2019t the place and he had gotten mad (he was also hungry before we left). he claimed I don\u2019t just accept what he wants to do and I always want to do what I want to do (which is a whole another issue I won\u2019t go into ). we park and he just sits there. says he needs a min to calm down so I kept quiet, 5 mins later he says \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to dinner , I want to just go home\u201d  so I look at him and say \u201cWhy ? we are already here , our friends are inside waiting for us\u201d he says he doesn\u2019t care and I don\u2019t remember what I said but his response was \u201cit feels like i\u2019m not being assisted with being calmed down\u201d something along those lines. \n\nIma fast forward a bit:\nHe\u2019s calm after I talk to him and we go in and eat and after a few hours we leave. We get to the car , he says to me\u201d thank you for being there for me and calming me down\u2026\u201d so I say \n\u201c no problem but can I ask u something ?\u201d\n\nhe says to me yes and I asked him was he waiting for me to try to \u201ccalm him down \u201c when he said he needed a min to calm down after we parked. He says yes and so I ask him does he see how that is such a dangerous mindset , to wait around for someone to calm u down ? I can understand if I upset him by sayin something mean then yes. But we get in a small spat and he gets mad and he expected me to calm him down?? he claims that I want the same thing and mentions that when I get upset and I cry and walk into another room . He comes and comforts me (this doesn\u2019t happen as often he literally did this yesterday but most times he\u2019ll let me cry and go off to play games cause he\u2019s upset ) and i\u2019m like yes but I don\u2019t walk away expecting u to come after me , in the past I did if he said something that made me mad but i never climb down his throat about it like he has done to me. plus I don\u2019t get mad at him if he doesn\u2019t do it. I just ask him next time we talk that i\u2019d like for him to do that cause it makes me feel like he cares for me. I can get over things with some time. I dont need him to come comfort me TO get me to calm down . When he comes comforting me, it makes me think he cares and speeds up the process of calming down, but it\u2019s not required for me to calm down\n.\nAlso I had asked him if I hadn\u2019t calmed u down would we have left and gone home and he says yes(I have not done this at all , i will admit i did once in the past but majority of the time he is the one that\u2019ll bail literally as we are about to go do something all because he\u2019s upset and I could be upset too but i push those feelings to the side and be an adult)\n\nIn the end, I reiterated what he mentioned which is. Depending on the situation he may be able to calm himself down or needs me to do it. I do not mind being there for him but I do not like the fact that he will remain mad if I don\u2019t and it can last for days (this has happened MANY times ). and he\u2019ll be mad at me for not calming him down especially if it not in the specific way he wants it to be or else he won\u2019t be receptive to my efforts. this is the expectation he has that he feels needs to be so in relationships. \n\nThen he says  i\u2019m the same way and i\u2019m like all i\u2019ve ever asked you to do is if i\u2019m upset and YOU upset me and you are coming to right the wrong to let it be sincere and apologize. that\u2019s it\u2019, what ever that looks like to you, just do it. I don\u2019t add anything specify like u need to stroke my hair with ur left hand, like it just have to be sincere and apologize which shows responsibility. Something every human being wants. but again he kept bringing up that I wanted certain things in the past when i\u2019m talking about now. \n\nAlso he\u2019s mentioned to me that if I don\u2019t do my part, he doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s fair to do his part and it\u2019s all situational. \n\nSo in other words: a mild case of tit for tat\u2026imo, idk.\n\nI just want to know if i\u2019m crazy and if this behavior is normal because this has been an ongoing issue for years. I feel like other couples i\u2019ve met have easier issues to deal with like infidelity. easiest problem to me to fix, you leave them. Point blank\u2026nothing complicated. I feel like my issue(s) with him is so complex and complicated that it\u2019s hard to believe there is a light at the end of the tunnel. please please I need to know what to make of this.\n\n\nThank you !\n\n(we plan to see a marriage counselor already so no need to suggest that )", "I\u2019ve made a Biblical timeline with movies that I\u2019ve recently watched (better than Games of Throne)Hey all, peace and blessings to whoever may read this.

Just recently, I ordered a copy of H.P. Lovecraft's horror stories because I've never read horror and wanted to give it a go. I'm Christian and live with very conservative parents who are strict about the kind of content me and my siblings consume, though since we're older now they've loosened up... a little bit. Just to give you a taste of their mindset: my family has never celebrated halloween because my parents think it's Satanic, depiction of skulls is also Satanic, and killing in games is also not good (I have played many games that have killing). I constantly hide the games that I play because my parents wouldn't approve of basically all of them (even Breath of the Wild, a rated E game, because it depicts monsters and killing. Imagine if they found out I'm playing Bloodborne!). You're probably wondering how my parents have no idea I'm playing these games - that's because my older brother (almost 30, living with me and my parents) is a heavy gamer, but my parents don't regulate his gameplay because they know he's an adult and they can't do anything about it. He plays a lot everyday and that's one of the reasons my parents are so wary of gaming. Anyway, I feel terrible about having to hide what I'm playing from my parents, but there's no way I'd be able to convince them that it's not bad to play horror or games that depict killing. Is it wrong for a Christians to play horror games and games that depict killing? I feel that the answer is no, unless they steer you away from God, which I have not felt. I just like scary stuff, but I don't know if it's wrong for a Christian to consume that kind of content.

It is about becoming better, and becoming better people together to build the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth.\n\nAs you can easily see by scrolling on this subreddit, it seems like most Non-Christians or deconstructing Christians see Christianity as mostly about how baddies go to hell, and being bad is basically just having sex with the wrong people. But then you read the Bible, and find out that hell is only physically described in one book, and mentioned incredibly vaguely everywhere else, and it seems like Jesus was more focused on helping people enter heaven than avoid hell (even if those two are obviously related). I would not be a Christian if the entire religion was just the assertion that an eternal hell exists and that an arbitrary book tells you the step by step process gets you our of it. For Christians and Atheists alike who think this is what the story is really about I beg you to actually read the New Testament. If you don't have the time, read After You Believe by N.T. Wright. \n\nFor people who struggle with the Bible's cosmological assertions, think about it like this. Imagine a world without any coherent morality (this is getting easier and easier every day I am afraid), this is what Hell is. People hurt each other, they hate each other, it is a dog eat dog world (Jesus describes hell frequently like the \"gnashing of teeth\") where everyone is playing their own game and trying to do what they want without consideration for anyone or anything else. Hell is the places in the universe that are totally separated from any morality. Without believing in miracles or even God, an atheist can recognize that the way out of a world without morality, is for individuals to begin to start making themselves good. One day we will all be perfect and evil will be destroyed. But we aren't perfect! Anyone can tell you that. Our errors and mistakes in this project of being good, still contribute to evil and still hurt people. The Christian Gospel is that so long as we are trying every day to get better and to do good, God forgives us for our mistakes.\n\nIf you want to do this without the moral code that God gave us (or even in a naturalist world view, was given to us by thousands of years of human moral development and which was the basis for all modern moral systems), and you would prefer that every human life was an indepedent game of atomized individuals deciding what is best for themselves, you will inevitably be less perfect than someone who is willing to ask for help and consult the sources.\n\nChristians are called to be good, and at the core of being good in the Christian world view is putting others before yourself (self-sacrifice). We are forgiven for making mistakes, as long as we keep the faith and don't give up. We believe the Creator of the Universe is helping us accomplish this goal because it mirrors His goals for Creation, but also allows us to have Free Will, as He does, because He does not want to control everything we do.\n\nIf you disagree with one of the moral rules in the Bible, I understand. I disagree, but I understand. It still might be a good book to read and be genuinely open to if you want to be a good person. If you have trouble with the harsh rules given to the Jews in the desert, then don't start there. Start with the New Testament and read what rules still mattered to the Early Church after Jesus's saving sacrifice for our forgiveness. Once we agree about those principles as a society, we can argue about the rules in Levitticus and Deuteronomy.", "What games are considered sinfulI play genshin and wild rift.

I\u2019m a painfully bad reader and I find podcasts quite dull but I notice I absorb information well from video.

While I don\u2019t have a denomination, I taught at and attended a Lutheran church for the past 6ish months. I would love to watch videos that are relatable to a 17 year old boy because I find it really hard to enjoy content talking about jobs and whatnot when I don\u2019t have one. A lot of Christian media is geared towards adults or really small children and I am neither but I do find the latter more interesting. I don\u2019t feel I can evens comprehend a lesson that tries to relate to various aspects of life like the taxes I don\u2019t pay, or the kids that I don\u2019t have, or the boss that I have yet to meet.

I am going to write out my story which will be very long and will have a lot of mentions of sex, violence, drug use and demonic possession. I thank all who read. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was born to a Jamaican immigrant family in Canada. My dad was a raging alcoholic and often beat me growing up. Some of my earliest memories are being punched or thrown into objects by the man. My mom would never do anything about it, she would just sit there silently and when we were alone she would allow me to cry. \n\nFor some reason, even at a very young age, I considered this to be very shameful and something to hide from people. I would often cover for my father by telling people that I got bruises from accidents and became a very natural liar. I felt like I had to hold this secret as deep as I possibly could and move forward with life. \n\nMy main friend growing up that I could confide in was JC, he was the only one I could tell about how I felt about my living situation. I always had a very close and personal relationship with Jesus Christ that has continued through my entire life, even as I delved deeper and deeper into sin. \n\nAll the lying I had done, had made me into a very gifted actor. As I grew older I got very into acting. My mom was supportive of my gift and would take me to auditions. From the age of 10, I have been in several commercials, TV shows and movies but never in a starring role. It was around this time, that I had my first beer. I took one from my father's beer fridge and drank it alone one night. After that night, I would do this more and more until I was taking 2-3 beers from his fridge. \n\nI started hanging out with a bad crew when I went to middle school. The type of kids to smoke weed and drink at an early age. I was already pretty tolerant of alcohol around this time and fit right in. The natural lying really came in handy during this period as I was able to become a chameleon and act sober and rational during class. I have no idea how, but I managed to be a fairly decent student during middle school and high school despite being high and sometimes drunk during most of the day. The only time I would not be high would be when I went for auditions or work. \n\nBy the time I graduated high school, I had tried pretty much every drug that you can think of except heroin, but my favourite was still weed and alcohol. \n\nI went to university almost entirely because I just wanted to go party like they do on the movies. I was still coming back to my hometown almost every week for work, but would spend every day at university drunk and high. I would spend every dollar I made buying alcohol, weed and fast food. I was really into women and had sex with hundreds during this period. Still I somehow did decent enough to get fairly ok grades. I still showed up for class and just put on my acting face and made it through and as soon as I left the room I was headed to grab a bottle. \n\nThe only reason I took university seriously is I thought it would be a dark stain against me when I hit my big break. I had a belief that I would become a huge Hollywood celebrity. One of the greatest actors of all time. Everyone around me except my father had told me that I was a very gifted and talented actor and I let this get to my head. It was what I lived for besides alcohol, drugs and sex. \n\nAfter I completed university, I still had not landed a starring role and my mother convinced me to do something else for the time being. I didn't want to do anything but acting but did not make enough money from it to feed my addiction and I was already several thousand dollars in debt. I decided on a complete whim to go to Teacher's College. \n\nI spent my time there the same as I had in grade school and university. Afterward, I applied also on a whim to be a teacher for dramatic arts at an opening in my home town. I somehow landed this job without hardly trying. I felt like this was also a sign of my greatness as I had landed a very desirable job while most of the people I went to college with had to move very far away from the city to land a role, but somehow I just fell into this role I did not even want long-term and just did for something to do. \n\nMy first day teaching, I was late. I didn't really care about the job and did it high the entire time. I had become such a natural at hiding that that not a single person has ever said anything to me about it. After work, if I didn't have an audition or job to do, I would spend the time getting high and drunk with my friends and chasing women. \n\nI got incredibly into debt because even my fairly high salary wasn't enough for me. I would spend more and more on fast food, alcohol, drugs and women. I took one woman to Mexico completely on me because I wanted to have sex with her for a week and drink. Literally, money was nothing to me because soon I was about to become a multimillionaire actor and money would no longer be a problem.\n\nLast year, my life changed when my debt became so overwhelming that I had to declare bankruptcy. It was really the first time I had ever faced poor consequences in my life. I had always just got what I want without really putting in any effort. This really awakened something in me. This is where my life would spiral down to the worst moments of my entire life in my year of hell.\n\nOne of my boys who I would get high and drink with every night had fallen into some circles online that had invested early in GameStop and he would tell us about it. He made a shit ton of money and convinced us that we would become insanely rich from investing in it as well. I had long suspected that the financial world was up to evil and these guys online were saying that they were going to topple them and expose their evil by buying GameStop stock which really spoke to me. I really wanted to be a hero and something great. \n\nI got increasingly into this and soon what we would do is get high and drunk and just talk about GameStop and the evil elites all night. I actually stopped going to auditions even, I started to think that I was not destined to become a Hollywood celebrity but a guide to topple the evil system. As we got more and more into this we started making connections between GameStop and some other prophecies like Nostradamus and the Mayans. I started to suspect that GameStop would become worth billions of dollars per share and would bring about the return of Christ on December 21, 2022. I posted about this on Reddit and some loser screencapped it and posted it on a subreddit dedicated to making fun of GameStop investors. \n\nThese people started harassing me daily and reading and posting my old posts on finance forums asking about bankruptcy and it really started to get to me. I really started to get angry and want to take personal vengenance on them. In doing so, I invited dark spirits into my life that I never had. \n\nI tried to talk to them reasonably but they would harass me daily, following me around and I started a war with them. I got more and more into it and would spend almost my entire day alone researching GameStop and later Bed Bath and Beyond and tracking these punks who would harass me and researching their connection to the evil force that I thought I was toppling. They kept egging me on and harassing me and getting off on my reaction. \n\nAs I was facing endless harassment, I began to hear voices speaking to me that I believed were God. I began to feel very horrible inside myself as I had so many conflicting and dark emotions in me. I realized later that I had been possessed by a demon. Several of the members of this subreddit were into the occult and one in particular had summoned a demon into me who I eventually stood up to and banished from my body. After this incident, I made my own subreddit and stopped engaging with them so they would leave me alone but still continued spending almost every day and night by myself or with my ex-gf researching GameStop and Bed Bath and Beyond and getting high and drunk.\n\nAs the date approached, I felt that Jesus was set to return and would make me a heavenly ruler on Earth. I had greater and greater belief that I was special and my ex really pumped me up for this as she studied demons and felt that it was the case. As I became more and more hopeful of my right to rule, I became cockier. At work, I started to slip and people were noticing.\n\nAt the beginning of this month, I made the biggest mistake of my life and told a student privately that I believe that Sikhs are devil worshippers and about my belief that the rapture was coming and I would become a heavenly Christian ruler. The principal found out and he asked me to return to my home for the day. A few hours later, I heard a knock at the door and it was the police. The principal had spoken with my mom and she had been very worried about my behaviour as well. I hid being an addict and being beaten for years without a single suspicion but my behaviour had become so erratic that everyone was now noticing. The police took me to the hospital and I was detained for over 3 weeks. \n\nStill even then, I believed that I was only being detained because of my belief and that they were trying to stop me. On Christmas, they let me go to my parents house on the agreement I would return the following day. I spent Christmas at my parents, went back the next morning and received the shock of my life. My doctor said that since I had behaved at my parents that they would let me go home with them if I would show up regularly to speak with the doctor. This absolutely shattered me. I thought that they would lock me up forever. I was honestly prepared to live there my entire life and now he was saying that I could actually leave and do what I want as long as I go back every now and then? I realized then that the dark spirits that I had invited had completely corrupted my thought process. I was the evil that I was trying to fight against. I was adding evil to the world. I let down my students and everyone around me. \n\nI am now home on my first morning back and reflecting. I haven't drank or smoked in 3 weeks. I am thinking very clearly for the first time. \n\nI am not going to go back to the school even if they will have me back which is doubtful. I could speak with the union and push it, but I never deserved that job to begin with.\n\nWhat I want to do now is create some sort of youth group that speaks with troubled at-risk kids like I was and helps them find the strength to deal with their problems and stay in God's path. Does something like this exist? I have long felt like church has really failed to reach out to the kids and thats why so many are turning away from it. I want to create a church that will help kids stay on this path and not live the way I did. \n\nShould I go to study the bible for some time and try to open something like this? How would I go about this? \n\nThank you so much for reading my story. God bless you and your families.

It seems odd as they are passed by people every single day that have plenty of resources to help them.  I don't know the individual struggles that lead them to live on the streets, but it's probably a combination of factors.  Drugs, alcohol, PTSD, lack of faith, disabilities, sexual abuse, loss of job, criminal histories preventing employment, and probably many other things I'm not thinking of at the moment.\n\nYet these people that are at their lowest levels in life, are passed daily by people in luxury vehicles with the means to help them.  We just get used to ignoring them and thinking that, \"it'll always be that way because they don't want to work.\"  What if all those affluent people in my city decided to get together and put together a team of care workers to get them set up for success?  Mental health counseling, drug/alcohol counseling, job placement, skills training, and employment opportunities for people with criminal histories.  Do these services exist currently?  Possibly.  Are they funded at the levels they should be to clear the streets of the people I passed the other day?  Absolutely not.  \n\nWhen people stop hoarding money and instead use it to serve others as God intended, this world will turn into the Garden of Eden.

While I was reading it I had a great fear and anxiety while going through Matthew. I was scared on the passage where it stated the example of \"lukewarm Christian\".\n\nI looked back in my life-I was born in a Christian household, however when it came to having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, I never really developed it. I spent most of my time studying and if not that, I played video games, watched anime, and read manga. And occasionally I did pray, but only at the beginning and the night time when I was going to sleep or getting ready for the day. However, this was mostly just to get through the day and mostly out of routine than genuine faith.\n\nWhen it came down to it, and I am ashamed to admit it, Jesus Christ wasn't a priority for me. I'd much rather watch anime and read manga than pray. I'd much rather waste away reading fan-fiction about things that weren't true than to spend my time reading the word of God. And I'd much rather spend my days fantasizing about characters that didn't even exist, with my own built in storylines in order to get over the hardships of real life.\n\nWhile the act of reading and watching anime/manga seems harmless, for me it was a downward spiral of sin and excess. I discovered hentai when I was 15 and gave me an addiction to pornography all the way through college and adulthood. I suffered from maladaptive daydreaming as I spent most times fantasizing about fiction, to the point where fantasy became my reality. I idolized them, the characters, I spent more time thinking about them more than I did about spending my time with God. I spent and incredible amount of time creating stories for these characters and looking up their wikis to find out the mythologies/lore of the setting. It had a strain on my mental health and the relationship I had with my family.\n\nMy mother, a woman who raised two kids on her own and the one who introduced me to Christ since I was young, realized that this was ruining my life. At that point, I was so deep into my own excess that I either ignored her or outright told her to \"Shut Up\". I spent a huge amount of time disrespecting her and had a huge amount of time reprising me for how I was wasting my life with what I was doing. At the time, I didn't care, I just shrugged it off and went on with indulging myself.\n\nThinking about my life at that point I realized, I had broken nearly-if not all 10 of the commandments. I worshiped and idolized fantasy to the point where it became my reality (1 and 2). I've taken the lord's name in vain too many times I can't even count (3). I kept no day holy as I was indulging myself in pornography nearly every day. (4) I disrespected my mother almost regularly, despite me knowing what she's done for me over the years. (5) I've had moments of anger and thoughts of violence. (6 and 10) I've committed adultery with the amount of pornographic images I've looked over gratifying myself.  (9) I've lied about others before.\n\nI called myself a Christian, while I haven't even once done anything to put Christ first. I realized that it wasn't too late for myself. I stopped reading porn, anime, and manga. This wasn't the first time I tried to stop either, however, as I went back to bad habits. While doing this, I felt a huge amount of fear and anxiety. I felt fear of God, and the possibility of eternal damnation. Anytime that I read about \"lukewarm\", \"weeping and gnashing of teeth\", I felt an immense fear that I honestly thought I was going crazy. I looked everywhere online on what I should do, whether it was \"okay\" to do certain habits and do this.\n\nIs this right? Should I be feeling this immense fear? Is this what faith is? To spend my entire life living in fear of eternal damnation all while reading the bible wondering what \"acts\" I should do so I can go to heaven, even if I know that only faith is salvation? What about all the others that love him? That say that they feel the \"love\" of Christ. When will I feel that? I've read the bible and kept my self-control for better part of 3 days and I still felt this incredible anxiety. It was a this moment that I wanted to die to see what my judgement was. I remembered it was around this time that I'd initially just snap and go back to my old ways again. To give in to self-indulgence and sin. To douse myself in fantasy and ignorance to keep myself blind from reality. And I wanted to.\n\nIt was at that moment, I had a realization. Like gears, my mind snapped into place. This overwhelming anxiety, this fear. A fear of giving up all the things that were holding me back. Like an addict, to keep the poison to help \"make life more bearable.\" It wasn't a fear of God, it was a fear of change. A fear of a life without my sins.\n\nI realize that in order for me to get closer to Jesus Christ, my savior, I need to get rid of all the things that will prevent my way to him. I deleted all my accounts associated with gaming, forum discussions, anime, and other things. I even deleted the email that was associated with them. I wanted nothing to do with that part of myself anymore. I no longer want to keep myself in those bad habits. To have an obstacle to prevent me from Christ.\n\nI'm writing this not to gain some new attention, but as a warning. While it may seem benevolent, a lot of anime and manga do not really have any associations for God, in fact, it tends to be the opposite. Since they're made by Japan, they've mostly been associated with Shintoistic beliefs. And more often than not, they mostly use the idea of demons in a more benevolent light. Depending on the anime, they of course also have adult content and themes. It can also lead to a gateway to a lot more \"explicit\" scenes. I will even go on record and say that it is \"unholy\", and I don't care if you make fun of me for it.\n\nIt doesn't have to be just anime either. Is there something in your life that you feel you can't live without? That you spend more time thinking about than Jesus Christ? Something that you always think about instead of God? If so, you should \"cut\" that part away from you and cast into the fire, else your body be burned also.\n\nWe all have our cross to bear in life, sins that we want to go back to, but know we can't and shouldn't. I prey that I can hold mine properly.\n\nI had this realization an hour ago. Please pray for me.", "Let\u2019s put it to the test: Colossians Chapter 2:14-16Shabbat shalom everyone! Today I\u2019m continuing the most important lesson ever. Many say that Yeshua abolished the Mosaic Law, and that the Old Testament is long gone and obsolete. Is the Law and the Prophets abolished? Let\u2019s put the some of the writings of the New Testament to the test of the Law the Prophets.\n\nLast week we learned that we do things God\u2019s way because of the [Blessings and the Curses](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganNazarite/comments/10bped5/a_case_for_legalism/). That we are blessed by following God\u2019s ways as described in the Torah, and that we are cursed if we add traditions of men or worship Father with the ways of the world. Now that we established that foundation, let\u2019s continue. So far, we can see that looking at the New Testament writings with the lens of the Torah, that the verses become clearer and there are no contradictions. Here is the score far:\n\nThe Torah:3\n\nDoctrines of Devils:0\n\nSo far there is no contest! In the words of the good old hockey game, it\u2019s a shutout! Can we score another goal? Let\u2019s keep sharpening our proverbial spears and swords, which is the Word. WMC no. 4 is Colossians 2:14-16 . Did Paul really say that the Torah was nailed to the cross in Colossians 2:14? When I was in college, a wise teacher told us students that, during exams students should read the whole question before answering. The bible is the same. For a student of the scriptures to understand, a student needs to read the whole thing.\n\nColossians Chapter2\n\nFor I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; \\[2\\] That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; \\[3\\] In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. \\[4\\] And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. \\[5\\] For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. \\[6\\] As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: \\[7\\] Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. \\[8\\] Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. \\[9\\] For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. \\[10\\] And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power: \\[11\\] In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: \\[12\\] Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. \\[13\\] And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; \\[14\\] Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; \\[15\\] And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. \\[16\\] Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: \\[17\\] Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. \\[18\\] Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, \\[19\\] And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God. \\[20\\] Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, \\[21\\] (Touch not; taste not; handle not; \\[22\\] Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men? \\[23\\] Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.\n\nPaul starts Colossians chapter 2 saying that he is worried about them, and he wishes that he may be there with them to comfort them and to feed them with the knowledge of Father. We then know why he is worried in verse 4. Paul is worried that some persons may come and charm them away with tempting words to lead them away from Yeshua. In the first century assemblies, it was war! The apostles and their followers were teaching the new followers of Yeshua to keep to the Torah and drop the traditions of men, and the Pharisees would try to get them back by saying that they had to do it their way for them to be saved. Sound familiar, that the same thing that many churches say today. That followers have to do it their way, else they can never be saved.\n\nHe then reminds them in verse 6 that they need to go back to what they were taught when they received Yeshua. In verse 7 Paul reminds them to go back to the teachings of Yeshua, and keep thanking the Father in all they do. In verse 8 he then tells the followers in Colossae what is his concern and warns them not to be spoiled through philosophy and deceit, after traditions of men, and things of the world, and not after Yeshua\u2019s teachings. He then continues and says that Yeshua\u2019s teachings are the fullness of God Himself.\n\nWhich ordinances were nailed to the cross in verse 14? They were the ordinances of men and things of the world. As Paul warned them in verse 8. Yeshua triumphed over those ordinances of men because Yeshua rose from the grave even after teaching his disciples not to do the teachings of the Pharisees. In other words, Yeshua never did the traditions of the Pharisees yet Yeshua rose from the dead anyway, proving that there was no power in the teachings of the scribes and Pharisees and that they were vain teachings.\n\nDoes Paul abolish the shabbat and feast days in verse 16? No way! Just the fact that he mentions them is proof in itself, but rather Paul states \u201cLet no man judge you\u201d how to do and celebrate them. Again, the scribe and Pharisees had added a whole host of traditions associated with the shabbat, and the feast days and which foods and drinks could be consumed. And those traditions were all added to the Torah. Paul was preaching the Torah without the added traditions of the scribes and Pharisees! The same as Yeshua preached. Yes, the feast days are a shadow, because there is exactly 40 weeks (the gestational period of a child born of a woman) between the first feast day (Passover) and the last day of Sukkot (feast of Booths); the feast days every year point to the birth of a man! Which is Yeshua the messiah! HalleuYAH!\n\nThen in verse 20 Paul states that as a follower of Yeshua, a believer is dead to the world, why then do they (the Colossians) do the traditions of the world even if those traditions will cease? Then in verse 20 and 21 he again warns them not to taste or handle the traditions and doctrines of men because those who do will perish, as will the doctrines themselves.\n\nLet\u2019s go to the words of Yeshua at Matt 23:1-4\n\n\\[1\\] Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, \\[2\\] Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: \\[3\\] All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. \\[4\\] For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.\n\nPaul preached the same as Yeshua in his teachings. In verse 3 Yeshua teaches his disciples to do what the Pharisees say. Why does Yeshua say this? Yeshua is referring to the readings of the Torah that was read in the synagogue every Shabbat by the scribes and Pharisees. Then he says don\u2019t do what they do, because they added traditions on men\u2019s shoulders that have nothing to do with the torah. And that they themselves don\u2019t even do them. That\u2019s why Yeshua says do what they say, but not what they do. Do the commands in the Torah, but not the added traditions.\n\nAre the feast days really abolished? Let\u2019s go to the prophet Isaiah at 66:22-24.\n\n\\[22\\] For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. \\[23\\] And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD. \\[24\\] And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.\n\nAfter Yeshua\u2019s return, they that remain standing will come before Yeshua, every Shabbat and every new moon to come worship before him. Do you really think that Shabbat will be any day of the week? Will your be standing? Or will you be a carcase? Only you can decide.\n\nDon\u2019t take it from me! Prove all things and judge for yourself. Let the spirit lead you where it wants you to be.\n\nYeshua is our master, savior and rabbi, we need no other man to lead us!\n\nShalom, VN", "one of my fav street preachers livestreaming at the Nebraska game", "Is gambling a sin?Recently I have become interested in games such as poker, blackjack, and texas hold'em, I find their mechanics kinda interesting.

Some of my friends are atheists, but they are interested in learning about my faith. I wasn't trying to convert them or anything like that, we were just discussing our beliefs. Anyway, my mom had heard our conversation from her room, and so she asked me about it the next day while we were eating. I told her that I was talking about my faith in God with my friends and we were having quite a deep conversation. My mom then asked me why I believed in God so much, because apparently she had no idea that I was a believer. My grandma is a Christian, and she asked if I was a Christiam because my grandma told me to be one. While I take inspiration from my grandma, as she is an amazing and loving woman, she is not the main reason why I am Christian. I explained to my mom that I've always believed in God and that I want to live my life as God wants me to. She then asked if I also believe in Heaven and Hell. I told her I do. She got a frown on her face and expressed her disapproval of my belief. She believes in reincarnation, which I respect and have always respected. But her disrespect towards my belief in Heaven and Hell hurt me. I explained to her that I've always believed in this, and she and her boyfriend (not my father) started talking and making me feel foolish for my belief. At this point, I had had tears building up in my eyes for some time, since I was very upset at their disrespect of my faith in God. Finally, she asked me if I wanted to read the Bible and things like that, and I told her that yes, at some point I'd love to read the Bible. She told me that she's very surprised that I'm so religious, and she told me she wants me to have more of an open mind instead of abiding my the rules of a book. Here, I started crying, and I can'g even remember the last time I cried before this. She and her boyfriend had hurt me deeply and made me feel foolish. Thankfully, she realized she had made a mistake in how she went about the conversation, and she apologized. It took me a little bit of time to be able to forgive her, but I did eventually. We hugged and she told me she's sorry and she loves me no matter what I believe, and I said the same. In the end, my faith in God has actually grown stronger, and I feel more connected with Him. I've totally forgiven my mom, and I just wanted to share this story with you all to give an example of how your faith can grow through sad and disappointing events, and that everything will turn out good for you in the end!", "Is there any guidance in the Bible for learning to ask for/accept help?This is a bit long but I wanted to include backstory\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve never been to church and I\u2019ve wanted to go for a while now. I was not raised religious but started reading the Bible and trying to grow my faith in 2019 or so. There\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t understand and surely listening to sermons rather than just reading would be beneficial.\n\nI also think church would be good for me for other reasons. My mother has warned me about church people being overbearing but I don\u2019t think she understands how alone I am. She nor my dad ever have. I was homeschooled and totally isolated, I haven\u2019t been around anyone my own age (or anyone besides my parents in general, really) since I was 12. I\u2019m now 23. I\u2019m ready to meet people and actually be a part of a community. I always see that the churches here have things going on - charity, volunteering opportunities, fun things like game nights and ice cream socials. I\u2019m always so sad I\u2019m an outsider. That was overwhelmingly the emotion I felt when places here had virtual church and I\u2019d tune in. I was nonexistent, just like I always have been, only I got to see what I was missing out on every week. That\u2019s why I was only kind of sad when they stopped live-streaming.\n\nI once posted anonymously in my town FB group asking what the options for getting to church are since I can\u2019t drive and I see buses sometimes but I\u2019m not sure how to actually arrange to be picked up and I was flooded with comments. Not only about the actual bus options but random people offering to give me a ride. It was super overwhelming and I still don\u2019t know how to feel about it, months later. I don\u2019t want to burden and impose on anyone, including the buses. \n\nThis was probably a year ago and I still think about it sometimes. That\u2019s probably a sign, right? God\u2019s trying to tell me something? I\u2019m torn. I am tired of being stuck in a house mostly alone, but also can\u2019t allow myself to do the one thing to remedy this which is to let others help. \n\nI\u2019ve realized though many, many other things that asking for or accepting help are just about impossible for me. What are some relevant Bible passages for this??", "How I Met Jesus and Opened My Third Eye To The Spirit RealmHow I Met Jesus and Opened My Third Eye To The Spirit Realm\n\nLast year, I was in the shower, asking myself the real questions about my life. I wanted to know why I was addicted to weed, alcohol, video games, fast food, and pornography. Why was I addicted to my own self-destruction?\n\nMeaning every word from my heart, I asked Thoth for help to fix my life, and said aloud in my shower, \"Thoth? If you are real, I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't want to die yet.\"\n\nThen, my hand moved on its own from the side of my body, to my forehead and then to my heart, while holding a handsign, and I felt at peace.\n\nI dried off, went to my bed room, got dressed, and then went to my full body mirror, an inherited mirror from my Grandma who passed away, and I said, \"Thoth? This is not who I want to be. Will you help me?\" And I dragged my hand down the mirror across my face and body and closed my eyes.\n\nThen, I saw a vivid image of Jesus appear in my mind. He had a beard, and long hair. The left half of his face was illuminated, the right in shadow and darkness.\n\nAt first, when he started to fade in, I didn't even know what was happening at first, so I opened my eyes for a second to see if he would fade away, and he did a bit, so I closed my eyes shut. I didn't even realize it was Jesus until after about ten seconds had passed.\n\nHe remained in my field of view even when I opened my eyes, I tested it while he was in full focus. It was like his image was imprinted on my mind for thirty seconds.\n\nI believe Jesus interceded for me, even though I asked Thoth because he knew I needed him. I also think he came to help me because I finally turned my heart away from my evil and sinful ways.\n\nToward the end of the image, when Jesus was in full focus, I remember reaching out to him with hands in my mind, like I didn't want him to leave, and he drifted away.\n\nLater that night, at bed time, I was using a meditation technique of fixing my emotional state by welcoming in my negative emotions, instead of pushing them away, or bottling them up. I would say, \"I am afraid, I am not afraid, I am afraid, welcome fear.\" Then, I would hug myself, ans welcome the anxiety, instead of pushing it away.\n\nAfterwards, I was also contemplating the nature of good and evil, and was trying to decide if evil could be looked at with compassion, instead of hatred, and that's when I felt a slight pop in my head, near my pineal gland, and fluid started flowing from the left hemisphere of my brain, to the right. I had been listening to a lot of hemisync music before this happened.\n\nThe process didn't hurt at all, in fact, it was relaxing, and then I saw a vivid image of God and the Satan dancing together. God had blonde hair, and a white flowing robe, with the classic Jesus sandals, and Satan was a red demon with horns, and a spiked tail. I recognized God doing the Russian squat dance. God and Satan looked happy dancing together.\n\nAfter the fluid transfer was done, I felt like I had been living in half my brain my whole life. Like I wasn't connected to my emotional self at all.\n\nThen, I went through a dark night of the soul where I cried more than I ever have. I cried for the damage I have done to my friends and family by being spiritually asleep, and selfish. I cried for all the hurt I have put on my body by smoking weed and cigarettes, and drinking alcohol every night, and just sitting in front of my computer playing video games all day.\n\nI cried for the Earth too, and all the damage we have done as a species. I cried for all the dead from wars. I cried for my grandparents. I cried for my Sister, and for all the other mentally disabled people in the world. I cried for a lot of reasons. I also cried because my Grandma died of alcoholism, and I contributed to her death by buying her alcohol.\n\nThen, I went back to my bedroom, and learned through a flash of divine revelation that the living God of the Universe is real, and I was afraid. I could feel their eyes on me, and I panicked. It was learning that I'm on stage and my life is a divine drama that freaked me out a lot too.\n\nMy body felt like it was dying from the fear, and I was gasping for air until I laid on my bed, and my entire body tingled. I stopped breathing for a couple minutes, and urinated, and I thought, my end is near. I believe this was Satan pulling out my life force energy. The experience makes me think of a Dementor from Harry Potter.\n\nThen, I turned my head and saw the Easter Lily that I had bought earlier that day while I was with my Mom and Sister at the store. I had placed it on my computer desk. \n\nI knew looking at that beautiful flower I wanted to live more than anything, and I gasped for air, since I had been holding it to beyond the fear point, and I vaulted out of my bed.\n\nThat is when I fully had the ability to hear the voices of God and Jesus, Thoth, and Satan and his demons, but there was so much chaos. \n\nI didn't know who was speaking. I only heard comforting and reassuring voices, and anxiety and fear filling voices. I remember hearing someone plead saying, \"Please! Help him! He is so confused!\" I think this may have been one of my grandparents that I heard, I'll know on the other side.\n\nI was panicking a lot, and my mind was very chaotic, and Satan tricked me into thinking I had to die in order to reincarnate, so I went face down in my pillow in my bed, and held my breath to beyond the fear point.\n\nMy body was writhing in fear, and wanted air, and then I saw a red V shaped triangle with circles on each point, possibly the unholy trinity, and I heard, \"Don't worry,\" and then \"We are trying to sync up with you,\" and I recoiled from the pillow gasping for air. I believe now the \"Don't worry,\" came from Jesus, the rest was Satan or his demons.\n\nI looked up and out the window in a panic, and asked for anyone to please help me, and I heard, \"It's okay Adam, help is on the way,\" and I leapt from my bed gasping for air, and began pacing in my room, trying to catch my breath. I must have been close to fainting a dozen times.\n\nThat's when, I saw vivid images of characters that I love. Aang from Avatar the Last Airbender, Master Yoda from Star Wars, and Neo from The Matrix. I think these were the archetypes I mentally aspired to be like, coming to the forefront. I also heard, \"The brain is a processor.\"\n\nThat is when I was told I need to soak my head in a bowl of ice water to keep my brain cooled because there is so much activity, like an overheating computer.\n\nI could physically feel my third eye in my head, and my reptilian brain was wiggling on its own. I could also feel a very concerning ballooning sensation on the far right side of my head by my temple.\n\nThis worried me the most, so I kept my right hemisphere in the water most of the time. I think we were creating a pressure differential on my brain so fluid could transfer more easily between the hemispheres.\n\nI went through three days and nights of soaking my head in ice water listening to voices that were helpful and comforting, and others that caused fear and anxiety. I didn't sleep, and barely ate anything.\n\nOne of the days that I was soaking my head, I had my right hemisphere in the water, and I was exhaling hard out from my nose, and a bunch of white viscous fluid started coming out, and my brain cleared up.\n\nI had full clarity, and went outside. I was walking around swinging a stick like a sword, but then I could feel fluid building up in my left hemisphere again, and had to soak my head in a puddle of water to keep it cool.\n\nThe next day I was listening to the friendly voice's guidance, which i realize now was God or Jesus, and they had me leave my house, and sit by a tree.\n\nWhile I was there, two women approached me and shared the gospel message with me. I knew that it was a divine appointment, and I called one of their husband's right away, and joined their house church.\n\nI went back home, and went back into the basement, and kept soaking my head. I was clutching my celtic cross necklace too, and I must have went to the fear break point hundreds of times while holding my breath in the water, letting my body writhe in the agony and fear, and facing it head on. It was like we had to drive all the fear out of my flesh.\n\nBy the end of it all, the devil had me try to take my life, because he had me convinced that if I popped my pineal gland, and died, the world would be reborn anew from suffering.\n\nIn my dark basement, in the dead of night, soaked in cold water and shivering, I pressed a wooden staff I had been carrying, as hard as I could into the center of my forehead, ready to die for my Mom and Sister, and faced my fear so everyone could be free.\n\nI pushed as hard as I could until my arms gave out, but the skull is very strong. That night, the devil also wanted me to put wooden stakes through my hands like Jesus, but I couldn't do that either. I remember giving up after three days of the torment, and I fell asleep almost instantly. I only rested for a few hours though.\n\nThe next day, I remember I was sitting in the backyard in my shed, trying to keep my mind still with my right hemisphere soaked in water to keep my brain from ballooning, and when my Mom came to check on me, and I had her call the paramedics because I wanted to live.\n\nThey took me to the hospital where I recovered from some of my injuries. They transferred me to a mental health clinic, but unfortunately, they don't really know what is going on at a spiritual level, so all they can do is make people comfortable, and give people a place to rest.\n\nWhile I was there, a fellow patient was suffering from what I now believe were demons. He would randomly shout and scream in agony on the floor, and then be okay in five minutes, walking around as if nothing happened. One of the other patients said to me that he must he tormented by somethibg.\n\nThe interesting part is that he would call me Jesus as we passed in the halls. Almost as if he could sense the Spirit of Jesus with me.\n\nI had a moment where I sat down with him and wrote out some of the things he wanted to accomplish in his life. Something the staff wasn't trying to do.\n\nIt also seems sad to me that during my time there, they never sat me down with a therapist or a psychologist. It was basically just a warehouse for people to stay for up to a couple weeks. I have since been to two mental health facilities, and they were both very similar. The entire burden is placed on the nurses, and there are no psychologists or therapists.\n\nAnyways, that was last year around the time of the passover, that this all happened, and since then I have gained more mastery over my brain, I don't have to soak my head, and can physically open my third eye. I can feel it opening.\n\nI'm not talking about putting pressure on my forehead. I mean I can control the mechanism that can open the third eye, and it's connected to two tubes on either side which connect into the brain, I can feel them afterwards when I press hard on the area.\n\nI believe one of its primary purposes is to push away demons, and I also have a feeling it has more purposes too that have yet to be discovered.\n\nHowever, the primary reason I think, is this is the way God and Jesus renew the mind when you're born again.\n\nIf you look at the painting in the Sistine Chapel of God reaching out to Adam, God is sitting on a human brain, and God's throne is the third eye, the pineal gland, or the hippocampus area.\n\nAnyways, there is more I could write, but I will leave it at that for now.

These are a few quotations from his last speech that summarise his views on various social topics: \n\n\"***In the name of God, I ask financial groups and international credit institutions to allow poor countries to assure \u201cthe basic needs of their people\u201d and to cancel those debts that so often are contracted against the interests of those same peoples. In the name of God, I ask the great extractive industries -- mining, oil, forestry, real estate, agribusiness -- to stop destroying forests, wetlands and mountains, to stop polluting rivers and seas, to stop poisoning food and people. In the name of God, I ask the great food corporations to stop imposing monopolistic systems of production and distribution that inflate prices and end up withholding bread from the hungry. In the name of God, I ask arms manufacturers and dealers to completely stop their activity, because it foments violence and war, it contributes to those awful geopolitical games which cost millions of lives displaced and millions dead. In the name of God, I ask the technology giants to stop exploiting human weakness, people\u2019s vulnerability, for the sake of profits without caring about the spread of hate speech, grooming, fake news, conspiracy theories, and political manipulation. In the name of God, I ask the telecommunications giants to ease access to educational material and connectivity for teachers via the internet so that poor children can be educated even under quarantine. In the name of God, I ask the media to stop the logic of post-truth, disinformation, defamation, slander and the unhealthy attraction to dirt and scandal, and to contribute to human fraternity and empathy with those who are most deeply damaged. In the name of God, I call on powerful countries to stop aggression, blockades and unilateral sanctions against any country anywhere on earth. No to neo-colonialism. Conflicts must be resolved in multilateral fora such as the United Nations. We have already seen how unilateral interventions, invasions and occupations end up; even if they are justified by noble motives and fine words. This system, with its relentless logic of profit, is escaping all human control. It is time to slow the locomotive down, an out-of-control locomotive hurtling towards the abyss. There is still time***.\"(Paragraph 2) \n\n\"***Let us dream together, dream among yourselves, dream with others.

Dreams transcend the narrow limits imposed on us and suggest possible new worlds to us.

This is the distortion that provokes the depressive hedonism that is meant to neutralise the transformative power that people possess, and in particular young people. Do you know what comes to mind now when, together with popular movements, I think of the Good Samaritan? Do you know what comes to mind? The protests over the death of George Floyd. It is clear that this type of reaction against social, racial or macho injustice can be manipulated or exploited by political machinations or whatever, but the main thing is that, in that protest against this death, there was the Collective Samaritan who is no fool! This movement did not pass by on the other side of the road when it saw the injury to human dignity caused by an abuse of power. The popular movements are not only social poets but also collective Samaritans. In these processes, there are many young people who feel hope, but there are many other young people who are sad, who perhaps in order to feel something in this world need to resort to the cheap consolations offered by the consumerist and narcotising system....What you do is very important, but it is also important that you succeed in transmitting to present and future generations the same thing that inflames your hearts. In this you have a dual task or responsibility. Like the Good Samaritan, to tend attentively to all those who are stricken along the way, and at the same time, to ensure that many more join in: the poor and the oppressed of the earth deserve it, and our common home demands it of us.***\"(Paragraph 3) \n\n\"***Together with the poor of the earth, I wish to ask governments in general, politicians of all parties, to represent their people and to work for the common good. I want to ask them for the courage to look at their own people, to look people in the eye, and the courage to know that the good of a people is much more than a consensus between parties. Let them stop listening exclusively to the economic elites, who so often spout superficial ideologies that ignore humanity's real dilemmas.

Let us build bridges of love so that the voices of the periphery with their weeping, but also with their singing and joy, provoke not fear but empathy in the rest of society. And so, I persist in my pestering. It is necessary to confront together the populist discourses of intolerance, xenophobia, and aporophobia, which is hatred of the poor.

I am not sure how to answer it's last question. Would anyone like to help or should I try r/ChatGPT?\n\nCopy of conversation with ChatGPT:\n\nMe: Do you know the Golden Rule?\n\nChatGPT: Yes, I am familiar with the Golden Rule. It is a principle that states \"treat others as you would like to be treated\". The idea of the Golden Rule has been expressed by many cultures and religious traditions throughout history in various forms.\n\nMe: Are you familiar with \"do unto others as they do unto me\"?\n\nChatGPT: Yes, I am familiar with the variation of the Golden Rule you mentioned. \"Do unto others as they do unto me\" is sometimes referred to as the \"Silver Rule.\" While it is similar to the Golden Rule in that it encourages treating others with respect and fairness, it can be seen as a more defensive or reactive approach, as opposed to the proactive, empathetic stance of the Golden Rule.\n\nMe: I refer to  that rule as the \"Pyrite Rule\". Do you know what pyrite is?\n\nChatGPT: Yes, I am familiar with pyrite. Pyrite is a mineral also known as iron sulfide or \"fool's gold.\" It is so named because it has a bright metallic luster that can be mistaken for gold, but it is not as valuable or valuable in different ways. The term \"Pyrite Rule\" is a play on the word \"pyrite\" and the idea of the \"Silver Rule.\" By using this term, you may be suggesting that this variation of the Golden Rule is not as valuable or effective as the original principle.\n\nMe: Is there a way to simulate the a population practicing these rules?\n\nChatGPT: Simulating a population that practices either the Golden Rule or the \"do unto others as they do unto me\" rule can be done using various methods such as computer simulations, game theory models, or mathematical models. These simulations can help explore how a population would behave if these principles were followed and can provide insights into the outcomes and consequences of such behavior. The specific approach used would depend on the goals and objectives of the simulation, as well as the level of detail and complexity desired.\n\nMe: Can you help me program such a model?\n\nChatGPT: Yes, I can help you program such a model. There are several ways to approach this problem, and the choice of approach will depend on the specific requirements of your model. You could consider using agent-based modeling, which simulates the actions and interactions of individual agents within a population. Another approach could be to use game theory to model the behavior of the population. Depending on the specifics of your model, it may also be possible to use mathematical or statistical models.\n\nIn any case, I would recommend starting with a clear definition of the problem you are trying to solve, and the specific questions you want your simulation to answer. This will help guide the choice of methodology and ensure that the model is well-suited to the problem at hand.", "So on 3am this morning I woke up, I asked God to forgive me for not praying all day and to let me have a long life & do the things I want (like watch anime,play games, watch movies etc).

That\u2019s the great Latin heresy of the West that denies both the Trinity and the full divinity of Christ. Jesus clearly tells us His Father would never leave Him alone. In asking \u201cWhy have you forsaken Me\u201d on the cross, Jesus was fully empathizing with our broken sense of human estrangement, asking \u201cour\u201d blinded, alienated question \u201cWhy?\u201d when we feel forsaken by a Father who never abandons anyone. He displays and enacts the Father\u2019s mercy; He doesn\u2019t buy the Father off. The Father looks just like the Son, and didn\u2019t need to be legally conditioned to love you. Contrary to popular opinion, God was never a legalist - that was always man\u2019s religious game.\nThe obvious question that always follows is this: \u201cWhat then is the point of the cross?\u201d And the answer is quite obvious as well.

Thank you :D \n\nSo, since I was young, Ive loved action movies. I don't mean movies that glorify evil or contain adult scenes (If there's only a bit, because I'm now 20 and mature, I skip it), vulgar language, and needless gore. I mean good fighting evil. Justice being done (I include vigilante movies in this because, although technically illegal in the movie's universe, its usually good HAVING to be done because the ones meant to be doing the justice are letting evil happen; like \"The Equaliser\"). I don't watch horror movies because they typically involve demonic stuff that never seems to be conquered. I watch Sci-Fi \"Horror\" like \"Alien\" sometimes but, even then, I dislike the gore. And finally, I like movies, occasionally, like American Gangster. Not because it glorifies that life, but because it does the opposite. It shows its true vile reality. At the end, the main character ends up alone at the bottom. I just like adventure, story, reality, and bad guys getting whooped. \nSince I was about 15 I've been a CoD player. Campaign for the story line, online for the skill, and VERY occasionally zombies for some stupid fun.\nHowever, I've seen some Christians quote some verses that make me think. I'll quote the verses and then give my thoughts. Let me know yours! \n\n\"I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.\" Psalm 101:3 KJV - I have no idea. Id need to study the context. \n\n\"Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.\" Psalm 141:4 KJV - I think this means like actually wanting to harm someone for evil, or steal, kill, etc. \n\n\"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\" Philippians 4:8 KJV - Again, I'd need to study the context. \n\nI don't want to harm anyone, and find little pleasure in worldy activities. The one's my flesh finds pleasure in, my spirit combats them and has a hatred for them. I've just always loved justice. In playing games like CoD or Battlefield, you play a hero (Not so much in multiplayer, its more like airsoft). As a man, I'm drawn to the strength of bravery, and there are few situations where you have to be braver than in war. Unfortunately, as shown in games and film, war has grim reality, but that's what it is: reality. And with movies like \"American Gangster\" I see it as story telling. A window into another life. And, no surprise, everytime I watch a movie like that, I feel a deep gratitude to the Lord that He kept me from such a life. A point I could see, however, is that by playing CoD etc, you trivialise the brutality and sacrifice in war. Just a thought. \n\nId like to finish by saying that, to those who say, \"You're obviously convicted. Follow those convictions.\", I have a serious problem with second guessing myself and overthinking. I've even been diagnosed \"OCD traits - Perfectionist tendencies\" so please do not immediately tell me to follow my convictions, or be legalistic, or aggressive. Ive come across MANY Christians on Reddit who are aggressive. They say things like \"Sounds like you're just trying to justify your sin. Sin is NEVER right in the eyes of Almighty God!!!\" That aggression just stresses me out. Please answer calmly. \n\nThank you very much, brothers and sisters. \n\nGod bless", "It's hard to love everyone. With Christ it gets easier.Let all that you do be done in love.\n1 Corinthians 16:14 \n\nEasier said than done when others are not doing the same.  Some people will genuinely not like you.  Sometimes your actions will cause them to feel this way, and they aren't willing to forgive. Other times, they don't have a reason.\n\nSome people might be caught up in their mind with their own problems, keeping them from coming across as loving.\n\nYou have the choice of putting all of that aside and living a life of love or allowing yourself to succumb to your surroundings.\n\nI personally couldn't do it on my own.  I tried, I hung in there for a long time, but I kept it inside and went off like an atomic bomb.  Accepting Christ as my Savior was the game changer.

Every time i cry for Him or cry because i pour my heart to Him but when He offers me salvation and repentance i say something like please not now God i'm not ready...\nThe worst part is that some part sadly a big part of me is laughing like oh a bit more time and excuses. It actually sickens me. \n\nThe only Hope i have is that God is patient with me to repent and that i will not be like the Rich fool but i guess i am like that too. I can't stand being alone and mostly avoid Him by watching TV which became an addiction and even using my loving grandma to hide from God. By doing this i'm treating both God and her worse than Judas. He betrayed Him for 30 pieces of silver i betray, dishonor and basically spit at His face every single day for free. \n\nImagine this there is a dirty tent there is a cross where in front of it but you have to take about half an hour to get there. Its like Jesus every single day Takes me out of there and we walk for like 15-20 minutes but when i see we are getting close i push Him off even when He is so kind and patient with me (if He isn't sick of me already,i Hope i havent truly rejected Him and hopefully that will never EVER happen) and run back to my tent. I always hear something like please your salvation is just there like Jesus talks to me and i just cover my ears like a filthy little monster that i am, i build a wall even stronger than the one He Had destroyed before and then cry like a little rat is it too late and hide behind self pity. I just have to Hope that the Holy Spirit will not give up on me... Because i resist Him every single day and then cry when i get what i deserve.\n\nI am a psychopath and a narcissist and feel like i automatically resist Him which really makes me think if i havent rejected Him i Hope not because i'm writing this. I'm scared to admit my sin and sincerely repent and put my faith in Christ because i'm a piece of garbage and my deeds are evil. \n\nIts like Christ said lest they turn to me so that i will heal them and when Jesus wept about how many times Jesus wanted to gather Israel under His wing yet they refused but i dont want to reject Him yet i'm sick in the head I GENUINELY AM and i'm playing this sick little game like a monster.\n\nTHAT IS WHY I WRITE EVERY SINGLE DAY BECAUSE I JUST HOPE THAT THE SPARK IS STILL THERE, THE HOPE, THE WILL TO REPENT...\n\nNow i understand why it is said to avoid the unrepentant, the worst kind of sinner.

If i could go back in time i would most likely kill my younger self so that He will not hurt God this badly and become the wretched piece of crap that i am today.\n\nI Hope that there is still Hope..that's all i can say in this state. I basically am an abomination to Him and i'm basically the combination of the things He Hates.\n\nI have to just beg Him to give me time, that He will not remove Himself from me until i turn to Him for salvation. That He would not let me Die in the wilderness and give me over to a reprobate mind.\n\nI just want to laugh at how stupid i am. I'm saying these things yet even right now I hide from His salvation.\n\nI want to choose love and light and to stop hurting others yet i choose darkness, stubborness and cold heart because my deeds are evil and i'm scared to reveal them and turn from them. \nThat is all i have that God despite all of this will not let me go and help me get back so that i wont end up being completely against Him.

I am also in a good place today.\n\nHowever, a lot of this has been on the back of my mother. She's been teaching me the Bible and about God every day since I could remember. My dad in comparison, didn't do anything. He drove the family to church and that was about it. It was and is really hard for me to acknowledge that I have no real male role model. I could never ask my dad about if he dealt with pornography and if he successfully dealt with it. I could never ask him questions that I would have that would be unsuited to asking my mother.\n\nThis extends into my secular relationship with him. Every since I could remember I tried to get him to play with me, but he wasn't interested because he was too busy watching TV. For years I tried to please him by exercising in the living room where he was (he's big into bodybuilding) but he never really gave me advice or motivated me, just watched TV and told me what to do next. I kept trying to get him to do stuff with me but nothing worked. I eventually stopped. The kicker was that I had no choice in forcibly spending time with him by going out to the park as 'Family Time'. It's a blessing that a family could go to the park every week but as a child who wants their dad to notice them, it felt like I wasn't going because he loved me but because he wanted to show off his family on Facebook. My sisters and I were visibly upset in every picture we took because it was never about us but about him. He never asked us if we wanted to go, rather we were told to get dressed and we would have no indication when we would go home (generally lasting up for 3-4 hours). Eventually as my sisters and I got older je lost total influence and couldn't force us outside. Only until I was older like 19 I decided to try talking to him again in the hopes of building a relationship in which I was noticed. I got into chess which he was into as well. We played about 2 games. And then every time I asked him he was too busy - TV again. It was a direct repeat of my childhood. I got into history (even majored in it) and he was into history as well. But he never showed interest in my German history interests rather he called it a 'phase' followed up by how great Romania is and why they're the best country that nobody wants to admit because of a global conspiracy (this is called Protochronism). I tried to get into football because I knew he watched it a lot on TV, but he never invited me to watch with him. He was happy when I asked but he never asked me - a repeat of my teenage years when it was about his enjoyment, not mine. And right now I've been getting into cars and hoping he would talk about them with me, but nothing. I asked him about cars, didn't really show an interest in my opinions and left. So I don't know what to do. Do I confront my dad about everything I just said? Or do I just accept this is the way things are and become something of a Timothy?", "Rare February rain todayIt turned put to be a good day afterall. Just based off of the weather, pleasant surprise. \n\nThe smell afterwards, one of my favorites in the world. The sounds of the birds after it finished as well as the tires on the road put front. Slosh and chirps, glistening objects, different looking clouds from the usual winter variety. They are moving north now but what's left is quite the show of gray and white and blue. Unusual February drizzle, simply love rain. If only the best sound in the world of thunder showed up today, but no complaints besides that. \n\nNever in my life have I been this torn in thought and tossed all over, the existence of God, and for this amount of time either, how long the struggle has been going on for which is months now. You'd figure it's a simple decision - God is real or God is not real. Hasn't been, for whatever reason. Maybe it's because I kinda have to see God in today's weather and not revert back to the miracle and wonders of mother nature. Maybe something like that, just something so basic and primal about rain but oh so satisfying, but very special. Powerful but also...I dunno peaceful. Depending upon the storm that is. \n\nI guess it has kinda been like storms, inside my mind, struggling with the notion of God. Bad storms. Painful and just struggling. Really not sure why but some people may say it's trials or spiritual attacks. Or it's just me not knowing what to believe and still wanting to give mother nature the credit for today's weather. \n\nNot sure where this is headed, with God. Want to walk away and just give up on his existence but it comes creeping back. Not sure why that is. Any other struggle or painful thing in life is pretty easy to just set aside, move on this is adding zero value to my life. But he's still there. Nagging.

When this faculty is renewed by the Holy Spirit, the whole mind-set changes from the fearful negativism of the carnal mind to the vibrant, positive thinking of the quickened spiritual mind. \n\nJust something I flipped to in my study Bible, couple flips, after writing out everything above. There's certainly aspects of my mind which are broken, ones that God perhaps cannot and will not fix, but then again it does not seem as if much is off. Thinking things through...well yea I'm entirely sure. And I'm not sure that I'll ever be able to love God for the rain and not see mother nature as bringing it down. Nor love him with all my heart.

As I am halfway through Numbers, I have a lot of questions, and ones that Christians like to give me platitudes for answers. Most of these inquiries are leading me to wonder if the God I know is not the God of the Bible. It\u2019s not just the God I know, it\u2019s the God that everyone uses out of context (e.g., the Bible Promise books of \u201cfeel good\u201d Scriptures, putting Scriptures on everything to be inspirational but wholly taking them out of context), the God that everyone thinks they pray to, etc. I\u2019m even reluctant with my newfound knowledge to ask this for fear that I\u2019ll be struck down in some way.

To top It off, why did he need INNOCENT blood? A few examples of this are killing families and innocent animals (the entire Torah is full of this) for sins that they were unaware of. If someone snatched Genesis or Virgil because our neighbor sinned and we were linked to living in the same building, I\u2019d have no respect for whoever demanded that sacrifice.  \n\n\n2.\u00a0**Why did God create sin where there didn\u2019t need to be?**\u00a0In the story of the 10 plagues, God was the one who hardened Pharoah\u2019s heart. (**Exodus 10:1-2:**\n\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \u201cGo to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may perform these signs of Mine among them, and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your grandson, how I made a mockery of the Egyptians and how I performed My signs among them, that you may know that I am the LORD.\u201d) Why did GOD Harden his heart? Did he want an excuse to kill all the firstborn Egyptian children or something? The \u201cChristianese\u201d answer is something akin to, \u201cTo teach them how holy he was, and how serious he was, of course!\u201d But why did Pharaoh have to be used as a pawn? Are some people just predestined to be evil, made into \u201cpawns\u201d at the hand of an angry God that SOMEHOW wishes for everyone to be righteous? There\u2019s a song by Griffin House called \u201cJudas\u201d that\u2019s always been close to me and has always had this question burning at the back of my mind for about a decade.

Why are we NOT bound by the old Law?**\u00a0Jesus said in Matthew 5:17, \u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\u201d So, if the law was not abolished (this is why we still abide by the rules on sexual sin in Leviticus in our practicing of the faith), why are some things ok and not others? Why AREN\u2019T we making animal sacrifices, but we\u2019re still not sleeping with our cousins, mothers, fathers, sisters, etc? Why ARE we allowed to eat bacon, have period sex, and wearing mixed fabrics, but we still AREN\u2019T allowed to sacrifice children to Moloch? All of them are in the same law. The Christianese answer is that \u201cWe\u2019re not bound by the Old Law because that\u2019s what Jesus came to give us grace for!\u201d So, if these things are still pleasing to God, why aren\u2019t we doing them? Does that make us lackadaisical Christians if we\u2019re not making guilt, grain, sin and fellowship offerings, celebrating the Passover, etc?  \n\n\n**4.

Borderlines project - whatever insults they hurl at you are simply reflections of the things they dislike about themselves (e.g, selfish, lazy, etc.) This effect is called \u201cDARVO\u201d (Deflect, Attack, Reverse Victimize, Offended)  \nD. Borderlines have a way of making you hang onto their every word of praise, using that to define your self-esteem after you\u2019ve been split on. This makes you compulsively live up to their expectations. This is called \u201cFOG\u201d (Fear, Obligation, Guilt).  \nI am working with my therapist on my relationship with God. Comparing God to a parent makes me sick. My therapist and I have literally created a mantra to repeat to myself, \u201cGod is NOT Cosmic BPD\u201d. But in reading the Bible, I\u2019m starting to believe what I\u2019ve believed for the past 2 decades once more. Afraid to mess up. Notice that the Scriptures you find in calendars, devotionals, inspirational posters and the like are the\u00a0*pleasant*\u00a0words of God\u00a0*before*\u00a0he splits on his people. Or, they\u2019re records of other people doing so (e.g, the Psalms are simply David TALKING about how good God is, Paul is simply TALKING about how good God is, Jesus himself is even INTERCEDING for us to his angry father) Again, the \u201cChristianese\u201d answer is because \u201cGod is holy and we don\u2019t question it, because our thoughts are man-made\u201d. If God is more loving than any parent we\u2019ve ever known, even I can understand that my upbringing has bred trauma and is marred by an abject past, present and future of futile atonement. Is that what my eternity will be like, as well? Does this make me less holy because I have compassion? At this point, I don\u2019t care to listen to anyone who tells me that God isn\u2019t an iron judge, waiting with a proverbial lightning bolt to destroy me. Perhaps Valley View had their pedagogical procedure correct in penalizing even the SLIGHTEST iniquities with spiritual shame, sacrifice and unjust (according to sinful humans, of course) punishment. I am always afraid to sin for fear that a being that knows me enough to know my weaknesses has the cosmic power to smite me. I am constantly believing that exposure to my phobias, unfortunate events, pestilence, and ailments of my family is direct result of my sin, and I must atone for it. Which brings me to my next question:  \n\n\n**5. Why did God change if he is immutable by sending Jesus?**\u00a0The \u201cChristianese\u201d answer is something akin to \u201cBecause he loved us and wanted us to reside in heaven with him\u201d. Given that this is fact, why did countless nations, children and animals have to die prior if God knew he was going to do this to begin with? If Jesus \u201cintercedes\u201d for us, is Jesus essentially acting as the older sibling that takes the blame for whatever mess the younger has made to an angry parent?  \n\n\nIf you have nothing else to say other than \u201cI will simply pray for your trauma\u201d, I will accept that as a platitude, but I will admit that I don\u2019t feel comforted by it. Perhaps my \u201ctrauma\u201d from my Baptist school (that my father endorsed and still would support if given the chance) and my BPD parent has simply equipped me for an eternal penitentiary. I have never felt \u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201cjoy\u201d as a Christian as having this responsibility seems like a cross to bear, forever. That said, I will not abandon my faith. The God I know doesn\u2019t match the God of the Bible. The God I know might be something akin to an imaginary friend created out of fear. The God we ALL know may have been crafted this way in our own minds,\u00a0similar to the delusions that a trauma patient may have. These questions are uncomfortable due to our normalcy bias and our upbringings in the church that shun away and hush all the thoughts they may garner. I am unsure. If anyone has insight, I am all ears, because I want to understand and I don\u2019t want to feel like I've just gorged myself on fruit from the Tree of Knowledge and am having explosive, spiritual diarrhea.", "Does God hear the prayer of unbelievers?I don't have a religion, but I have been doing some research on religion, which includes Christianity.

My parents were pretty good about it though, not letting me play anything violent until I was mature enough, which I understand. My parents didn\u2019t care if I read Harry Potter or Percy Jackson, they were just stories. \n\nMy parents were never church going people. My mother went through a divorce and had an abortion before I was born, so she never felt welcome in a church. Always feared the judgment of others and by God.

What game would you choseI would probably play uno against them.", "The Gospels were not anonymous[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZbgW\\_0ELnk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZbgW_0ELnk)  \nThis video is fairly long (45 mins) because it goes over each of the relevant manuscripts and quotes from ancient sources.\n\nTLDR; \n\nEvery manuscript of the New testament that we have (with the relevant page surviving) is titled with the specific gospel author named. Not a single manuscript that we have is anonymous. Each Greek, Latin or Coptic (And Syriac according to one article I was using) manuscript from the earliest we have (2nd century) says something akin to \"Euaggelion Kata (Author)\" - \"The Gospel according to (Author). Not one manuscript indicates any of them were anonymous, and not one of them disagrees with the traditional attribution of the Gospels.\n\nAncient sources are unanimous in attributing the four gospels to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Papias is the first to make a claim, he wrote some time from 90-110 AD, but was also someone who was alive during the lifetime of the apostles. He attributes Mark and Matthew's Gospels. Irenaeus (180AD), who was a student of Polycarp, a student of the apostle John attributes all four gospels to the respective authors. \n\nThere are many other ancient sources listed, from different times and across vastly different geographical areas and each of them all unanimously agree the gospels were written by the four authors.   \n\n\nThe letter to the Hebrews is one we can say for sure was anonymous because 1) The manuscripts do not mention authorship and 2) there is disagreement amongst ancient writers on who wrote it. Different traditions emerged, with some saying Paul wrote it, others Clement, Barnabas etc. Origen simply shrugs and says \"only God knows\". It is extremely implausible, that anonymous gospels, being given a false attribution much later on could have gotten universal attribution across different geographical areas, as if a copyist in Egypt decided to attach Matthew's name to a Gospel, a counterpart in Rome would have no way of knowing and no reason to trust when he was used to only seeing anonymous texts.  \n\n\nThis anonymous gospel claim is unsupported by any evidence. Writings like 1 Clement (70ad) support this, reporting of the specific apostles who preached the Gospel to Rome - Peter and Paul having been recently martyred, to which many in the Roman church that originated this letter would have been living witnesses to. 1 Clement shows that the teachings of Jesus including his resurrection were not part of a \"Telephone Game\", as it was the specific eye-witnesses who spread the message.  \n\n\nThe theory also doesn't make sense. If someone was going to attribute anonymous gospels to followers of Jesus to give them legitimacy, why on earth would they choose Mark or Luke? Neither were eye-witnesses. Mark was a follower of Peter and Luke of Paul. Why choose Matthew? if not for his Gospel he would be one of the least noteworthy apostles. The only other thing we learn about him from the new testament was that he was a tax collector. We see with the later gnostic gospels that those who chose to invent a connection tended to choose figures that had far more presence in the gospel narrative. Falsely attributing the Gospels to Matthew, and especially Mark and luke does not make sense. Besides, as soon as more than one gospel was circulating it would have been necessary for them to have titles in order to distinguish them.  \n\n\nI do not mean to offend anyone who holds this view, but the anonymous gospel theory doesn't have any real evidence. No anonymous manuscripts exist, and not one ancient writer, even pagans like Celsus, gives even a slight indication that a \"telephone game\" happened. Not one writer of the first few centuries proposes alternate authors for any of the four or indicates that they were originally anonymous.", "Is playing pokemon really a sin? (my research on it) + something about intrusive thoughtsI know this may be a silly question, but I wanted to be sure.\n\nI always loved playing pokemon (I don't put it before God), playing the games, watching the anime, having some plushies, drawing fakemons, etc...But not so long ago I remembered that people some time ago thought pokemon was anti-christian and I got scared I was comitting a sin by playing itI looked at old posts on this sub to know if it was ok, and most people say it was. Even on truechristians, a sub I'm pretty reluctant of beacuse most people there tend to be very strict from what I had seen before, people were saying it was ok.But I still doubted so I looked a bit more into it...( if you don't want to read all of this, please could you just read what's after the line?)\n\nFirst there was an article about the creator of pokemon giving an interview in which he said pokemon was \"anti-christian\", article which turned out to be fake\n\nthen there is the thing about pokemons \"evolving\", which was a problem back then, but now many if not most christians (including me) think christianity and evolution can go hand in hand, combined with the fact pokemon do more of a metamorphosis than a real evolution there seems to be no problem with that\n\nafter that there is people saying it's not ok because some pokemons are evil, but they mostly come of occidental religions and not christianity, I also dont see the problem with calling something who's evil \"evil\", I thought that was the whole point. Also most of the dark type pokemons who are violent is just behavior you can see in wild animals\n\nNext up we have pokemon using magic, here also it doesn't seem to be anti-christian magic, it's also just a fantasy world\n\nSome pokemons like Kadabra were seen as having occult symbols, but I saw a video were that mostly got debunked as being, once again, inspired by occidental religions (in the comments of that video there was a guy saying, pokemon was evil with video and film links that didn't work, and due to a YouTube glitch that sometimes happened some of the comments of that guy disappeared for me, even without seeing his arguments made me doubt again)\n\nThe thing is, pokemon actually has some things going for it:\n\ncharacters in the anime like Misty using a cross for example (I think it was a change of the american version tho but still)\n\nThe pope giving its approvalBut, about this one, I saw some people calling the pope evil and a messenger from the devil, so even though it's not my belief, it still makes me doubt because I think \"what if?\"\n\nSo, with all that mostly going in pokemons favor, this question already having been posted and the answers of it being mostly positive, why do I still make this post?Because I'm an anxious person and I want confirmation, I also want my post to help other people with the same question find their answers\n\nSome may say \"if you feel uncanny about it, it may be a message from God, so just don't do it\", but as an anxious person if I didn't do anything I had slight doubts about, I would do close to nothing, yes I want to follow Christ and yes I could use all that time for Bible study, but is that really what we as christians need to do?

So back in the days it was a pretty rare thing. But with the newer version it's way easier to find them. And you can also use shiny hnting methods to really boost your odds. And sometimes, like many other pokemon players I'll go shiny hunting, while shiny hunting I sometimes have intrusive thoughts because it doesn't require much thinking, and when not thinking about much my intrusive thoughts frequently pop up. The thing is my intrusive thoughts are sometimes anti-christian, I'll have thoughts about selling my soul (what I totally don't want to do, and even if many people say your sould can't be sold because it belongs to God, some say otherwise which once again, makes me doubt because I don't know who to believe). I instantly try to repel these thoughts with thoughts about Jesus and God, but even then if I get lucky and get the pokemon I'm doing efforts for, by searching for I'll still be scared that I accidentaly sold my soul with this dumb thoughts and that it is the reason I got lucky. So I feel like I just waste my luck by sometimes just deleting the pokemon I put time in for.\n\nI feel like this may be it, when looking at pokemon related YouTube videos, I won't be scared I'm sinning, I'm also not scaared of my pokemon plushies, but I think I'm just scared of getting lucky in the game as dumb as it may sound\n\nThanks if you read all that or even just a part of it or even just said your thoughts by just reading the title. I really like (almost) everything pokemon related (except maybe the card game), playing the games, watchin pokemon content, drawing fakemons which I like doing because it tests my creativity. If it was a sin I'm willing to stop playing it. Maybe I'll just test playing it less to see if that helps.But I also don't want to abandon one of my biggest hobbies because I'm anxious for no good reason.So please leave your thoughts on this in the comments.\n\nAnyway, I wish you a good day  \n\n\nEdit: also forgot to share, I asked God for answers opened my Bible on a random page to read a random verse (heard about some people doing that when they want answers), it didn't give me any responses, I went to another page which had a verse about a tree and his fruits (I don't remember the verse it was), and I thought that maybe it could mean that if something doesn't lead me to doing evil, then it isn't evil (I don't know the context of that verse and its real meaning tho, but I found it interesting to stumble upon)", "I'd love your help making a Game!Good Day To Everyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConcept:\n\nMy name is Elijah, I am twenty-one and in third year of Uni studying for a Theology Degree with my BA paper on the OT.

To combine a game like \"Life is Strange\" and Assassins Creed concepts/graphics into a game. In this game, you are a troubled young-adult going to a university that has been rumored to have high pass rates from the bible actually coming to life. You will be controlling the young-adult, and also key figures within the story of moses, jumping from modern times to ancient times. While in the modern time, you will be the young-adult in first person perspective, able to explore an \"open\" college campus that is closed off to the public. You however have a fictional task, uncovering who is attempting to corrupt and destroy the university from the inside out, however because this is your first year at the university, you may not get far if you do not spend time on this side. Meanwhile, when you are in class, you will be studying the story of Moses, living out his life in many key parts, and exploring the lands of his time from a third person perspective being as accurate as possible with the main story line, and having side objectives or things that could have happened, Such as for example meeting someone who is in need of water from the river, animals hunting you, and things of that nature to have the world come to life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Background: \n\nGiven this fragment, I will give a little about myself.

To be more specific my specialty is World Design, I have a passion for it, and have honestly done it for ten years with this concept of a game on my mind/heart, but had never taken it seriously up until recent years due to whether it be technical limitations or lack of knowledge. I have worked with many small local inde companies so small it isn't worth mentioning, and have ran communities within the tens of thousands. In addition, I have had a Christian Community on discord that has been running since 2017.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I Need Help With:\n\nyou may be asking yourself now what I need help with exactly, and that is forming a solid team to turn this concept of a game into something that glorifies Christ. I am not here to advertise my game, however please note that in order to form a team, you have to talk about it... which is why I am here, and at other places, asking for help with any of the following \\~Below with a brief description\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\~Discord Community Manager - Able to manage the discord, keeping up with and managing the moderators and discord. \n\n\\~Discord Community Moderaters - Able to watch the discord and keep things clean, while generating conversation. \n\n\\~Level Designers - This will be unreal engine 5 in 3D, requesting experience in both landscapes and architecture designing.\n\n\\~Modern Story Designers - This will consist of the story outside of the story of moses, Common Dialogue amongst NPCs, Diaries, etc...\n\n\\~Ancient Story Designers - Guided by multiple PHD/Masters in Theology and pastors with over six years of experience studying OT.\n\n\\~Core-related Implementer - Able to combine multiple blueprints and help pull everyones work together into one major project.\n\n\\~Character Design - Blender may be an essential here, however it is also possible to get away with using another program.\n\n\\~Social Media Manager - Tweet here and there, as well as interact with multiple communities!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would like to specify that because this is a serious project, the minimal age requirement is eighteen unless under special circumstances.

Mom was alcoholic she barely pay bills I grew up, basically have no food no heat had to warm up water in the microwave to take a bath in have to watch. My mom get beat had to wash my digging under the influence. My dad brought in peoples so those people can have sex in my sisters rooms. And he get paid for it.  My mom would finally buy me a game system one time and my dad sells it for drugs. Didn\u2019t have a table. Had to eat on the floor on newspapers had a roach infested. I could see my grandpa and demons would torment me all my childhood because I could see them they would give me a nightmares so bad every night I would wake up throwing up ,family used to tell us don\u2019t tell the school anybody but what\u2019s going on in the house this because they would\u2019ve took us. I grew up very poor had the same clothes to wear to school then get a new pair of shoes to the new school year.\nMy dad took advantage of me by me doing he\u2019s work and he only giving me $5 for 12hours of work. At a young age . Didn\u2019t have transportation my mom was depending on what everybody else.\nSo struggling through my child hood \nWhen I became a teenager \nMy dad got worse on drugs best my mom more infront of my sisters he didn\u2019t care. \nMom would drink till she black out and run around the neighborhood naked. I couldn\u2019t focus on school because of that shit. Then they had the nerves to put me into special education. Where was god then ? \nI always had faith in god but I definitely lost him at that time \nMy cousin got shot in my driveway! \nMy other cousins had breast cancer and died \nMy grandpa died when I was 4 \nMy family spilt up . Two of my youngest sister move with my family member \nMy other sister move in with my other family member \nAnd I grew up with another family member.  \nI took a test in 7 grade so I could pass out special education and I did pass .  I didn\u2019t belong there, but when I move in with my auntie. I somehow get back into special education. This time they will never give me a test, so I dropped out of high school. They had me messed up. I got robbed out of my education I got wrapped everything I was receiving a Social Security check I wasn\u2019t getting it how many wasn\u2019t being spent on me he never got spent on me selfish desires I really can spit on her kids before me. I never head nothing in my life. I\u2019m antisocial I\u2019m always alone I\u2019m lonely. I have a lot of anger that was built up. I don\u2019t learn to let all the anger go. So I try to escape . I tried dating girls all they did was I wanna manipulate me trying to play me like I\u2019m a fool I used to call me retarded in school. I was just a class clown. I try to be strong every day I ask for god help. I never received it , it\u2019s funny because I was had a loving heart. I really had people smile because I was miserable. I rather see people happy because I was miserable because I was a fa failure I wasn\u2019t shit people used to take a vantage of me because of my heart is pure good and I will forgive them and they would do it again, and I will forgive them again like over and over because I can never hold hatred in my heart, but it sucks.  I got shot by own family member. I\u2019ll see how much I\u2019m really loved in my own family. I couldnt even see my mom side of family. Because my grandpa was racist my mom says so I\u2019ve been despised by both my family. I\u2019ve been hated by my own family. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not good on this earth. Now I\u2019m a young man trying to give he\u2019s life to god and I pray, but I still receive no answers. I believe I have faith I waited. I was patient never get no answers. I asked for the Holy Spirit. He never gave it to me ask for guidance he never give it to me extra strength, he never give it to me, I never ask any selfish prayer just prayer to help me get closer to him. He still don\u2019t give it to me. I don\u2019t care about a blessing. All I care about being with him God but it\u2019s like God really hates me. He put me through hell and still put me to hell I don\u2019t have friends I don\u2019t have people to talk to. I am lonely I am bored. I don\u2019t know what to do. I am confused and lost, just s wonder that nobody loves is like God put me on reserve just so I could be in Hell do you know how it feels to look at your own mom with bruises all over her broken bones and people still talking down on her. Why did god choose me to be alive in his life why am I\u2019m here? What is my purpose? Because I believe my purpose is just being here for the rest of my life and eternal life, and all I wanna do is be with the father I\u2019m abandon man nobody loves me after I get back to us and nothing change then I\u2019m going to submit myself into a mental hospital or I\u2019ma just kill myself because of why I\u2019m in this damn life and shit to live for. Because I\u2019ve done countless of prayers done countless a reading God\u2019s word , cause I done stepped away from smoking nicotine. I stepped away from smoking weed. I\u2019m trying to do a whole 360 on my whole life. What was the point if I\u2019m all I\u2019m axing God this whole time please can I have guidance and you never answer me I can\u2019t do this shit alone stop possible for me to long as I keep failing Jesus heal the blind man let them see again I believe Jesus, all my heart with my faith. I asked him to heal my eyes I never even got my eyes healed I still wake up needing glasses.  It\u2019s funny how the devil wants me more than God devil always been calling me. I told him my faith is with god. But it feels like a one way street", "I believe that Jesus has saved my life, since I have accepted him into my lifeFor context, I have been sort of an atheist/agnostic for most of my life, my mom believes in God/Jesus, prays and has read the bible and my dad is a complete atheist and both allowed me to develop my own faith, and when I was 15/16 I became a \u201csuper\u201d atheist and openly criticised and mocked all religions (this was also probably one of the most unhappiest periods of my life), and I was also a terrible person during this time, I stole, bullied, was racist and sexist, compulsively lied, hurt people, was very selfish and I would always feel bad and apologised but never changed and hated myself. \n\nA few months ago I was at a very low point and greatly considered religion but was scared to commit, and a few days later I went into one of my lessons and had a substitute teacher who was a part time pastor at a church on the other side of my city, he was a very kind and thoughtful person and we spoke and he told me that Jesus always loves and forgives, I never saw this substitute teacher ever again at my school and I figured that there\u2019s no way it was a coincidence that I consider becoming Christian and the next day I meet him, I knew it was a sign from god. After that I prayed to god and apologised for my actions and begged for forgiveness. \n\nSince then I have been praying as much as possible and trying my hardest to be a good person, help people and refrain from sin and I\u2019ve been much happier and finally don\u2019t feel guilt just the love of Christ, I\u2019m still yet to go church for the first time but I plan on very soon I\u2019m just quite anxious to.\n\nOne thing I was scared about with becoming Christian was that I thought I\u2019d have to give up many of the things I enjoyed, such as movies, tv shows, video games, comic books and music but this subreddit has taught me that those things are fine as long as they don\u2019t affect your relationship with god.", "When Jesus listens to and considers prayers during a football game, does he consider the team\u2019s win-loss record and score?", "Is Gaming , Pokemon , Harry Potter - Anti Christ?", "what is your view on assassin's creed valhalla?Is there any good Christian values to be found in here?

Just as a game.\n\nThe player starts off lost and dead, surrounded by darkness and creatures of darkness. He has a limited amount of time to find the light. Every now and then he has glimpses of the light, be it bible verses, people who talk about Jesus or something. The player has to follow the right people or the right hints and clues to find the ultimate light and once he has found the light its the Gospel, the cross of Jesus Christ. There he has the choice to accept it or reject it. Once he rejects it, his time is shortened, his vision gets darker than before, more evil surrounds him and he has to find the light again but with less time and more hardship, either until his time is over and he dies or until he finds it and accepts it. \n\nOnce he has accepted it, he gets the armor of God. His life is now eternal, the screen lights up and he sees more light. Demons try to attack, but he defends himself with the word of God, bible verses pop up against the lies. A demon attacks him for example with: \"God has abandoned you!\" He has a few seconds to attack back with a bible quote like \"Never will I leave you or forsake you!\" If he fails, the screen gets a little darker, his vision a little blurrier. He has to recharge with prayer or bible verses.\n\nHis mission is to be the light for other people. It can be a multiplayer game, other lost players can get glimpses of light through him to find the cross or it's just a normal game where he just rescues souls.\n\nAlso, note: Before the game starts the person has to insert whether or not he is a Christian. If he's not a Christian then he can play this game as long as he wants, in hopes he gets saved.

I also have some digimon blind bag figures. I'm just worried because like... is it idolatry? I won't hesitate to take everything down if it is. I have posters too of bands, comic books... I just think of it as decoration. but would it be considered idolatry? my main concern is the figurines because they are well... statues. \n\nAlso, is it considered sinful to have your videogame character worship another God? for example, in Skyrim and Genshin impact, there is no Jesus. I understand however that these games are fiction. What WORRIES me is that in genshin, theres a button to make your character bow down to a statue, and in Skyrim you're able to recieve a blessing from \"talos\".... would this also be considered idol worship? its not me, its the videogame character... but i feel weird inside when my characters come across these statues that bless your character, or when a game mentions a \"god\" that is not Christ... the worst is when a game mentions multiple gods. \n\nbascially, im asking because i feel guilty, but i do not know if, logically, it is idolatry or not. I'm trying to decide whether i should take down my figurines or not, stop playing these games or not, or continue playing and just avoid all the \"blessing\" things... and do posters count? \n\nIs all of this sinful, or am i overthinking it?

What genre would it be?", "Video game collecting as a Christian\"And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.\" Colossians 3:17. \n  \nAs a follower of Jesus, I want to honor Him and include Him in everything I do. So for me, that includes collecting video games!  \n  \nI've been a gamer since I was 3 years old. I remember the first video game I ever played: Pacman for the Atari 2600. Outrunning the ghost and trying to get those pellets. I was hooked. 2 years after that, I got my first system in 1990... The Nintendo Entertainment System. All it took was a plumber and that catchy music. To this day, I get excited like a little boy whenever a new Mario game comes out.  \n  \nSo what does video game collecting look like as a Christian?  \n\nFor me, it's looked like a lot of things. For starters, I love the idea of including God in everything I do. If God loves me so much He would send His son to die for me, then I believe God is very personal and even cares about my hobbies. This revelation has allowed me to grow even closer to God. Obviously with any hobby, there has to be self-control and grace. I'm not perfect. But by allowing God to enter this hobby with me, my life has become even fuller in Christ.  \n  \nAny collector will tell you that a big part of collecting is nostalgia. Which is a way of connecting with the inner child inside all of us. Turns out, that's actually very healing. In Psalm 42, David speaks to his soul. The soul is made up of the mind, will, and emotions. I believe the soul is just another term for the inner child. The deepest part of ourselves. Dr. Henry Cloud in his book \"Changes That Heal\" speaks about how trauma can cause our inner child to be stuck in time. And picking up where that child left off can lead to a lot of inner healing. Within the past few months, I finally beat Mega Man X and Super Metroid for the SNES. Games I always wanted to play but was intimidated by as a kid. It may sound weird, but beating those games actually helped me to heal from wounds of shame. And to realize I am not defined by my performance, my value comes from Jesus.  \n  \nIt's lead to opportunities of giving. About 6 years ago, I felt a strong pull from the Holy Spirit about giving out of my abundance. So I decided to give away my entire Xbox 360 collection on Facebook Marketplace. People were confused as to why I would do such a thing. I said, \"It's because Jesus wants you to know that He loves you.\" The result? People were blown away and overwhelmed with joy. The seeds were planted.  \n  \nIt's also lead to opportunities of sharing my testimony and witnessing with others. I've been to many comic, video game, and anime conventions in my day. And I love to share my testimony and how God has saved my life. The drug addictions, the hurt and pain, and ultimately the redemption. It's also fun to pass out these business cards that my buddy had printed for us. Blue and Red cards that just say, \"Jesus loves nerds\" on them. No advertising of churches or any agenda. Just a simple message of love that God loves you, even in your hardcore hobbies. As a gamer, otaku, geek, or nerd... You are loved. God bless.", "New historically accurate video game about the Gospel needs YOUR support on kickstarter!There is a new awesome bible video game called \"One of 500\" on kickstarter right now, that would need our support to reach its goals.

I love controlling people\u2019s lives, creating characters, and making some storylines that tells an interesting narrative. Those are the things that God can only do. There are many indications from scripture that explains that it is a sin to pretend to be a god or *be* a god.\n\nAccording to Isaiah 42:8\n\n> I am the Lord; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to carved idols.\n\n 1 Corinthians 8:6- \n\n> yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.\n\nSo as mentioned before, the main purpose of The Sims is to be your own god and control other people. As followers of Christ, it is indeed a sin to pretend that we are god or seeing ourselves as one. What do you guys think about \u201cplaying god\u201d on The Sims.\n", "From Mines to Mountains \u2013 How the World's Best-Selling Video Game Mirrors Christian Cosmology", "Bible Games 2 - Angry Video Game Nerd", "Bible Games 3 - Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN)", "Bible Video Game Translation...sin?If I were to translate the Bible into video game terminology, would it be wrong to translate \"God\" to the video games closest version of God?\n\nFor example, if the god figure in this video game was called, Tyranus, would it be wrong to say, \"For Tyranus so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son...\"?", "What do you guys think of the video game: The Binding of Isaac?If you're not familiar with the game TBoI, I'll try to explain it, but it's so hard to describe. It's a game I've been very interested in since I got it a few months ago, because it reminds me of growing up and trying to figure out myself while fighting through the influences of fundamentalism, hating myself and thinking everything was sinful.\n\nThe game is, on the surface, a modern retelling of the story of Isaac. Isaac is a young boy, around 5 to 10, and his mom hears the voice of God telling her to kill him. Isaac escapes into his basement, which is absolutely filled with monsters, feces, urine, gore and especially blood. He travels deeper underground killing monsters by crying on them, until he faces his mother in combat.\n\nIt's obvious that the game's events aren't literal. Isaac is a very creative kid, and everything from his mother trying to kill him is a story in his mind. Hints are in the game that Isaac's reality is filled with enough troubles that his horrifying fantasy is preferable. His mother is likely physically and emotionally abusive, as well as neglectful. His father left, his cats all died, and he may have once had a brother and a sister. On top of that, the way he's interpreting the Bible's words and his mom's actions leads him to believe he's irredeemably sinful / evil. Most fans of the game believe Isaac is attempting (and maybe succeeding at) suicide.\n\nThat's the shortest description I can give of the meaningful things behind the game, for those unfamiliar with it. The workings of Isaac's mind make me feel and think more than any game has, even though most of the time you're playing, you're just killing monsters without thinking about the story. Interested in hearing anyone's thoughts here. I'm sorry if this is too long... I think this community will have more interesting things to say about this than a gamer community.\n\n\n(A small note, and another personal connection I feel to the character: He seems to not be completely cis-male, trying to figure out his identity.

Fire Emblem is weirder.\"\n\nCurrently, I am playing through Fire Emblem: The Sword of Seals (sometimes called \"the Binding Blade\"), and I stumbled across a bit of character dialogue that made me double-take when I read it. It was between two characters named Saul (a priest of a monotheistic church) and Igrene (a normal soldier). Characters can speak to one another several times, and the first two times between these two are about how Igrene says that she does not believe in God after Saul mentions that he is a priest (and tries to convert her). However, at the end of the second conversation, this bit of conversation appears:\n\n\"Igrene: Those who pray to God expect something in return. But they will never receive anything, and that causes them to hate God. I think that it would be a lot less trouble to think that no such being exists in the first place.\n\nSaul: ...... Yes, you are right.\n\nIgrene: ...Is it all right for a priest like you to be saying that?\n\nSaul: It is all right, I am an open-minded person. However, Saint Elimine did say this: 'God does not help us because He believes in us.'\n\nIgrene: Believes...in us?\n\nSaul: Yes.\"\n\nThen, later, their dialogue expands on what Father Saul was talking about.\n\n\"Igrene: Father Saul.\n\nSaul: Oh, Igrene! What is the matter? Ah, so you finally decided to give in to the urge to come see me...\n\nIgrene: It is about what you said the other day... You said that God does not help us because He believes in us.\n\nSaul: This is what Saint Elimine said... God, who created this world, is all-powerful. He can change people and the \nworld. He can alter us humans so that we would not be fighting like this. However, is that really the right way?\n\nIgrene: ......\n\nSaul: Humans that act according to God's will alone would only be mindless puppets. God believes that we humans can change, that we can learn from our mistakes. God knows that we can overcome our hardships to achieve peace and harmony.\n\nIgrene: ...... I don't believe in God, but I respect people who think as you do. Thank you for your time, Father Saul. I must be off now...\n\nSaul: Please, it is my pleasure to be able to help you.\"\n\nWhile hardly a theological masterpiece, it is interesting to see it mentioned in a video game, a Japanese-made one, at that.

The example I am thinking of is the Zelda series, where the latest games (Skyward Sword and Breath of the Wild) have a fictional religion of goddess Hylia in them. It's not shown to be fake (you know, like people say of the Hindu religion, they say it's all fiction and none of the prayers actually work) because Hylia intercedes several times in both the story and gameplay and is portrayed as a heroic character. So I have a few questions here because I don't understand people who are in defense of that stuff being in the game. I'm not singling out Zelda. I'm talking of all types of religious stuff like this and using it as a popular example. Thank you.\n\n1. Some people say that the \"idolatry\" that their character does in the game does not count for real life sins, because they are performing it in a fictional context. But isn't God watching what you play in the real world? Why does it not count as enjoying idolatry if you are enjoying the game where you do that?\n2. Why is it that in fiction, they empathize with a non-Christian religion, but in real life, if these people met a \"real life Hylian\" they would be all like \"Oh no! Did you know that God can send you to hell for that?!?\"\n3. Relatedly, some people say it is just fiction. But what says in the Bible that we are allowed to imagine such a world without the Christian God? Or that we are allowed to enjoy when others tell stories without God in the world? Jesus didn't tell stories without His existence in there!\n4. Some say \"I just play the game for fun. God surely couldn't be mad about fun\", but then they call other \"fun\" things like porn and gay sex as sins. How can it be \"just gaming\" if they won't take the excuse of \"just hormones\" or \"I needed to get it out\"?\n5. Doesn't these games go against the idea that all things should be made for God's glory if they do not glorify God?\n6. Some people say it is like Aslan, that the fictional goddess reminds them of things about the real God. But C. S. Lewis meant for those parallels to the Christian God to be there. Nintendo didn't.

So I thought I'd like to bring it into a Christian context and talk.\n\nBasically, the article says that *Westworld,* with its depiction of an amusement park full of robotic citizens that guests are free to interact with as they choose (which usually results in torture, sex, and murder), has a lot of resonance with video games like GTA V, where you basically do the same thing.\n\nNow, they come to the conclusion that it's not quite the same, because NPC's in the game are not sentient, as the robots in Westworld are becoming.  But as a Christian, I'm not sure that's an actual difference.  Whether the robots are more realistic or not, they still would not have souls.  I don't believe there would be an \"Awareness\", or if there would be, it would just be another level of imitation, not actual sentience as such.  I think, I **think** this is something I can safely count on most Christians agreeing on.\n\nWhat then?  Westworld certainly makes such behavior seem evil, but is that just because of the robot's resemblance to humans?  After all, in this view, no one is actually getting hurt--even the Robots are rebooted the next day with no memories.  So is killing/torturing them really sin?\n\nMy own thought is yes, it is, though not because of what it does to the robots.  Rather, because of what it does to the person.

And it came to me through my playing of the game Red Dead Redemption 2. It will take awhile to summarize so prepare yourself for a longish read. If you have not played this game I must warn you of spoilers. If you don't care or have played it then read on.\n\nTo sum up the game, it is a prequel to the original. The first being about a man trying to save his family held hostage by the government to blackmail him to kill his former outlaw gang members. It was the story of his redemption. The second game was about that same outlaw gang and their debt collector, Arthur Morgan. Arthur is what you call a rough and tough cowboy. The game is set in 1899 and about Arthur's journey in redemption. Him and his gang have killed and robbed a lot of people. Mostly people who \"deserve\" it is a robin hood-esque mantra but they did \"help a lot of folk too\". Arthur in the game goes to collect a debt from a family man and beats him in his face a bit. The man coughs blood into Arthur's face which leads to him contracting tuberculosis. Back then it was mostly a death sentence. Although the game allows you to choose to be bad or good, the honorable route usually is the intended route. Arthur starts to realize after a string a bad luck and some death of his friends that things are not as they should be. He starts to reflect on his life. He starts giving to the poor and broken. He cancels some debts in the end and even gives them money instead. He helps out the widow of the man he beat to get her out of dark life she's spiraled into. He has several conversations with a nun who teaches him about goodness. He tries to correct the course of the gangs leader who starts killing innocents, going after revenge, and seems to be losing his mind. Now Arthur can easily run away and meet up with the girl he loves but he can't do that. There are people much better than he is in the gang who need protecting. And ultimately the gang seals its fate when confronting the United States Army. Arthur confronts the man who corrupted his gang but unfortunately most of the gang (those who decided to stay and not leave) stick with this man. Arthur manages to get the women and children away as well as a close friend of his who ends up the hero of the first game. Arthur sacrifices his life to let him get away and ultimately dies on the mountain top.\n\nNow how does this correlate to my vision? Well in the game if you choose the good route then Arthur has multiple visions of stags or bucks. Especially at important parts of his life. As I finished his tale I realized there are many things to take away. The first was Arthur always told people he was not a good man. **Romans 3:10** says *\"As it is written: \"There is no one righteous, not even one\".* Arthur recognizes his sins and how they have impacted the world. Our past sisns do not go away, there must a penalty for it. Perhaps it was his contraction of TB or perhaps it was his rough death on the mountaintop. Who knows. In a way we are all an Arthur Morgan. We have sinned against the world and a holy God. Done things that no amount of good things can right. **Romans 3:20** says *\"because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.\"* We have condemned ourselves to the fate we have. Unfortunately Arthur is a fictional character so salvation is not for him. Yet there comes a point in his life where he realized that although he is not good there is a revelation that there can be something else. After confessing his fear to the nun on her way to a mission trip Arthur resolves himself. He resolves himself with the time he has left as a changed man he can save those within his power to do so.\n\nI have to praise God that we as sinners have been changed into something new. **2 Corinthians 5:17** says *\"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!\"* We are no longer sinners but children of a Holy God. We have found our redemption in Him! By the power of His spirit we can reach the lost. **Ephesians 1:17**, *\"In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God\u2019s grace.\"* Although we were like Arthur now we can reach those also like Arthur. Like a buck which symbolizes regeneration and God's faithfulness to His children. We can bring people to the water that quells all thirst (**John 4:14)**. Although we live in a world with a tempter in the ear of those we love like Arthur, we can fight back. Jesus Christ is the great redeemer who raises the dead back to life. So let us take this opportunity to praise a God so good that He would save people like us who oh so do not deserve it. Let us love the lost and broken. Let repent of the trespasses when have done to others. For the blood of Christ is sufficient enough. It truly is a Red Dead Redemption, amen.\n\nI leave you with **Ephesians 2:1-9** i hopes you will be encouraged. God bless.\n\n*\"As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,* ***2*** *in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.* ***3*** *All of us also lived among them at one time,gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath.* ***4*** *But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,* ***5*** *made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions\u2014it is by grace you have been saved.* ***6*** *And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,* ***7*** *in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace,expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.* ***8*** *For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God\u2014* ***9*** *not by works, so that no one can boast.* ***10*** *For we are God\u2019s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. \"*", "Morality in a video game?Hello,\n\nThere are MMORPGS out where you play and can steal from opposing players.  In these MMORPGs, there are sites you can sell gold for real money.\n\nIt might sound fun to play as a pirate who steals from their opponents, but say you finally quit the game and sell your account, you're basically hocking stolen goods right?\n\nWe're classically trained to say anything digital has no value, and you can kill, steal, and bully opposing players saying you're playing the role of a bad guy or even enforcing justice.  However, since there are sites to sell goods, should we always play as the good guy?  After all, what kind of person are we if we steal from someone in game, then sell it on an online auction site for real money?  Is that any different than stealing from someone in real life?\n\nSo it makes me wonder, what kind of morality should we have in a video game.  \n\nThis is just meant as a fun topic, and not something I'm wrestling over.", "If you use a potion or serum or magic in a video game does it count as actual sorcery or witchery?", "Which videos games do you guys likeas a gamer myself im quite curious which kind of videos games you guys like and which ones you think are christian or non-christian my favourite are are League Of Legends and Runescape", "Life is like a video gameSo as im writing this you may think im a bit mad with my allegory but here I go.\n\nSee it sort of hits me that life is a bit like a game,a MMORPG to be precise.

As Christians we can some times get a bit focused on these goals ( the churches goals/life goals) and forget about the people in our lives\n\nSo im praying for myself personally that whenever life brings out a new expansion I don't groan and moan and focus on it, im praying that I remember that I have a church family and I have friends and I have God.\n\nNo matter what level 900 boss Im praying I don't allow it to overshadow my life. That I focus on the people I care for as well. Im praying that I allow my friends to help me with the bosses in my life.

I didn't even know I would be making this post until now.\n\n\\-Meditations-\n\nHe is not giving you the blessing because you aren't ready. Maybe he knows you're going to mess it up. He is preparing you for it. In that preparation, you will fall, bleed and cry, many, many times. In this preparation, you will have to prove to him & yourself that you are worth receiving it. That you are ready for it. Maybe Allah is trying to give you his mercy, but your soul is not open to receiving it. See that corner up ahead? That is where you will meet your first love. He is trying to give you that gift, but you're not ready for it. And he knows that. And in this knowledge, he withholds. But he withholds to give. And when he finally does give, you receive something much greater than what you wanted in the first place.\n\nWe as humans are weak. We gravitate to that which we can see, touch and hear. In doing so, we forget about a very special creation of Allah. In fact, it is our essence, what makes us special, the soul. In the process of polishing and caring for this very special gift, Allah will give you additional gifts along the way. I learned this through experience. I asked him to guide me through this process & I am still receiving new gifts every so often. Allah allowed me to unlock this secret of the universe: The mind learns through knowledge. The soul learns through experience. He taught my soul by allowing certain events to unfold in my life. We all already know this in theory, but to experience it is to truly learn it. There's some weird stuff going on here guys. I don't know how Allah's unseen system works and nor do I need to know (he has hidden that from us for a reason). But its real. It's very real. We all know it's real but to experience something of it is a different feeling that I can't explain. I can't put it into words. I can catch people's vibes now. I'll be talking to a girl that\u2019s a 10/10 but if I catch a bad vibe it instantly puts her at a 3/10 and I wouldn't touch her with a 10 foot pole.\n\nThe eyes are a window to the soul. The ears are a window into the soul.\n\nYour eyes and ears have been feasting on intellectual junk food. Your eyes and ears have been gorging on filth that kills your soul. Your soul might be clinging to life because your prayers lack substance, it is in no position to receive. Your prayers lack substance because of your conduct. It's all a vicious cycle.\n\nYour hands must be empty to receive. Your heart must be empty to receive. Empty yourself, only then will he give. Because that is when you are ready.\n\nIt all starts with you correcting your conduct. Porn is at the forefront of that conduct. Music contributes a lot. Every time you park incorrectly at jummah, that contributes. Break yourself free from false attachments. Give sadaqah, in doing so you are removing wealth from your heart. Rediscover the essence of Islam instead of just the mechanical actions that make up your worship. Break out of that day to day rut. Your soul will open up to EXPERIENCE. You will experience this life instead of just being a robotic player for shaitan. Allah taught this to many prophets through EXPERIENCE. Musa (as) was commanded to drop his staff and take off his shoes. There is a deeper, symbolic reality behind this if we just open our ~~eyes~~ hearts to it.\n\nWhen you act in accordance to what Allah wants, your soul will feel it. And as a result, you will transform. At the heart of Islam is this transformational process. At the core of all these political debates, we can change our ummah. But it starts with YOU. Islam should be a transformational force in your life & if it's not doing that then you're not applying it correctly.\n\nWhen you starve the physical body (not just food, but dopamine altogether. This means social media, porn, music, video games and sometimes food/water) the soul FEASTS the soul GORGES. It laps up whatever it can get its hands on. And if there is an abundance of healthy \"spiritual\" food in front of it, you will become strong. This is strength. This is power. This is what makes a real man. Maybe that is why we fast in Ramadan. I have no clue, but I have experienced this dopamine \"fast\" by quitting useless things in my life & now my soul is full. Ya Rabb, I am overflowing with gratitude and love.\n\nNow you're probably wondering, but u/WeekWon, where do I start? I'm drowning in sin.\n\nAsk him. He will guide you through the process. Just ask. Ask him to be your mentor. Have a HIGH opinion of Allah. He is LITERALLY the best you could have in your corner. He is rooting for you. Sometimes at the end of the night I'll sit down and talk to him. I'll tell him what I'm going to do next to try and get closer to him & what dreams and hopes I have for the future. You might receive help in the form of sudden tranquility after a prayer. He could send a message encouraging you to move forward in the form of a dream. But you won't dream if you're blocking your soul by indulging in these base desires. My name isn't u/WeekWon anymore. My name is Omar. And today I conquered my desires.", "if drawing animate beings is haram, how are we watching cartoons, reading comics and playing video games?Salaam alaikum everyone\n\nHope you have a happy Ramadan - this is not the best moment to ask such question (isnt really related to Ramadan) but its been on my mind.

Game is set in 800 A.D Baghdad, is it okay?", "Guys I have a very important question regarding video games. Please read from start to end completely and answer me as i'm very confused right now.Ok so the background is recently I saw a video of Dr Zakir Naik (amongst others) where he has said that Pubg is Haram because it has introduced idol worship in its latest update. I dont play pubg but apparently your pray to some idols and get guns,etc.\n\nVideo games can basically be divided into 2 categories that are;\n\n**1:** Video games based on the real world(the life,history,religions,countries,etc as we know to exist) (Story can be fictional but still its based on the real world that we know)\n\n**2:** Video games based on Fantasy(made up world,history,mythology,alien races,etc)\n\nYes they can be further broken into sub categories such as taking case 1 and presenting alternate history, games such as Wolfenstein regarding WW2 where Germany wins, etc but lets not go into that right now.\n\nOk so here is my understanding **regarding case 1**, Imagine there is a game where a person is a mossad agent and your mission is to bomb a Muslim Holy Site(Astagfirullah), or imagine a video game where they abuse Jesus's name(Astagfirullah) like they do in movies,songs,etc.This kind of games/entertainment I understand and totally agree that is Haraam to play because its insults Islam or the Prophets which are a part of our Faith(Emaan). Imagine a call of duty game where they have caricatures of Prophet Muhammed PBUH (Astagfirullah) on the walls of a map,etc. This is Haraam because it mocks a real religion, a real Prophet that billion look up to more then their families(Alhumdulillah)\n\nNow my understanding **regarding case 2**, Imagine a video game that is based on lore that someone in a game development company wrote up(Elder Scrolls as an example) or taken from history that we know is fake such as Norse mythology( the upcoming Assassins Creed Valhalla). We know both of these are made up worlds and do not exist. In Elder Scrolls for example there are different gods for different things such as god of time, living gods that people worship in the lore,etc. In games with greek mythology you have zeus and in norse you have odin.\n\nNow in these games you are sometimes a follower of that religion and sometimes you pray/worship to their idols and ask for their help in the games. For example you will play a Viking who believes in odin as god,etc in the upcoming Assasins Creed Valhalla game, basically you are a part of that fantasy world, a world where there are no real life religions, historical figures,etc. It's purely made up just for entertainment and playing as a game.\n\n**This is where my question comes in:** Now is playing a fantasy based game where there are several gods for different things and sometimes you help them and sometimes fight them and sometimes worship them/ask for help Haraam? Does it mean that we commit Shirk every time we play that game? I mean I know killing or stealing in a video game can't be a sin but can doing shirk in a game exist?\n\nAnswer this question if you practice Islam and have some knowldge.

I had very liberal parents, mind you. \n\nHowever, you have to realize that video games are in a virtual world that you cannot touch.  You cannot feel a game.

They do not cause me to do things I would not normally do on a daily basis.\n\nThis is why I do not put them on the same level as real games, such as chess, or paintings, or writings, or even music, which, as we know, can be haram (depending on what it is).  \nI have also looked in to this, and found that Muhammad (pbuh) would rather his followers be doing good deeds instead of playing \"worthless games,\"  but, he also said we should change with the times, and I think times have changed -- to a great extent!\n\n\nThose were just some musings of my thoughts on video games, and kind of wanted some feedback from you.", "What is the islamic attitude on playing video games like GTA V ?The main porpose of the game is doing things that would be considered haram in real life, e.g. killing, stealing, prostitution, gambling etc...", "A question about video gamesAre videos games haram, games such as league of legends and world of warcraft?

Living a natural, environmental, and community-connected life. A game which has only been out for a few weeks, has already sold half a million copies. It was developed by only one single guy, who made it while waiting to try to find a job in his field.\n> \n> The game is literally you, the player, living life as yourself, but in a natural environment with a complex yet living community. Working hard to grow food, developing relationships with fellow human beings, facing the real-life challenges with both good and bad consequences.\n> \n> As a player of the game has said, 'A game about being closer to nature and your neighbors, but is highly addictive and is keeping me indoors and alone. The irony is not lost on me.'\n> \n> Another player found the game solved an even deeper problem for him, saying 'This game did to my depression what years of anti-depressants couldn't do.'\n> \n> It begs the question, why? Why would all of these people find tranquility in a video game that they cannot find in real life? What is it about the reality of the system under which they live that has pushed them to seek a virtual system to attain peace of mind?\n> \n> We have all know those thoughts that lurk in our heads.

Why regardless of our inaction or action there are so many people suffering.\n> \n> Some blame 'the other' be it blacks, migrants, Muslims, the poor, etc. Some end up in lethargy, just giving up on any hope to find some sort of happiness. Some close their eyes and pretend nothing is wrong in the bliss of ignorance. Some try to look at the small 'good' in life and ignore the bad in the world.\n> \n> And yet we see the machine, the system of today endures.\n> \n> I have found happiness and solace in Islam. But it is not just the idea that Islam give me hope of something in the afterlife. No. It is also that it gives me a vision for the future of humanity in this world. An existence worth living for, working hard for. Where all of the common man can live a decent, respectable life. Where his neighbors would care about him as he would care about his neighbors. Where there would be little motivation for a person to use race or personal benefit for oppression of others. Where there would be value in hard work that doesn't go to some rich banker or CEO. Where you know that you can create some good in this world that would not be corrupted by the touch of money. Where you know that all your suffering would not be just your own, but an event that would be shared by all your fellow human beings in earnest.\n> \n> It is a vision that is worth aspiring to for us human beings.

It\u2019s not to feel good. It\u2019s not to feel connected. We do it because we are required to do it, like it or not, period. Sure, feeling connected is great and we should strive to get there one day iA, but that\u2019s a big difference from why we do what we do. There is a slave/master relationship here. Not a child to Santa Clause relationship. Get it straight. \n\nFreaking man up! Men stop listening and following to all this emasculating crap. Own your situation and try to get better. If you have mental issues, go to a therapist. No shame in that. Actually it should be a point of pride because you are actually trying to get better. Stop playing video games and focus on school and improving the way you look and feel about yourself. Including how you dress. You don\u2019t need money to look good. But there no excuse to look like crap. You can be the best version of yourself, in whatever capacity you have. \n\nLastly, understand your environment and what role society plays on what we consider acceptable or not. You are not unique or special. You think the way you think because of the constant messages you get 24/7 from these immoral parasites. They know how to program people and what tools to use (movies, music, media). Know that and self assess, maybe just maybe I think what I think because of all this and not because of some sort of imaginary genius that I suddenly obtained. Just two decades ago this world was drastically different morally. What changed? We got smart all of a suddenly? No way! The message changed and all us sheep went along for the ride.

TLDR at bottom, but it\u2019s too vague to get the full picture. \n\n\nLong story short, I\u2019m not sure when I woke up, but I was laying on my backside and looking to my bottom right I was in the middle of a conversation with some guy. He looked like my friend I see at the gym a lot with, nice guy.\n\nWe was literally talking about a game he wanted to build.. I think, ohh, I remember, so  when I was asleep I was dreaming of playing the game, but to me it wasn\u2019t super interesting and eventually I just wanted to drop it, but I never knew it was \u201cmy friend\u2019s\u201d game until after I wake up.\n\nSo me and this is weird entity that kinda looks like my friend are having this conversation about this game\n\nBtw, this conversation \u2014 I was communicating through my head, not words. \n\n\u201cHow long will the game take to finish? 8 months, 8 years?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c8 years \u2014 then he said something along the lines of but that\u2019s why you\u2019re low on vitamins and low on sleep so it requires more effort to play, blah blah\u201d\n\n\nSaying I need to fix up my physical health before playing the game.\n\nBtw the game was some simple 3rd person exploring\u2026 supposed combat game. (I know this sounds wayyy too random.)\n\nI said \u201cit\u2019s not about sleep that\u2019s stopping me from playing\u201d\n\nHe sounded almost annoyed at that point.\n\nThen I asked more questions like \u201cwill it be high resolution?\u201d Since when I was playing it\u2026 it didn\u2019t have such great quality..\n\nHe got even more offended.\n\nThen I asked, \u201cwill it only be 3rd person?\u201d\n\nThen bro literally got up and came up to my face and we had a literal stare down lol. I couldn\u2019t see its actual face, or anything, it was just a figure of its face\u2026 when I got up to investigate (and probably fight it) It ended up just being a towel dangling from my bunk bed lol. (No ones sleeping above there.) \n\nBut yeah\u2026 I\u2019m wondering what this actually was? Just a waking dream? Imagination? A jinn? Not sure. \n\nTLDR: I think i had\u201cconversation\u201d with an insecure jinn when waking up talking about his video game, I didn\u2019t particularly find it my taste and he kinda got up in my face, ended up being a towel.\u201d Still think it\u2019s a weird encounter tho.", "Why is the world so sexualized? I mean, just look anywhere. Most billboards you see on the highway will no have women wearing hijabs (even Malaysia has billboards with awrah). Most movies you see will have nudity (I think Sonic 2 doesn't have them). The songs you hear on the radio will most likely have sexual lyrics. I am a die hard gamer, but even I have to admit a lot of video games nowadays have sexualised women (alhamdulillah Sonic does not have that feature). Its so scary to think that the pornography is a trillion dollar industry (may Allah destroy the porn industry).

People drink, do zina, whatever else is haram. I\u2019m talking about everyone not just Muslims.\n\nAlso I feel like the majority of people don\u2019t even really care or know that one religion might be the truth. Most people just live their life with the religion they were born into. Yeah there are converts into Islam or other religions.\n\nI was born into Islam but I wish I were a convert low key. They have so much respect for our religion, they know it\u2019s the truth 100%. Plus doesn\u2019t he love them more or something as compared to born Muslims I don\u2019t know. Some people say that.\n\nAlso for men anyway he\u2019s giving us this such strong desire but then made masturbation haram. Like I can\u2019t take this anymore. I have done ghusl so many times. SO MANY. \n\nAnd every time I\u2019m in the shower I\u2019m like \u201cthis is the last time\u201d and it\u2019s never true. I don\u2019t fear zina, I\u2019m a virgin and honestly I would feel too shy to have sex \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.\n\nI\u2019m definitely cursing myself by saying this but how do Muslim guys do zina. Like are they extremely good looking or something lol. I mean if I put in effort to look good I probably could. But I don\u2019t lol also I don\u2019t have a lot of confidence with girls. If a girl asked me for sex I honestly wouldn\u2019t take her up on it.\n\nThe only time I can think of me doing zina would be like after marriage (not saying I want to do it, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s the only time I can see myself falling into the sin). Cause then I won\u2019t be a virgin anymore so sex won\u2019t be some thing that idk. iA I won\u2019t do zina tho.\n\nAlso I got held back a year in grad school. Which delays my graduation by a whole year. Which I guess delays my marriage by a year. I don\u2019t know. People say he\u2019s the provider of Rizq so u should get married, like get married he\u2019ll enrich u of ur bounty. That makes no sense to me. Like I get he\u2019s God he controls everything including how much money people make. But like so if I get married money will magically fall from the sky into my hand? I know he has the power to do that but I also know that he will not do it lol. \n\nMade dua for me to like not be held back a year. He was like nope. And now he\u2019s not even gonna give me back the time I spent writing the email to the dean. I\u2019m a good email writer too. I\u2019m not good in real time conversations AT ALL lol but give me time to write something and it will be great.\n\nI don\u2019t know. I was like why are you doing this to me to him but it\u2019s my fault. Not his that failed. It\u2019s not like I tried my hardest and failed, it\u2019s that I didn\u2019t rlly try I guess.\n\nI was talking to a girl about marriage but unfortunately. Umm. Yeah there\u2019s a lot to the story but the result is that she said no. And this happened like first week of August\u2026I\u2019m still heartbroken and down bad over her. I mean that\u2019s what led me back to Islam but I don\u2019t know it\u2019s like how religious I am always changes. One day I will read the whole Quran in an hour (exaggeration for y\u2019all who are gonna mention this lol) and other days I make posts like this. \n\nAlso I have a bad habit of spending a lot of money and maxing my credit card. I\u2019ve done it twice. This being the second time. I got really depressed over the being held back thing so I was like let me spend this money, it\u2019ll make u feel better.\n\nYeah no. Now I\u2019m sad for one extra reason, no money. Anyway I have a year so I\u2019ll get a job, spend the money on a video game I play.\n\nI\u2019m done writing this. Should I get married tho so that I can relieve myself sexually without sinning. Fasting does not work on me, I haven\u2019t tried like formal no eating till Maghrib fasting. But I have terrible eating habits, I\u2019ll go the whole day without eating and still touch myself so it doesn\u2019t rlly do anything for me. \n\nWhat girl would wanna marry me tho, I have no high paying job and won\u2019t have one for like at least 5 years, maybe even 6-7 depending on if I wanna do residency or fellowship in my field. Btw I know this sounds like med school but it\u2019s not so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna be rich or anything.\n\nAlso I\u2019d wanna marry a girl here in the US, my brother married a girl from Pakistan in Jan of 22. But obviously he has work and he\u2019s not rich so he can\u2019t like see her that often. He\u2019s actually leaving for his honeymoon w her tomorrow so he will see her real soon. But that\u2019s not the point.\n\nIf I married a girl in Pakistan like there would be no benefit she would be thousands of miles away from me so it\u2019s not like she could relieve me sexually. \n\nMy mom thinks girls from Pakistan would make for better wives tho. Just cause of how life is there. She also thinks girls from the US would be very demanding, and she\u2019s seen that with one of her cousins. She had such high standards for a husband. She\u2019s married now but.\n\nAnyway yeah I\u2019m done.\n\nOh yeah also I wish I was never born but apparently I consented to being born, he gathered all our souls or something like that and then asked us if we wanted to come down to this world to worship him. But then he made us forget that when he actually made us because it would make our test super easy. And of course he can\u2019t have that.\n\nAlso what about people with major disabilities/no sound mind. Do they go to Jannah? If so, how is it fair that us people with sound minds have to bust our buts off reading Quran praying fasting giving charity to maybe still go to hell while these people go to Jannah for free, just because they do not have a sound mind. My brother has a disability and medical conditions, no sound mind. Sometimes I really wish I were him. For this reason, free Jannah. Do they go to Jannah? I don\u2019t know let me know if u guys know if he will go to Jannah or not. It wouldn\u2019t be fair, but I guess his test wasn\u2019t fair to start with.\n\nLike someone that\u2019s homeless, an orphan, and has to care for like a few younger siblings of course he won\u2019t have time to pray and worship him. Him being God. \n\nBtw this scenario in the last paragraph is not mine thank God, just in case it seems that that\u2019s the case.\n\nAnyway yeah \n\nHasn\u2019t he set us up to fail", "Doubts and questions...straying awayThese last months I've been questioning my religion a lot...it started first when going to the mosque felt like nothing anymore...second when people started criticizing my life saying I'm going to hell for certain things and I know themselves do worse...some self proclaimed knowing all about Islam are absolutely toxic and I hate that I share a religion with them...I have few questions on this matter so please explain to me without critics...I'm trying to restore my faith, it happens...\n\n1- Being a Muslim that prays regularly and has never done any of the big sins in my life up until now, I'm nice i'm kind or so that is what others say about me I try to help people when I can and I'm generally a very decent innocent guy...so my question is how come a guy like me will go to hell because I have hobbies? listening to music( not bad music or violent music just the very chill peaceful kind that would cheers you up when you are down) I also have a talent for drawing and I don't think that will ever lead me to worship idols and status lol, I play video games with friends when I have time...to me all these sound pretty normal and harmless, just because there are irresponsible people out there who take it way too far with these things that I also have to stop it or else I'm gonna go to hell?...it doesn't make sense to me! \n\n2- Another question I have is why women have to wear hijab or burka? I agree that a woman should dress appropriately... not too much skin and not too tight, just something modest but islam isn't satisfied with just that and I don't get it basically this religion is calling me a horny wild animal r*pist when I see a woman without hijab I will instantly grow a boner and start fiddling my flesh flute wanting intercourse!...there is nothing wrong with showing hair...I don't get it...this extremism Islam has towards some things makes me wonder does Allah really know me?", "[Ramadan] - Welcome! / Rules of Fasting / ReminderAssalamu \u2018alaykum wa rahmatulLahi wa barakatuh,\n\nMay the peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you all.\n\nAll praises and thanks is due to God, we are soon to reach the month of Ramadan once again, and I hope we are all super excited, insha'Allah.

I think we should really focus on striving hard this Ramadan to regain a footing on our iman, that which our relationships are based upon - if we are in a lull, I want us to get out of it, if we are on a high, I want us to maintain it. I want us to get excited and eager to please Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, this Ramadan. In Surat Al-Waqi\\`ah, Allah says that there are three kinds of people, those of the left hand, those of the right hand, and those who are *as-Sabiqoon*, but who are those? The ones that are the forerunners, the ones that are nearest to Allah. I don't want us to settle for the right hand, I know we can always do better, I know we can be of *as-Sabiqoon.*\n\nRamadan is also, and primarily, the month of the Qur'an! For those that do not know, Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed in. As Muslims today, and ever since the time of the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, we stand in prayer every night during *taraweeh* for hours after we finish our fast and recite the Qur'an, 1/30th of it every night for 30 nights, so by the end of the month we have recited the entire Qur'an!\n\n**For a brief overview of rulings regarding fasting and other things during Ramadan, please** [**click here**](https://www.islamicity.org/5331/islamic-legal-rules-of-fasting/)**.**\n\n**For a Ramadan planner to help you organize your month, please** [**click here**](https://www.islamicreliefcanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IR-RamadanAgenda.pdf)**.**\n\nFor our non-Muslim brothers and sisters, please feel welcome to join in on the fasting, setting yourself some goals to work on this month (many people try things like no smoking, less or no video games, etc.), and just being in the spirit of things - and keep asking questions!

If it feels like I am jumping around here, it is because I sincerely don't know where to start. I need some advice about how to help my brother-in-law.\n\nI used to get along with him quite well, as he is a very nice, passionate, and interesting person. Until now I have been non-judgmental and have kept my mouth shut when he has misbehaved, but his behavior has worsened in the last few months and I don't think this will work itself out. Recent interactions with him have triggered a gut feeling that he might hurt himself if things continue to get worse. As I have gotten older, I have learned to listen to this gut feeling\n\n# Ongoing Concerns\n\nI will preface this by saying that my brother-in-law is very sensitive, and suffered some serious childhood trauma from both of his parents. He was born here in the United States, but his parents are both from Pakistan. His father has acknowledged some of it privately with me and is regretful, but neither of us are sure what to do here. My wife has told me about a lot of it to give me some context. I will not repeat it here, but this would have affected *anyone* negatively. Even though we all have to take responsibility for ourselves as we get older, I sincerely believe that his initial circumstances are not his fault.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* He started using marijuana a few years ago in his parents' house, without them knowing at first. His father eventually found out, and even though he disapproved he helped him get a medical card for it so he could buy it legally and avoid trouble with the law. He claims to use it for his anxiety, but he severely abuses it. I have seen marijuana help a few people in extreme circumstances (older people with debilitating pain or arthritis, sick cancer patients who use it to help regain an appetite, etc.), but I feel there are more appropriate treatments out there for anxiety for people like him. I'm no doctor, but from my perspective he is just getting high all the time and this does not seem to be helping him.\n* He still lives at home (he is almost 30), but disrespects his father in front of me and the rest of the family in ways I cannot believe (even in the United States). He expects everything of his in the house to be paid for, and the only thing I have ever seen him do to help around the house is take out the trash a few times. I have seen him wake up and demand his mother make him breakfast on more than one occasion while he sits at the table and plays on his phone. I have also seen him get in screaming matches with his father about petty things like not bringing certain foods in the house because it will make him fat, even though he buys and eats junk food all the time and it is his father's house.\n* His sleep is completely inconsistent, as he plays video games all night in his room and wakes up at random times in the morning or afternoon.\n* When he takes time off from work, he stays at home and just plays video games for days and nights straight.\n* His father pushed him to finish his Master's degree, and helped him get a great job at an *amazing* company. He is *very* smart and capable, but he does all of his work at the last minute, barely finishes it, has turned a few things in late, and never goes above and beyond on anything. His managers have started to notice this pattern, and since he is new I privately worry that he would be among the first people laid off if the company cut back given the impending recession.\n* He has unsuccessfully tried on several occasions to turn me against his father by lying, gossiping, and backbiting with no shame whatsoever.\n* He does not have very many friends, and the ones I am aware of do not seem to be good influences.\n* In the past, he hit his mom as a teenager. Though he regrets this now, this is still extremely concerning and I get the feeling that he would hit a future wife.\n* He has no experience with girls, but not in a purely good way. Avoiding temptation and zina is desirable, but he does not even demonstrate appropriate social skills when talking to other men or women in his family most of the time, so this is concerning.\n* On a few occasions, he spoke to me forcefully with enormous disrespect demanding things that I refused, then had his sister (my wife) and father check in to make sure I am not upset with him.\n* **Most concerning of all:** he has told me privately that he \"identifies as a Muslim\" but does not believe in God and is actually an atheist (may Allah SWT help him). At the same time, he has told me that he is interested in exploring Hinduism and Sikhism because he is Punjabi and feels like those were the religions of his forefathers. I have not pointed out to him that Sikhism came much later than Islam, but I digress.\n\n# Recent Behavior\n\nAfter our Nikkah, he was sincerely happy for us and decided that he also wanted to get married. He asked his mother to find him a bride from Pakistan for an arranged marriage. He even started going to Jummah. This seemed great at first, but as time went on it started to seem like he was doing this to find a wife more than worship Allah.\n\nHe started attending more Pakistani events, openly evaluating potential girls and saying hurtful things about them to his mom like \"She is fat, but she has a good job so we would have a lot of money, so she would be ok. Can you talk to her parents?\" I pray that none of the things he said reached these girls or their families.\n\nHe also started drinking alcohol with his friends. About a month ago I overheard him asking his father to trust him about something while I was working at their house. A few minutes later he came to me and said he was going to hang out with some friends to drink. He asked me which wines were the best to buy, assuming that because I am a convert I know a lot about this. Trying to avoid confrontation, I told him that there was an enormous amount to learn about wine, that I was no expert, and that it should be *avoided*. He kept asking, so I eventually told him that if he was going to drink to at least make sure he *never* drove afterwards. Guess what? He did that night.\n\nI really did not appreciate this whole interaction. If I ever told his parents I knew about him drinking then he would never trust me again, but if I don't say anything then I feel I am doing nothing to help him. I am a bit angry about this and feel like he is taking advantage of my honor and loyalty to him as a brother and a man.\n\nNeedless to say, I am very concerned for him. I want him to be happy and get married one day, but I unequivocally DO NOT think that he should get married right now because he has a lot of work to do on himself. He would not be a good husband to *anyone* yet. His lack of experience with girls could be attractive to some of the more devout Muslim sisters out there, but this lack of experience has more to do with his personal difficulties than devotion to Islam, as he is also an atheist.\n\nMy father-in-law wants me to help guide him any way I can, but my brother-in-law resents this insistence that we hang out together, and it may have damaged our relationship. We don't live in the same city anymore, so it is difficult to spend time with him. I have tried reaching out just to talk to him, but sometimes he dodges my calls or does not respond to my texts for several days. My wife and I invited him to visit us a couple of months ago, and while he was initially very excited about this he changed his mind at the last minute and has avoided us since. When we visited a few weeks ago he literally avoided us for two days straight by staying in his room, saying he was sick (I am skeptical of this because he had one of his friends over when he thought we wouldn't be home), and blatantly ignoring us when we talked to him in such an odd way that made me think he was taking some drugs.\n\nIn my family (mixed American), we address things directly and with love, but Pakistani culture is very different and I feel obligated to follow the father's lead to keep the peace. I do not want to overstep my bounds with him and do or say something that upsets my wife or the family.\n\nI believe that he is depressed and hurting on the inside, and that he is a very sensitive and loving person. I honestly fear setting them over the edge into a rage, crippling depression, or worse. Still, I am worried that if things get worse he might hurt himself or someone else by accident (saying something unacceptable, drunk driving).\n\nI am open to any advice you have about dealing with this Islamically.\n\nPlease make dua for him.", "Can I talk to a girl online?

It is heralded as one of the greatest video games ever made. In the game there is a place you come to called the \"Fire Temple\". In here the music that plays which I will leave a link for below was one of my favorite songs from the game. It really does make you feel like you are in such a place. One of the spookiest elements is the chanting. When I was a kid I had no idea it was actual words, I thought it was just sounds, but apparently there are actual words for a language I do not speak. These words are some Islamic Prayer which according to places I read on the internet say  **\"I bear witness that there is no God but Allah.\"**   \n\n\nZelda isn't about religion or Islam in any way but like many things it takes in inspiration to build its own world. The thing is that when the ported the game to the gamecube and 3ds they changed the song to remove the chanting because they thought the chanting would be offensive and after seeing what the words are I am struggling to see their reasoning why.   \n\n\nDo you believe this song to be offensive? If so why? Or do you think that Nintendo was just being overly sensitive? To me the chanting gives the temple a more religious or sacred but also a spooky feeling to it. Like somewhere inside there is monks praying to their fire deity that you never get to meet.   \n\n\n  \nOriginal song.   \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGnJF1R0WU&ab\\_channel=NadlMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGnJF1R0WU&ab_channel=NadlMo)   \n\n\nThe song after they changed it.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhyBCEEX4RE&ab\\_channel=AacroXtensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhyBCEEX4RE&ab_channel=AacroXtensions)", "so i made an Argentine steam account, I do not live in Argentine, is it haram?more context for those who didn't understand. steam is a platform where i can buy video games, to increase sales depending on countries the price of a product can increase or decrease, so for example people in Turkey now (due to the currency) own less money than before because the value of the currency decreased, so steam will make a 60$ game worth like 10$ in Turkey only and not other countries, that's why i made an Argentine account where games are cheaper. is it okay to buy games using the account?\n\nplease use as much evidence as possible when answering", "Getting raised by a Christian mother and will start to live with a Muslim father soon?Growing up I was raised by a Christian mother who I think isn't even **that Christian**.

My parents however feel that other religions may be better for me. But I just feel \u201ccalled\u201d to Islam. They also feel that Islam is oppressive towards women and if you do your research you\u2019ll know that that\u2019s not true. They are also worried about me getting bullied which is normal.

Of course I will make an effort to learn Arabic but would it be okay to pray in English? \n\nIf I do convert, would I have to wear a head scarf around my parents who aren\u2019t Muslim? \n\nAre video games and YouTube haram?

Is it implied? \n\nDo you guys believe in science? I really don\u2019t mean to be rude but what do you guys do when it comes to science opposing something that Islam says is true?

To make long story short since I was age 13 I was surrounded with drugs and criminal activities.. I've been taking drugs since I was 18 and stopped doing hard drugs since I was 20 and stayed only on weed since than. I was also an alcoholic, drug dealer and overall bad person.. \nI have never considered myself as a Muslim and I found religion really strict.. anyways. Few month back as I stayed at my buddy's house we were just chilling and playing video games and I heard Hadji from the mosque over microphones they have installed and the sound was just getting stronger and stronger like he was talking only to me and in a minute I got sober.. \nSo I came to the point where I am feeling like I need to find myself and find my religion again I trully feel attracted to the Islam again, but I have a problem. \nI have attraction toward weed as it was a huge part of my life and I like to smoke from time to time. \n\nHow big problem is that and can I still get into the religion with that sin of mine ?\n\nI stopped smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, doing everything else. I have never stole anything, killed anyone, cheated on my girl or ruined my families life. \nNone of my previous life is interesting to me and I have turned my life around for good, however I still have that one sin of mine as I consider everybody has a sin they don't want to talk about even religious people.\nEither is that to talk bad about somebody, look at women, slur and stuff like that. So I really don't believe my problem and sin is so big I can't be religious person, but I want to hear your thoughts on this, as I don't have anyone to talk about this.\n\nThanks", "Further questionsHello there,\n\nI'm unsure if anyone remembers me but i posted here previously. Just to fill in context from then until now, I went to a mosque spoke to an imam and i have a translated Quran. Onto questions, they should be fairly brief.\n\nFirstly, when I read the Quran, it is certainly an interesting book, but I cannot help but notice the fact that when people speak in the Quran, they all have the same speech patterns. As in they all speak in the same sort of way. This surely wouldn't be possible, as people in Moses' time certainly spoke differently to how Mary would have spoken, for example. I find it odd, could anyone enlighten me on this?\n\nSecondly, Surah 5 verse 116-118 says\n\n>And \\[beware the Day\\] when Allah will say, \"O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah\u00a0?'\" He will say, \"Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it.\n\nChristians don't worship Mary. Yet this seems to indicate the belief that Christians do, in fact, worship Mary. I reiterate again that this is false. I read the entire Surah in case anyone tells me to look at context. Again I'd ask for someone to shed light on this?\n\nThirdly, From my understanding Zayd bin Thabit was the personal scribe to Muhammad and the one who collected all the verses into one book. In Islam, the Quran is the unaltered word of God. Was there anything stopping him from just not putting a verse in if he didn't like it?  Would this not hamper any claim that could say the Quran is 100% unaltered? It seems an unknown variable to me, that's all.\n\nIn addition, In the night journey where Muhammad ascends to heaven, why was there a negotiation about the prayers. As in God wanted the people to do 50 prayers but Muhammad negotiated the amount to 5, that seems odd to me. God wanted 50 so surely we should have had to do 50, questioning that saying its too much and even asking God to lower it because humans don't think they can do it, is that not contrary to submission to God?\n\nFinally, i see talk of \"Earning good deeds\", and that on the day of judgement these good deeds will be weighed against your bad deeds. I apologize for phrasing it like I'm about to but I can't think of a better way to. The way its been presented to me reminds me of getting XP in video games. I see talk of \"Farming good deeds\" or \"the best way get good deeds\". I apologize if this comes across as insensitive but it seems almost childish to me. Isthe whole thing being presented wrong? Or am I missing something important?", "please save me brothers and sisters, read more belowI am 19 years old. I have been muslim my whole life.

My brother is 30 years old. He has the capacity and time to get at least a part time job doing Uber or doordash or one of those app jobs if he wanted to but chooses not to. Outside of school, he prefers to play video games, chase girls, and work out. He will be 30 next month and I think this is quite sad that a 30 year old man still depends this much on his parents/family.

The issue we have now is my father decided to stop supporting my brother and stopped paying for his schooling. No real reason (my father is not a very good guy in general so this isn\u2019t actually that surprising).

It is completely entwined with my life journey and my literal body. Or so i think, at least. So, I feel I must share it here. Because I'm all alone with no Muslim brothers or sisters around me with whom I can share this because if I do it might disturb their regular routine to read this long story. So I need to share with strangers. My final submission to God has happened in total isolation after reading the 1st two chapters of the Qur'an. I read in English, with transliteration, and I am still in the process of reading it. I have not finished it yet to be frank but I have absolutely no doubt about it (apparently, all i needed were the first two chapters). I am doing this slowly also because I love it and I'm relishing each and every word, makes me feel like rolling around in ecstasy to be frank \ud83d\ude02. I have literally fallen in love. Since then, the only people who know of this (and are trying to understand) are all pagans and polytheists, they do not understand the concept of One God at all and it becomes very hard to communicate and eventually it feels like I'm an alien. Which is ironic because faith and belief are things that should connect one to the larger stream of life and here i am losing friends and family and actually feeling lighter and happier because I literally have been unable to stand idol-worshipping ever since I was a kid.\n\nThis brings me to my childhood. I was born in an Upper Caste (Kayastha), hindi-speaking, middle-class, joint family (grandfather, uncles, aunts all living together about 10 people in the house at any time). I have been raised by a devout mother and an atheist/agnostic father. In Hinduism, you really don't have to believe anything to be a Hindu, just follow the rituals. There have been sects of Hinduism in the past that have neither believed in God nor Revelation, having a materialist philosophy of the world, and they have also been included as Hindu (Charavaka, Lokayata, Buddhism, Jainism etc).\n\nComing back to my childhood, since a very early age my mother taught me to pray. She couldn't teach me any set prayer though because there is no one way in Hinduism, there are set rituals and hymns but no set prayers. The one thing I remember again and again is prostration. We had a tiny temple in the house, like many people, and the first act of worship I was told to perform was to prostrate myself before the idols. I loved doing that, to lie down flat and face down and hands joined. That was the only way I understood to pray. But I had no words to speak. And the hymns made no sense.\n\nAn aside about my mother, she is trained in Hindustani Classical music (she did her masters in it) and is a retired teacher of music. She was raised by a VERY devout man, who was a professor of fine arts. He used to get up at 4 in the morning, wake up all his children to pray, then practice their arts and studies. My mother prays everyday and fasts 3 times a week. She has been doing this all her life because loves doing it.\n\nNow, I studied in a missionary school. And there, I was being raised half-Christian in a way. The first time I saw the story of the Passion, I remember being terrified and awe-struck at the same time. It filled me with a LOT of dread, for some reason reason I couldn't understand. How could this be done to a man like that? My childhood brain couldn't process. We had the Cross in every classroom back then (not anymore, though, I don't know why). I loved the hymns and the prayers. I still sing them. These were the first prayers and hymns I could understand and relate to.\n\nAs I grew, I became increasingly disgusted with idol-worship, already i could see the problems with it. Problems with the very concept. And studying in a Christian school didn't help because you know how Monotheists look at idol-worship and paganism. And it concurred with my REASON. Moreover, I was passionate about Science, History and English Literature at school which promoted atheistic/agnostic thinking. Eventually, I entered a reluctant disbelief. I still could not accept atheism because it didn't agree with my reason either. In this way I journeyed from innocence to agnosticism.\n\nBy the time I was finishing school I was a video-game addict and spent all my time bunking school entirely, stealing money from home to pay at the game-parlor, eating junk food, and just playing games from 8am to 8pm. In this way, I ruined my 11th and 12th grade completely and was barely able to pass school. Thank heavens i did though because if I hadn't my father was willing to throw me out of the house \ud83d\ude02. I was a student of Biology and wanted to become a doctor but couldn't study, since I have never been the diligent kind. Eventually I entered a law school, it is a VERY prestigious law school (ranks 3rd or 4th in the country) this made my parents happy again. I cracked the exam without even studying, like i said I am not very diligent, but i have always been very bright and sharp and learn quickly. So, I started law school but my heart wasn't in it. Frankly, my heart was nowhere to be found, except in hanging out with my friends listening to music and smoking weed (I've never liked alcohol though, I hate it). So that was how spent some crucial years of my life very irresponsibly.\n\nIn law school, i kept getting debarred from the exams because of lack of attendance and eventually quit it after 3 years. Everyone was pretty mad. I wanted to study philosophy by that time. But no university would take me. Eventually, I gave the English Literature exam at Jamia Millia Islamia and was accepted. I had topped the entrance exam and interview there. However, my lack of hard work and abhorrence of classrooms again fucked up my life and it took me 6 years to graduate from a 3 year course. BUT it was there at Jamia that i first started living with in very close proximity with Muslims and actually started understanding Islam, I was surrounded by the culture now. It felt like home away from home, because I am from Bhopal (a city in the state of Madhya Pradesh/Central Provice, India) and Bhopal has a sizeable Muslim population and a deep connection with Islam. I made my first best friend there at Jamia. We used to sit for hours everyday just yakking, he loved video-games as well, from an animators perspective, and also biology, evolution, and history so I finally found a friend to talk with. And it is from him that I came to know about many things Islamic/Abrahamic. He believed in God but was not a practicing Muslim. And I liked that because I didn't like organized religions by that time. By this time, I had become sort of a \"libertarian\".\n\nYears passed. Finally, I passed out of Jamia and began my Master's in English Literature from Delhi University. Again a VERY prestigious place because I secured 4th rank in the entrance. But then like previously got debarred and failed exams badly and took 4 years to complete a 2 year degree. This ended with my first job as an Assistant Editor. At 29 years of age. At DUni, the very first year I joined a study group called \"The Bible as Literature\" this is where I first started reading the Bible. I wanted to read it with guidance and here was my chance. Though, I went to a missionary school i had never read it. In the study group we read the Torah part of the Old Testament alongside commentary and everything, diligently. I also took up Buddhist Studies as part of my Master's. For the next few years I kept meditating on all that I had understood by that time. I eventually rejected Buddhism (I can elaborate on the reasons why Buddhism is wrong, but not here). I realised I was still trying to find an \"answer\" to something, how to live (?). A religious answer no doubt, and it was a religious question. Both the question and answer, unformulated and inarticulatable. But my journey from disbelief to faith had begun.\n\nAfter a few years, things happened in my life that made me eventually become clinically depressed (diagnosed). Around this time, there was a Gideon's Bible i had found in the hotel room where I was staying at the time. And I thought of turning to the New Testament. To find \"an answer\" to my \"problem\". Reading the Gospels was a moving experience that had me in tears and showed me a light at the end of the tunnel. Over time, my meditation on Jesus as the Word brought results and slowly but surely I was being lifted out of my despair. However, there was still something missing. I couldn't feel completely at ease. Something very essential was missing. A guidance. The New Testament as it stands has something missing.\n\nA few years passed, and I moved back from Delhi to Bhopal in 2020 due to the pandemic. Now, here I was gifted with a Qur'an by a pagan friend who had no need for it but had picked it up because it was free and looked beautiful. But that guy is not interested in reading ANYTHING, so he gave it to me who loved to read.\n\nAfter Diwali, a festival Hindus celebrate, we Kayasthas, the caste of scribes, make a special worship. Our caste reveres a \"god\" called Chitragupta Maharaj (the name has many \"hidden\" meanings) and we believe that we have descended from that god (like i said, we are upper caste). He is the god who keeps the accounts the deeds of men and is the secretary of the Warden of the Underworld (Yama). Following this, our traditional jobs have been administration and accounting. We were the first people in India to learn Persian and all other foreign languages so that administration could be done (we have been doing this since 2 millenia \ud83d\ude02). We worship the Pen and Paper on that day. We write \"Om\" and keep our pens/pencils and copies in the tiny temple and refrain from writing anything that day. Only worship the Word. But very few Kaysthas today understand this. Like I said I have never been able to stand idol-worshipping, or the concept of Idols in the first place. And by this time something had happened and I was already planning on reading the Qur'an. I knew enough to just start reading. And so on this day, as my way of worship, I started reading the Qur'an.\n\nI was stunned just after the fatiha to be frank \ud83d\ude33 I had no idea THIS existed!! Then I kept on reading. I finished al-baqarah by the next day. Then I re-read that very day the whole thing at least 2-3 times. By the evening, I was just sitting stunned and dreamy. It was like the greatest burden of my life had been lifted from me. I was sooo dreamy, I remember. Just kept sitting on my bed in silence for at least 3-4 hrs. Eventually, the first question that comes to my mind is \"what the fuck year is this?????\" Then I looked up the Hijri calendar and realised that civilization began for sure 1400 years ago. It was like waking from a deep slumber. A slumber of centuries. And felt completely awake. Since that day, my life has begun. I found myself in the Qur'an. My purpose, which is to pray, and my name, which was always my name, from aya 282 of albaqarah, and I understood I was a Katib (scribe), this particular katib mentioned along with his duty, this is what I was and am. I was shown the world, and my place in the world. The Qur'an baptized me once and for all. My life has, finally, begun and I can't tell you how happy it makes me. My eyes have been opened by a miracle of God. This is all I wanted to share, for now.\n\nAllah hafiz.\n\nPS Please feel free to leave any comments that strike you at first reading this, positive or negative. To hear from someone, that was why I wrote this huge wall of text that was, frankly, very difficult to write.

Also its preferred if another girl gives me an advice. It\u2019s totally fine if a man reads this but I feel like a girl can understand my situation more :). Ok so where do I even start: ever since I was about to turn 18 and after I turned 18 (which was about 8 months ago) I started really dreaming about getting married. I don\u2019t know I just started having desires, not the unholy stuff (even though I think about that every now and then) but the wholesome desires where I would feel loved and in love to relate to each other and strengthening each other\u2019s deen and being happy, you know how there are some things you can tell your friends but not tell your family. Or tell your family but not tell your friends. I feel like you can tell everything to your husband though. The thing is that I\u2019m still 18 and I wanna finish my bachelors degree first just like all of my family did ( in my family education is very important and I\u2019m not planning to ignore it either) and I\u2019m still in my first semester in college plus I\u2019m not interested in anyone at the moment because I have unbelievable very high expectations (the nerdish dream of playing video games and watching anime together:D) but I do believe that Allah will bring me the right person at some point in time who is perfect for me and all I gotta do is make dua. The thing is that I can\u2019t approach my family about this because,although they are very understanding and thoughtful, they\u2019ll tell me that I\u2019m too young and I don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll react. I mean I don\u2019t even have a person in mind and as I\u2019ve said my expectations are so high to the point that I have to go from country to another to find the right person haha. But again I\u2019m totally putting my trust in Allah in this. So my questions are\n\nCan you give me your opinions about this ?\n\nIs there any dua I can read daily that would help me?\n\nIs there anyone who was in my situation and managed to find the right person?\n\nPlease give me all the advice you can give :)", "Will it be haram for me to call myself \u201cbringer of light\u201d?This is probably a dumb question, but that is my gaming name \ud83e\udd74 As a kid, I had come up with a fictional story (I hope I was not the only kid who did that, lol).

May Allah all allow us to witness this Eid al-Adha.  \n\n### Spending Time With Family\n\nEid al-Adha is a perfect time to spend time with family, spending time with family members you only see on special occasions such as Eid al-Adha. Catch up with distant relatives and with your family members. Create new memories,  reminisce the old ones and, in general, have fun with the family. \n\n### Having BBQ \n\nAs most people on Eid al-Adha buy an animal and sacrifice them. This is a perfect time to have a BBQ with the family and friends and enjoy food. Also, make sure to give the leftovers to neighbours or friends ;).  \n\n### Playing Games (Not Video Games, Physical Activities)\n\nPlaying games with family well I might as well say sports is a great way to reconnect with family and create memories. This one is mostly for the younger people but the elders can join too. Here's a list of activities/sports you can do:\n\n* **Archery** \\-   Narrated Uqbah ibn Amir**:** Everything with which a man amuses himself is vain except three (things): a man's training of his horse, his playing with his wife, and his shooting with his bow and arrow.\n* **Running** \\-  It was narrated that 'Aishah said**:** \"The Prophet raced with me and I beat him.  Sunan Ibn Majah 1979 \"\n* **Swimming** \\- It was narrated that Abu Unma mah bin Sahl said**:** \u2018Umar wrote to Abu\u02bcUbaidah bin al-Jarrah \\[saying\\]: Teach your children swimming and teach your fighters archery. \n\n### Remembering People In Need\n\nEid al-Adha is the time when Ibrahim (AS) had a dream that he believed was a sign/message from Allah (SWT) asking him to sacrifice his son Ismail and where you spend time with family and friends. Also, make sure to remember the people in need and make sure to make some food for the people in need and donate it to them. May Allah shower you with blessings if you do donate the food you have made to people that need it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sunnahs to do on Eid al-Adha I will provide websites for this information:\n\nWebsite #1 - [https://www.muslimaid.org/media-centre/blog/sunnah-practice-on-eid-ul-adha/](https://www.muslimaid.org/media-centre/blog/sunnah-practice-on-eid-ul-adha/)\n\nWebsite #2 - [https://turntoislam.com/community/threads/20-sunnah](https://turntoislam.com/community/threads/20-sunnah%E2%80%99s-to-do-on-eid-al-adha.101245/)\n\nWebsite #3 - [https://theislamicinformation.com/blogs/7-sunnahs-eid/](https://theislamicinformation.com/blogs/7-sunnahs-eid/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this will help you enjoy this Eid al-Adha as always remember Allah make sure to pray your daily 5 prayers, May Allah grant us all Jannah.", "About taking money from gambling companiesSalam wonderful brothers and sisters.

And call him all sorts of insults for what they think is a child. What makes me more annoyed is some of the Muslim responses to these comments bring up false information to try to meet the western narrative of what is allowed in modern times. Some of them state, oh no, she was 18, and try to jumble around a bunch of hadith to try to prove it to fit our time standards. Some will even reject hadith as not authentic and say to follow only the Quran..... I'm talking about a certain subreddit full of \"progressive\" Muslims. I will now present some information to those that don't know enough about the religion to defend this. If you rather watch a video of Shiekh Uthman do so, here it is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLN7Rf\\_9h-A&t=1056s&ab\\_channel=The3Muslims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLN7Rf_9h-A&t=1056s&ab_channel=The3Muslims)\n\nSo we have a sahih hadith that does say the prophet married Aisha at the age of 9. Now whether that is the case or not should not matter. You can argue that it was actually not that simple to keep track of age 1400 years ago, and she could have been older since the Arabs had no calendar back then. This could definitely be true, as you are not going to be conscious at birth and start keeping track of age. However, people need to stop looking at this from the modern age and pondering over it so much, even if the hadith was 100% accurate, then look below.\n\n1. 1400 years ago the average lifespan was 30 years of age.  If you think someone back then should have married at 18, then you are an idiot. When you have a lower lifespan, people are going to marry and mature earlier. Even if you look at this from a logical perspective, we have an average lifespan of 70 in modern times, and many people marry at 18 or younger, does it not make sense if the lifespan is half , people would marry around 9. A girl at 9 is not going to be the same level of maturity as a girl at 9 today. Islam always looks at both mental and physical maturity for marriage.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dk9w207s2bca1.png?width=1343&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2681d200db443c78dec334274b434f219945bb57\n\n2.  People love to claim that Aisha was a child and very immature. They will often throw a hadith about her playing with dolls at you to prove this. However, they miss that Aisha was actually supposed to marry another man before she married the prophet, but the marriage was called off since the family feared she would have an influence on their son converting to Islam. Which just demonstrates her intelligence and maturity. A large variety of hadiths are narrated by her. She has contributed largely to Islamic knowledge. She was by no means immature. Many adults today play games, or entertain themsleves with something to pass time. 1400 years ago there was probably very little to do with entertainment, so that does not equate to immaturity, and I would not blame anyone wanting to pass time.\n\n3. The hypocrisy of Christians and others is funny to me. Many US states for example have the marriage age set to 12 with parental consent. Just a few hundred years ago you had people marrying 12-14 years of age. Many kings and queens that ruled in Europe married at earlier ages. To compare modern times and consider it the peak of human morality is a fallacy on itsown. Not to mention some of the historic figures in the bible and their age gaps. For example, in the catholic tradition I believe Joseph was 90 when he married Mary. You can see the points made by the Shiekh in the video for more information.\n\n4. Finally, NOT A SINGLE ENEMY of the prophet ever used Aisha's age as an attack on the prophet's character. There is not a single hadith of any christian, or jew, or atheist that hated the prophet saying anything about his wife as an attack on his character. No such hadiths. This has only been brought up in modern times with \"woke\" people thinking their time is the most moral one.This just shows that it was not seen as morally wrong and was an accepted part of society in the past even by the worst critics of Islam back then.", "Religion is giving me big anxiety and I don't know what to doHey everyone. First of all, before anyone thinks that, I'm absolutely not an ex-muslim or anything like that.

Thanks!\n\nI wanna emphasize on my state of faith. I'm a \"muslim\":  I try to follow it as much as possible, I never ate pork, I never drank, never smoked, always ate halal, respect and adore my parents, try to be kind to everyone, try being generous, do Ramadan, Eid, plan to not have sex before any marriage etc, marry with a muslim woman. I also pray but in an incomplete state (I'm still learning but my prayers are definitely not correct as of now, but I still try, hopefully God doesn't punish me). I haven't read Quran fully yet, I've started reading it recently. But it's kinda weird, I fear that God exists and I'd get punished in the afterlife but at the same time I'm not 100% sure about if God exists (Gosh, this hurts a lot to even write about it...) it's so hard :(. I don't even know if this is considered as shirk/atheism. For example, when I pray, I don't feel that connection between me and God... :(\n\nDeath really scares me too, what if I die tomorrow suddenly? In this awful faith state I'm in (not doing fully correct prayers even though I try, not sure if fully believing in religion) I may just go to Hell after that...\n\nI also avoid going on any religion debates now because my faith is so fragile, sites like Twitter made me really doubt my religion even more, really wished I didn't go there\n\nAlso I can't enjoy anything in life because I always think about \"what if this is Haram?\" -> this happens with EVERYTHING, when I hang out with my friends which are mostly non-muslim, when I listen to music, when I watch anime (since human drawings are sometimes considered haram), when I watch TV shows, when I play video games, when I laugh with friends about stupid stuff etc etc.. or even when I think about \"do I like this person?\" I just end up thinking in religious methods: \"Are they muslims? Did they do bad stuff in their lives? Is it haram to appreciate them since it could be considered liking non-muslim persons\". Or also I think: \"Why am I doing this when I could just be praying?\" except I think this 24/7\n\nAlso I can't enjoy anything aswell because I feel like nothing matters in this world... I play video games and then I think \"what do I gain from doing this? In the end I'll be dead anyway and I just lose time, the time that brings us closer to death every single second I'm playing\" and then I end up doing literally nothing, thinking about life and why we exist. I also feel bad that most of the people I like (for example actors, especially the ones that do good deeds or the mentioned non-muslim friends) will probably end up in hell since they're not muslims\n\nFurthermore, I'm a med student and it makes me not able to do a few things. For example, I often end up at the hospital doing important shifts where I'm alone (alone as in the only person that has the same grade as me) so that ends up making me not able to do Friday prayer because I'm not allowed to leave and we often don't have enough lunch time especially if I'm alone (sometimes I don't have lunch time because there's a lot of patients to see). Always missing the friday prayer makes me super anxious because I didn't know it was considered a major sin to miss, I live kinda far from the mosque (10-15km and I don't have a car) too. I'm scared of going to hell because of it even though I try to do a lot of good things in my life and follow the religion as much as possible... At the same time I'm scared of eternity (both for Paradise/Hell) -> what if you get \"bored\" in paradise, the concept of eternity scares me, what if you wish dying in Paradise too? Except this is inescapable so there's no solution and I end up depressed even more\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do, if some of you would like to answer to the questions I have tried raising here, I'll gladly appreciate it.\n\nThank you all my brothers...", "Anxiety and islamI have started having a massive problem with anxiety,stress and fatigue and was wondering if anyone else had this same problem?  I feel overwhelming anxiety whenever I don't do something directly related to islam. I used to love learning about science, but now when I want to  learn about science I feel incredibly guilt over the fact that im not learning something about islam. I am starting to become more and more distant from my friends due to this. I also have a feeling that nearly everything is haram - all of the hobbies I used to use to mitigate stress(music, video-games, movies, etc.) seem to all be haram, besides science. But I've mentioned the issue with science above. And besides, science didn't even bring me rest before, since I had to put quite a bit of effort into it. So, I was wondering, how do other muslims deal with stress? Any tips? Also, no dhikr, salat and reading the Qur'an I dont think would help since they excite me, only leading to even more fatigue afterwards. Naps and walks dont really work either anymore - can't sleep if im anxious, and if I walk while anxious I can get even mroe anxious due to not doing something islamic(for example, not picking up trash where I see it, or doing some other good deed).", "Let's talk about halal entertainment for introvertsWell there's no arguing here. Starting from music to tv series to stand up comedy to video games, they're all haram. Because they have elements that are haram. Reading anything that is against the guidelines of our religion is haram so poof goes reading anything with romance in it. Comics and painting pictures of living creatures is haram. It seems that halal forms of entertainment are very limited nowadays. Watching sports, playing sports, hanging put with your friends, reading books that don't include romance are halal. But as an introvert, I don't like sports or going out much and I do not like to socialize that much and I really don't like sports or reading so it seems halal entertainment is difficult for me to find. It seems that I have to force myself to find joy in something I have never found joy in and I have to force myself to be someone I never was and I feel like I can't be.", "Just wonderingIs gambling in video games haram ?

This year is different for many of us due to the circumstances of the world and the epidemic we are experiencing, but the optimist, which as Muslims we must strive to be, will see this as an *opportunity.* \n\n***\"When the month of Ramadan arrives, the doors of mercy are opened.\"*** \\- Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him\n\nRamadan is a month of true reflection on oneself, striving to become better people through worship and good deeds. I think we should really focus on striving hard this Ramadan to regain a footing on our iman, that which our relationships are based upon - if we are in a lull, I want us to get out of it, if we are on a high, I want us to maintain it. I want us to get excited and eager to please Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, this Ramadan. In Surat Al-Waqi\\`ah, Allah says that there are three kinds of people, those of the left hand, those of the right hand, and those who are *as-Sabiqoon*, but who are those? The ones that are the forerunners, the ones that are nearest to Allah. I don't want us to settle for the right hand, I know we can always do better, I know we can be of *as-Sabiqoon.*\n\nRamadan is also, and primarily, the month of the Qur'an! For those that do not know, Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed in. As Muslims today, and ever since the time of the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, we stand in prayer every night during *taraweeh* for hours after we finish our fast and recite the Qur'an, 1/30th of it every night for 30 nights, so by the end of the month we have recited the entire Qur'an!\n\nMost of you will remember that I did a daily Ramadan post last year citing the *Juz* (section or part) of the Qur'an that is recited that day, and I will be doing the same thing this year, insha'Allah, along with the relevant context and short summary of the *Juz*.\n\n**For a brief overview of rulings regarding fasting and other things during Ramadan, please** [**click here**](https://www.islamicity.org/5331/islamic-legal-rules-of-fasting/)**.**\n\n**For a Ramadan planner to help you organize your month, please** [**click here**](https://www.islamicreliefcanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IR-RamadanAgenda.pdf)**.**\n\nFor our non-Muslim brothers and sisters, please feel welcome to join in on the fasting, setting yourself some goals to work on this month (many people try things like no smoking, less or no video games, etc.), and just being in the spirit of things - and keep asking questions! I would also advise everyone here in /r/Islam to avoid the debates and arguments, spend time in just learning and being good to one another.\n\nSome reminders:\n\n**Ramadan**\n\nAbu Hurayra, may God be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said:\n\n>\"When the month of Ramadan comes, the Gates of Jannah are thrown open and the Gates of Jahannam are shut, and the devils are put behind bars.\"\n\n* Bukhari & Muslim\n\n**Reward**\n\nAbu Ayuob, may God be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said:\n\n>Whosoever fasts in Ramadan and then follows it with fasting six days of Shawwal, it is as if he fasted for a year.\n\n* Muslim, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nisa'i and Ibn Majah\n\n**Moral Training & Self Discipline**\n\nAbu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said:\n\n>Fasting is a shield; so when one of you is fasting he should neither indulge in obscene language nor should he raise his voice in anger. If someone attacks him or insults him, let him say: \"I am fasting!\"\n\n* Muslim\n\n**Forgiveness**\n\nAbu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said:\n\n>Whoever observes fasts during the month of Ramadan out of sincere faith, and hoping to attain Allah's rewards, then all his past sins will be forgiven.\n\n* Bukhari & Muslim\n\n**Protection from Hellfire**\n\nAbu Sa\\`id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\n>Anyone who fasts for one day for Allah's sake, Allah will keep his face away from the Hellfire for (a distance covered by a journey of) seventy years.\n\n* Bukhari & Muslim\n\n**Good Deeds during Ramadan**\n\nIbn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said:\n\n>\"The Prophet was the most generous of all people, and he used to become more generous in Ramadan when Gabriel met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night during Ramadan to revise the Qur'an with him. Allah's Messenger then used to be more generous than the fast wind.\"\n\n* Bukhari\n\nMay Allah grant us all a beneficial Ramadan in which we come closer to Him!

What does this mean exactly? Is it not allowed to do things just for the sake of recreation even if its not productive?\n\nHere\u2019s an example of a confusing answer: https://islam.stackexchange.com/questions/52213/is-killing-people-in-video-games-haram", "Contemplating leaving Christianity for IslamHello there,\n\nFor the past few months, I've been contemplating leaving Christianity for Islam.\n\nI'm 14 year old Male  and my closest friends  are  mostly Muslims.

We play on the same sports team. We are basically brothers. The topic of religion have been brought up a lot the past year.They taught the basics of Islam and I really enjoyed learning the religion.  They've persuade  me into considering converting to islam.\n\nIslam is a really beautiful religion.A lot of people think I'm way too young to be making this huge change, but I really want to.

Up until now merely 20 assessments were public.\n\nThe cover-up begins even before any assessment, as the military decides for itself whether any allegation of civilian casualties are \u201ccredible.\u201d As the\u00a0report shows\u00a0a plethora of clear murders are covered up as \u201cnoncredible\u201d:\n\n**JAN. 6, 2017 \u2014 MOSUL, IRAQ**\n\n**The military deemed this case noncredible, finding that the target was an ISIS site and that no civilians had been harmed. But interviews with survivors, as well as video footage and photos, showed that 16 civilians were killed.**\n\nAfter this stage, even if they have to admit an allegation is \u201ccredible,\u201d the nonchalant way they brush off the murders they commit is nothing less than cruel:\n\n**Yet despite this unrelenting toll, the military\u2019s system for examining civilian casualties rarely functions as a tool to teach or assess blame.**\n\n**Not only do the records contain no findings of wrongdoing or disciplinary action, but in only one instance is there a \u201cpossible violation\u201d of the rules of engagement. That stemmed from a breach in the procedure for identifying a target. Full investigations were recommended in fewer than 12 percent of the credible cases.**\n\n**In many cases, the command that approved a strike was responsible for examining it, too. And those examinations were often based on incorrect or incomplete evidence. Military officials interviewed survivors or witnesses in only two cases. Civilian-casualty reports were regularly dismissed because video showed no bodies in the rubble, yet the footage was often too brief to make a true determination.**\n\nFurther, even when a case is deemed credible, and an investigation is conducted, the actual death toll is deliberately covered up for a \u201cmore palatable\u201d amount of murder, which itself could only be a concept in their amoral democracy:\n\n**Roughly 37 percent of the allegations deemed credible stemmed from prior ground investigations by journalists or nongovernmental organizations; in those cases, the acknowledged death tolls roughly tracked outside reporting. But in the other cases, The Times\u2019s own reporting found that the civilian toll was nearly double that acknowledged by the military. (That did not include ISIS fighters\u2019 wives and children, whose information was difficult to verify.)**\n\n**The documents identify children killed or injured in 27 percent of cases; in The Times\u2019s ground reporting it was 62 percent. In 40 percent of the sites visited, survivors had been left with significant disabilities, which were not tracked by the military.**\n\nThe cover up is not merely on the assessment level, but on the ground as well:\n\n**In an interview \u2014 speaking anonymously because of a nondisclosure agreement \u2014 an analyst who captures strike imagery said superior officers would often \u201ctell the cameras to look somewhere else\u201d because \u201cthey knew if they\u2019d just hit a bad target.\u201d**\n\nIn the end, the author of the report arrives at the conclusion that the military was never concerned with reducing the civilian death toll] and that the processes of assessment were only implemented as a \u201cpsychological veneer.\u201d But do the bloody-handed butchers of the US Armed Forces really need it? As the report writes:\n\n**In chat logs accompanying some assessments, soldiers can sound as if they are playing video games, in one case expressing glee over getting to fire in an area ostensibly \u201cpoppin\u201d with ISIS fighters \u2014 without spotting the children in their midst.**\n\nBeing the kind of person to sign up for service in the US Armed Forces, it is unsurprising for them to act like the base animals that they are. But then the question remains, why is the veneer of procedure actually there?\n\nThe answer is that the fundamental underpinning of democracy is appearance, not substance. Democracy, a system built fundamentally on the concept of compromise, has no place for truth or conviction. It, by design, empowers the kind of amoral sociopaths who are willing to do anything to achieve electoral success. So while they are unwilling to let go of the material gains of the endless wars, they know they can manage to keep the public outcry to a minimum through the smoke and mirrors of \u201cprocedure.\u201d\n\nThis is also the reason why the US government goes after whistle blowers with such ferocity even when there is a public outcry of support for those whistle blowers. Other bloody-handed Western democracies in turn readily give their support for prosecutions of truth tellers, as seen in the recent case of Assange and the UK.\n\nThe democratic, freedom-loving West, who ostensibly prides itself on allowing dissent and liberty, suddenly marches in lock step whenever their true nature is revealed.\n\nNever forget that the blood of these people is also on the hands of the traitors who praised the West and their crusades of democracy. To fall for the siren song of \u201chuman rights\u201d and \u201cdemocracy\u201d is to dishonour the memory of the martyred and the murdered.\n\n**\u201cWhat happened wasn\u2019t liberation.

Actually, it\u2019s not lately. It\u2019s been going on for probably more than 4 years. I never understood or knew what i did to deserve this, but it\u2019s gotten to a point where it\u2019s been so bad i can\u2019t even handle it. Where do i even start. In school, i don\u2019t even know why but i\u2019m always the dumb one of out of probably more than 200 people i\u2019m friends friends with at school. Recently, midterm marks have come in and i have 70s in all my classes (except maybe 3 or 4 classes which i have more than 80 or 90 and 2 classes in which i have 60s in), which makes my grade to a below 80 average. All my friends have 80s and 90s in all their classes, some of them even 100, and they all have honor roll or scholarships and all that. It\u2019s just so frustrating why i have to be the odd one out. And my social life is horrible too. My parents for probably more than 8 YEARS at this point, have never allowed me to go to my friends house, hang out with them or play anything with them. I\u2019m not even allowed to play video games with any of them, even though I have a ps4. Everyday after school after school, i have to come home right away or my mom would get extremely worried and cry and all that stuff. My dad would always pick me up from school and I can't walk back home with my friends or do stuff on my own. And it\u2019s not like i hate and i\u2019m ungrateful, i\u2019m clearly appreciative of all this. But it\u2019s getting way out of control. Now, my friends barely talk with me, text me, play with me or do anything with me. And everytime i try to talk with them and try to fit in, they would just stop talking, act like they listened and continue with their talk. Even when it comes to group work, i never get picked to be in a group or team with them because to all of them, i\u2019m seen as that weird and annoying kid. Had my parents not been way too overprotective, i would have had better social and communication skills. But because i had to endure that since maybe grade 4 or 5 and now i\u2019m in grade 10, i was forced to be alone and lonely my whole life. I never told them i acted the way i am because of my past situations because i know they would make fun of me or not care at all. I\u2019ve not been doing good in sports either. I play competitive soccer and have been for over 7 years. But ever since the start of 2021, i have been gradually declining in my performance. In 2019, i had 20 goals and was one of the top players on my team. But ever since the start of last year, i\u2019ve only scored ONCE. ONE goal. Yeah. And one of my friends, who plays hockey, is the top player on his team and has been for a long time, and he has 10 goals in just the last 2 months, while i have none. In fact, i barely get enough playing time because my coach does not see me as a good enough player anymore and he wants the better players on the team to have the most minutes. My friend has many mvps, and a lot of medals, while i have a most improved player award of all things and only 2 medals to show for it. And in basketball, i got rejected and cut from the school team (2 schools actually) 6 TIMES. And a bunch of my friends either advance to the next tryout or make the team. This actually happened only 3 months ago as well. All this that i just mentioned, this has been going on for almost 6 years now. And i don\u2019t know why out of the hundreds or probably thousands of people i know, and the millions and billions of people on this planet, i have to go through all that, i have to live a life full of constant stress, nonstop bad luck and loneliness, while everyone i know is living a stress free, happy and blessed life. I\u2019ve never been at a lower point in my life. All this feels like i\u2019m the only one out of the almost 8 billion people on earth that\u2019s going through this, that this is a nonstop nightmare i have to deal, have dealt with and probably will have to for a while to come. I never had the courage to tell anyone about what i\u2019m going through because no one cares. This world we live in, no one gives a damn. I can\u2019t even handle it anymore, it\u2019s gotten way too much. I have no idea what i did wrong, what i did to someone, did i hurt someone, am i cursed, does Allah hate me, am i the most unluckiest person ever, am i doing something wrong, i don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just an innocent 15 year old kid trying to live a good and happy life, not one full of stress and constant anxiety. It\u2019s become unbearable at this point. I\u2019m still not allowed to hang out with friends or play games with them, i\u2019m still being treated like a kid, i\u2019m still not getting good grades, i\u2019m still not getting good minutes in soccer, i\u2019m still getting rejected by so many chances to go good things for others, i\u2019m still not being let go of this crazy, stressful, hurtful, painful and emotional battle of a nightmare. And i feel like if i\u2019m talking about this or thinking about this more, all of this will just keep continuing. When will this stop, why is this happening and what did i do wrong?

I struggle and I fear what I could become,  I know that I am becoming a better person,  I still have anxiety but I'm improving on yet , I used to be lazy but I've become for disaplined , I lost all faith In islam and Allah,  but I have found my way back\n\n\nI have left out alot about my childhood and other things that happened(my mother is alive idk why but I feel I need to say) and the friendship was litteraly me becoming my father , but yet if it wasn't for her I wouldn't be where I am she has taught me alot and was the best years of my life,  and she was the main reason I became more Islamic, yet all she got was me acting horrible. I feel as I will be punished for what I have caused her , and I feel as I should.  I truly regret what I have done", "How Islam saved me from Sex Addiction (it is valid for any addiction by the way)Hello,\n\nBefore I start, I didn't know which flair I must assign for this post but my apology if it is not suited.\n\nI have long been afraid to share this due to many factors but I felt like it is time to share my story about the sex addiction I had.\n\nCurrently, I'm recovering and everything is going well (Alhamdulillah).\n\nYou are probably guessing that one of the factors that held me to not talk about this to someone was about our religion. Sex is taboo in general.\n\nIt has been 6 months now I'm on this journey of going towards a \"normal life\". And it has been 1 month that I see some changes in my behavior overall. I cannot hide that I have flashes but they are not strong as a few months ago.\n\nThe courage I have writing those words is coming from the number of times I struggled to get over the addiction. Indeed, my journey began 6 months ago when I finally decided to go to a psychologist. And it was a different kind of psychologist using a combination of the wisdom in Islam and psychology. I'm Muslim and talking about sex to a fellow Muslim, especially if it is a Woman, is not well seen. Well, my psychologist was a woman and I must say that I was so afraid to talk about it. But I had to if I wanted to feel well, save my future and my relationship.\n\nI had a very difficult childhood; I had a lack of love from both parents, I was rejected oftentimes due to my appearance in school (even got bullied) and I got sexually abused. I won't go into details about my family but you see the kind of family I was coming from. Now, the structure of my family has completely changed and I thank God for that.\n\nI first got addicted to video games playing several hours a day. And I even failed some years in schools due to that. Sex addiction started in parallel. I must say that I wouldn't have a sex addiction if some people wouldn't initiate me to that and use my vulnerability. Therefore, it all began within my family when my uncle showed me his wife's private area on his phone. I was very young at that time. I must also say that they might have done other things earlier before this event but I may not remember. Slowly, I began to watch pornography and wanted to have intercourse at a very young age. But I managed to hide those urges deep inside me until my teenagehood. There, I was living a normal life until my family met some, good in appearance but filthy in their blood, families that we believed they were like family to us. Unfortunately, I got abused by young women and some boys from them. That triggered the feelings I was hiding from my childhood and it finally burst out. Again, I still managed to handle the situation and not act out. And thankfully we cut our contact with them. Arrived in my 20s, there, I finally saw the consequences of all the things they have done to me, and the feelings I was hiding deep inside me were now making it to the surface. That intensified with the entering the university. I was alone, and I got free time to party, drink, and smoke. I needed to be away from my family and my feelings. I used substances as a way of escaping my past. I struggled with relationships, even get abused there too. Until I meet a girl that understood me. But it wasn't easy for both of us because she had also psychological issues. She finally decided that I need to go to a psychologist for my issue or she would leave me. At that time we had a 1-year-old relationship which was the longest relationship I got. Therefore, I had to go and see one. I felt deep down I wasn't well.\n\nI went and I told my psychologist everything from the beginning. That I couldn't understand why I had this addiction, that I was angry all the time, that sometimes I felt like a psychopath having not healthy thoughts. I put on the table what I had in my heart. And it lasted for 3 months. During these three months, I struggled so much. I discovered that my sex addiction wasn't a simple addiction but a canvas on top of multiple little issues that occurred during my childhood and teenagehood. That's where my religion saved me. Or, supported me morally. Indeed, as a childhood, I had the feeling to go towards Islam and the Qur'an. I learned by myself the prayers and the rituals. I always felt there was something strong out there, like energy that guides me. I was always sensitive to that sensation. You see the paradox there? I was between two worlds: a world of faith and a world of chaos.\n\nDuring those months I prayed so much with the combination of psychology exercises that she gave me. I wanted to heal and to have a decent life like other people and have a healthy relationship (btw, I have a long-distance relationship). In Islam, if you do the effort, look for alternatives and solutions, God will open up the doors and give you the necessary energy to achieve what you are seeking. And most importantly, we have the belief in \"everything in this world is a **test**\". But one thing was important: Faith. I know, it may sound utopian or too religiously focused but I experienced it. Whatever your faith, believe, you cannot deny what your heart is telling. So I believed in God first, then, in myself and what my heart was saying.\n\nI was well until the new year hit (2021). From the new year, for two months, I lived what can be called \"the decisive moment when my destiny was to be defined\". I went back to my old habits of sex addiction. It was worse than before. The trigger was due to some event with my girlfriend who had serious psychological issues that also hurt me badly, even got traumatized. One choice and my life were going to turn either for the good or the bad. I thought that God tested me when I went to the psychologist for three months. We thought with my psychologist that everything was going well and that I was going towards a well-grounded recovery. And decided to meet every two-three weeks instead of each week. Beginning of 2021, for two months, I was emotionally destroyed; I had finally met the sad reality of this world. I thought that everything I had acquired during my sessions with my psychologist was now all lost; all my prayers, all my hopes, my life goals, my future. I had lost my point of reference. Therefore, I had decided to let it go. I had given up. Let go of the person I loved, let go of my dreams of becoming a doctor, and I turned to commit sins. That is when God intervened. I wanted to commit sins, intentionally. I was fed up with being patient. I wanted simplicity. All the conditions were there to carry out these sins: women, alcohol,\u2026. I was determined to do it! I had even started to sketch out a new plan for my future: I wanted to just finish my current studies (social sciences) and get married soon. For weeks, I was in this state. In this state, I couldn't think clearly. My goal was simple: simplicity. Everything was in front of me, I could extend my arm to take it. And that's what I did. I took refuge in this world's pleasure. I wanted to taste the pleasures of this world now and not in the future. I was exhausted. Indeed, I was running from pain.\n\nThen something strange happened to me. I can't tell you how that urge to commit sins was at that time, but I was like obsessed. But God prevented me from doing so. I don't know how but every time I wanted to grab that sin, I felt like my hand was slapped. No matter what I was doing, I couldn't grab the pleasure when they were a few feet away from me. There was like an invisible barrier between me and the sins. I could feel this barrier, an invisible force holding me back. Deep down inside I also prayed that God would guide me and forgave me in advance if I did any of these sins. Indeed, life put me on my knees and I had nothing left but to put my head on the ground and ask for forgiveness every time I was going towards a sin.\n\nI recently learned that the body would not be sick if you have a healthy soul. Therefore, instead of focusing on the addiction itself, I focused on my soul and how I can heal it. Believe me, it is nothing to do with religion but with you and only you. Islam is not a religion but a way of life. And believe me, if you want to heal your soul, you must connect to it with a higher entity (whatever you want to name it). Simply find a way towards that light and surely you'll find your place in this world and who you truly are.\n\nWhat helped me was the sciences of this world to understand my body and God to understand my soul. This combination showed me its effectiveness and as a future doctor, I'm now believing that the body should not be separated from the soul.\n\nSo, that was my story. It takes patience, consistency, and perseverance to get over any addiction. Thank you for reading. And especially thank you for letting me share with you something that I have in my heart. I hope that I shed some light of hopes on my brothers' and sisters' life who are too ashamed to talk about their personal issues about that, or, at least, I allowed you to discover a new perspective on this subject matter.\n\nHold strong to Allah (SWT) and believe that He is always next to you.\n\nAll my prayers to the Ummah and may Allah protect us from the world's filthiness.

I think we should really focus on striving hard this Ramadan to regain a footing on our iman, that which our relationships are based upon - if we are in a lull, I want us to get out of it, if we are on a high, I want us to maintain it. I want us to get excited and eager to please Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, this Ramadan. In Surat Al-Waqi\\`ah, Allah says that there are three kinds of people, those of the left hand, those of the right hand, and those who are *as-Sabiqoon*, but who are those? The ones that are the forerunners, the ones that are nearest to Allah. I don't want us to settle for the right hand, I know we can always do better, I know we can be of *as-Sabiqoon.*\n\nRamadan is also, and primarily, the month of the Qur'an! For those that do not know, Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed in. As Muslims today, and ever since the time of the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, we stand in prayer every night during *taraweeh* for hours after we finish our fast and recite the Qur'an, 1/30th of it every night for 30 nights, so by the end of the month we have recited the entire Qur'an!\n\nMost of you will remember that I did a daily Ramadan post last year citing the *Juz* (section or part) of the Qur'an that is recited that day, and I will be doing the same thing this year, insha'Allah, along with the relevant context and short summary of the *Juz*.\n\n**For a brief overview of rulings regarding fasting and other things during Ramadan, please** [**click here**](https://www.islamicity.org/5331/islamic-legal-rules-of-fasting/)**.**\n\n**For a Ramadan planner to help you organize your month, please** [**click here**](https://islamicreliefcanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IR-RamadanAgenda.pdf)**.**\n\nFor our non-Muslim brothers and sisters, please feel welcome to join in on the fasting, setting yourself some goals to work on this month (many people try things like no smoking, less or no video games, etc.), and just being in the spirit of things - and keep asking questions!

Here is *YAQEEN INSTITUTE* (an institute of scholars from various disciplines by the way) using drawings and graphic design to tell a story: [Our Muslim Youth are Hurting: Animation](https://youtu.be/SzeIPrp-WVA)\n\n\n\n************\n\n**Shk. Ahmad Kutty's on the general ruling regarding pics**\n\n> *It is not haram to draw such pictures for the purpose of education through illustration. The intent of the law prohibiting images was that in pagan times, it was a direct means and way to shirk (associating other beings with Allah). In other words, these things were only forbidden because they served as direct means and avenues to shirk. Therefore, if there is not even the remotest possibility of shirk, there is no reason to consider it as haram, especially if there are tangible benefits in drawing them...It is important to keep in mind that today drawing has become a very powerful medium of communication. For this reason, Muslims cannot simply afford to neglect this vital medium of communication; if they do, they only do so at their own peril...*\n\n(ed note: This echos what Yusuf alQaradawi once said: *\"We need diversity in fatawa, a person may impose restriction on himself, but can any modern state afford to do without these?\"*)\n\n*******\n**Shk. Faisal Mawlawi, Vice Chairman of the European Council for Fatwa & Research, on statues**\n\n> *Making, buying or possessing statues falls under the well-known principle of jurisprudence which reads: \u201cEverything is lawful unless there is an attribute turning it into an unlawful matter\u201d. If the statues are made to be worshipped, then buying, selling or possessing such would be one of the grave sins.  Making statues to imitate Allah\u2019s creatures is also a grave sin. However, such statues could be of a spiritless object, i.e. the sun, the moon \u2026 etc or of a lawful doll. Hence, some scholars said that the permissibility or otherwise of such statues depends on the intention of the one who makes them. Statues or flat drawings made to commemorate great men in a way that may lead to some kind of worship are prohibited; this is out of blocking the ways leading to evil; a rule unanimously agreed upon by scholars.*\n\n> *Statues and drawings which are neither worshipped nor revered are permissible, even if there is no legitimate need for them. Making such statues becomes commendable if there is a legitimate reason, i.e. children dolls are lawful according to the four schools of thought in Islam.\u201d*\n\n**********\n\n**Shk. Yusuf Qaradawi on the gradual edicts**\n\n\n> *...Probably in the early period of Islam the Prophet (pbuh) was very strict in prohibiting all pictures, as the Muslims had only recently come out of the state of polytheism and idol-worship, and were prone to sanctifying figures and statues. As the belief in the Oneness of Allah became deeply rooted in their hearts and minds, he allowed them two-dimensional figures, that is, drawings and prints....* \n\n*******\n\n**Prof. Muhammad Imarah on how the early Muslims understood this issue**\n\n\n> *The Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, followed this very direction which does not generalize the ruling. They destroyed and eliminated the idols of the Arabs. In the same time, they kept intact the statues that people did not worship in the countries in which Muslims entered. They did so in Egypt, Afghanistan, India and many other territories.*", "7 Tips for RamadanBismillah,\n\nI thought I'd share a few things that might be beneficial this Ramadan. Things that could be game changers for some, or reminders for others.\n\n**1)** What ever food you have for Suhhor and especially Iftar, don't complain and just eat, Allah(swt) chose it for you, even if you had to eat just bread. That patience by not complaining could very well be the excuse Allah(swt) makes for us on the day of judgement. \n\n**2)** Do not waste any food, even if it's a few grains of rice left on your plate, or the gravy coating our plate or the pot. The Prophet(saw)'s habit was to eat that gravy from the pot because of the baraqah, so just imagine the baraqah and how he(saw) was in Ramadan. We often like to tell non-muslims that part of fasting is realizing what the poor go through. Wasting food obviously shows that the one fasting has learnt nothing of the plight of the hungry, so lets not be of those whose fast has taught us little or nothing.  \n\n**3)** Plan on giving Sadaqah every day, even if it's just a $1 or even a few cents. Put it aside every day and give it when you can. The Prophet(saw) was even more generous in Ramadan and we know that Sadaqah extinguishes the anger of Allah(swt) like water extinguishes a fire. \n\n**4)** Fast from social media, just as we fast from food. The things we see and the things we read could possibly count as backbiting and destroy our fast. In addition, how can one lower their gaze when looking at non-Mahrams on social media especially with the types of clothes, or lack of clothes we see today. Fasting is for us to gain Taqwa, so if we still can't seem to stop visiting places we should avoid, what does it tell us about our fasts? \n\n**5)** This is very important. Just as we fast, so too do many in our family. Which means so do our mothers, fathers, sisters and wives. We have to ask ourselves if we're oppressing them by not alleviating their load in Ramadan. Help them as much as we can, clean, tidy, help cook, do the groceries, give them every opportunity to rest and read Quran. Look for ways to help them throughout the day and don't waste these opportunities. It could very well be through this help, that Allah(swt) accepts our Ramadah.\n\n**6)** Try not to waste time or pass time doing things of no benefit, like video games, or watching videos etc. I know it's tempting to see videos, pictures or recipes of food, or what we'd like to eat. At the very least, gradually cut down on the time spent with these things over the course of Ramadan, and in it's place increase a good deed like reading the Quran, dhikr, or helping others. My hope is we can show Allah(swt) that we tried to give up something for him through this gradual transition.\n\n**7)** Last, but definitely not the least. Actually, maybe it should be at the top but I'll leave it here in the hope it leaves a lasting impression on someone, Insha'Allah. I know this should be a no brainer, but seriously, how can we gain anything from a fast, in which we are missing our Salah? How can we go to sleep after suhoor and not perform Fajr thinking we're succeeding in our fast? We've actually failed, because if the purpose of fasting is Taqwa, where was the Taqwa to perform a major major deed in Islam? There was absolutely nothing considering missing Salah is a major sin as Hanafi Ullamah mention:\n\n>It is major sin to miss fardh salah. Though, it is severe sin to miss the salah but it does not make a man kafir. However, missing the salah (not offering) is the practice of kafir. That is why Hadith says: whoever leaves salah intentionally he committed kufr. [[Source]](https://islamqa.org/hanafi/darulifta-deoband/111029)\n\nIt's a major sin outside of Ramadan, just imagine how much worst it is for us, while Shaytan is chained, that we still can't perform our Salah in Ramadan? We can stay hungry and thirsty all day, but for 5 minutes, we can't perform our Salah? If we miss our Salah, we should look deep and ask, who are we really fasting for? That same Allah(swt) we claim to be fasting for, is the same Allah(swt) who has made Salah a fardh upon us.  Allah(Swt) save us from such a state, in which we intentionally leave our Salah.

However, we want to make sure that we're not choosing structures that might offend Muslims, especially if those structures have religious significance.\n\n1. We already have feedback that we should not directly replicate any Mosques, but would it be offensive if we built architecture in our video game that has onion domes or minarets? Should we stick with styles that are found in palaces? \n2. Would it be offensive if Players were exploring the inside and outside of Islamic architecture while looking for and solving puzzles?\n3. Are video games such as Assassin's Creed (city of [Damascus](https://assassinscreed.fandom.com/wiki/Damascus?file=Damascus-depth.jpg)) or [Prince of Persia](https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/846/189/260/fantasy-art-prince-of-persia-2008-wallpaper-preview.jpg), both with Islamic-style architecture, generally received positively, negatively, or neutrally? \n4.

Ameen!\n\nSincerely,\n\nh4qq", "Do we really care about Allah(swt) and Islam or do our actions show something else?Bismillah,\n\nOne of the most valued qualities in a human, is honesty and integrity. Meaning, when the individual says something, they mean it and their actions reflect it. For example, they say that they care about their health, and if you had to examine their life, you'll see that not only do they eat healthy, they also exercise regularly and stay away from what is harmful to their bodies. Observing their lives will show that their actions are consistent with their words. \n\nTo be fair, this is a quality that even non-Muslims exhibit and hold valuable. But we as Muslims are to be honest and be people of integrity because it's part of Islam, exemplified by the Prophet(saw). When we say something, we should exhibit the quality or action we claim of ourselves. The last thing we should be are hypocrites, who make claims about ourselves, but not live up to those claims and show the opposite.\n\nAs a result, if we make the claim that we are Muslim and value Allah(swt), then our lives should reflect this claim. If part of being a Muslim, especially one that values Allah(swt) is being punctual in our Salah, then this should be evident in our lives. If we claim the best book is the Quran, then we should treat it as the best book and value it like it's the best book. We should be constantly reading it and telling people about what we've read.\n\nWhat are we saying about ourselves and do we really reflect what we say. These are the questions we'll be asked on the day of judgement. We'll claim that we did things for Allah(swt), or that Allah(swt) was the most important, yet on that day, either our actions will prove our claims, or proofs and our body parts will speak up against us. That we said one thing, but really it was just a fa\u00e7ade. \n\nOur worldly actions will be held against us, considering they are proof of our ability when things matter to us. We couldn't spend 5 minutes (25 minutes cumulative) for Salah yet we spent an hour at the gym, playing sport or video games? When it comes to Islam, we're lax with hardly any effort, content with stagnation or even receding, making excuses saying \"oh we're not all there yet\". But when it comes to work, we're punctual and abide by all the rules, improve ourselves and be amongst the best constantly, looking for that promotion. Shouldn't we atleast be just as diligent in our actions towards Islam and not less, vastly less?\n\nI really could go on, and on example after example. Really what are we telling our Allah(swt) and what are we saying about ourselves? Are we really honest in our claims, or are we just paying lip service, because our actions prove our priorities are else where.", "Removing images with faces in my home- To what extent?Assalamualaikum. \n\nI have been making an effort to remove pictures and images from my home. \nI have been reading different opinions and some are asking to remove all traces of faces from my home so does that mean,\n\nStuffed animals I won from a fair?\nDvd, books, and video game covers?\nSmall lego people I find in my sets? \nCereal boxes that may have an athlete or a person on them? \n\nAm I to remove all traces of depictions of people from my home in this manner?", "Please help with marital issues. Need Islamic advice.This is a throwaway. I am facing marital problems and am in dire need of outside perspectives. I have posted this to r/relationships before but the only advice I got was \"DIVORCE!!\". I would like to get some advice that is preferably taken from an Islamic perspective. This is a LONG POST, so buckle up.\n\nSo I am 22F and an orthodox Muslim (meaning I practice Islam as it is stated in the Quran and do not believe in nationalism, culture or traditions.)\n\nSome backstory: I am from the UK and 2 years ago I started attending a pretty prestigious uni studying history. I got involved in Islamic societies and that is where I met my future husband, Ibrahim 28, who was doing a PhD. He was very nerdy and quiet, and a little chubby and the type who was too shy to speak to girls, but he was my type. He was the quintessential patriarch as men are supposed to be in Islam. After 5 months of being in the same groups and clubs he asked me out and I fell for him pretty quickly. He immediately expressed the desire to wed so as per practice told my parents who also fell for him too. It was honestly the best time of my life, he was someone who I could spend the whole day with and not get bored, besides having similar interests such as video games and anime, we most importantly clicked on Islamic views. He was ethnically Turkish but a devout Muslim who agreed with my views of not caring.\n\nNow, a couple of things about his family. His father left his mother and went back to Turkey leaving the kids; I was initially told this was because he was an abusive man, turns out the reason was different. Now my Mother in Law had always (seemed) to like me, though she was a bit disappointed that I was not Turkish. I am south-Asian but do not remotely look like it, pale skin ,light eyes, I take after my mother; both my parents are Bengali. That was her only grievance, she found nothing else against me but my race, I was iffed but whatever. Ibrahim's older brother 33 Amir, unmarried, was very unsettling. He looked at me in a way no brother in law should look at a sister in law. It was pretty gross, but he lived in Nottingham and we in London so it was not a big deal I thought.\n\nWe got married in late 2018, and it was beautiful. I should also state Ibrahim was head over heels for me. That is not to say that I did not love him, I adored him; But he acted like I was some goddess, this is because 1. God has given me a very pretty face so I never lacked male attention in my life and in his words, \" picked him out of everyone\". 2. I reciprocate his feeling as despite his age no girl had ever paid attention to him as he isn't the beauty standard, not that I cared. This seemed to INFURIATE his mother, she never fully said it out loud to me because I don't take BS from anybody and she knew that. But small things like washing my white summer dress with coloreds and then claimed that it was an accident she ruined it. Or the time I caught at night her putting FISTFULS OF SALT in the lamb chops I left to marinade in the fridge to grill the next day and then claiming she was sleepwalking? I caught her red-handed with her eyes open and singing.\n\nI remember having an argument with Amir. We went to Epping forest and I couldn't walk around for even a second without him taking pics with his flash camera and got pissed. His mom told me that I was rude and he was just taking pics. I looked at the camera roll and I kid you not 77 pics out 83 were of me just minding my own business. I told him it was Islamically inappropriate for him to have so many pics of me. He apologized and deleted them. That was the first time I confronted him about his behavior. Now one thing to say about my husband as that besides being super smart, he was never good at handling social issues, so when it came to things about his mom and his brother, he just apologized on their behalf.\n\nMid-March I found out I was carrying twins, a boy, and a girl. My husband was through the roof and I had never seen a man cry so much. Everything was well and the babies were healthy and we were happy, right? wrong. About 3 months into my pregnancy Ibrahim got cold towards me. I felt awful because I thought I did something to upset him. I probed him pointlessly, and he just got more distant and distant, he did not talk to me, we got less and less intimate and I was miserable.\n\nThen it happened. About 7 months into my pregnancy, he came up to me and slapped me. I was just so utterly shocked I felt like my soul had left my body. I started crying uncontrollably, as he kept yelling at me. All I heard was whore this, bitch that, cheating and the rest, he punched a couple of times too. Honestly, I fully blacked out even though I was still awake. Until then you could have held a gun to my head and I still would not have believed you if you told me this man has a capacity to hit me or swear at me, I was just so lost.\n\nAll I knew that I was told to pack my things and leave immediately. He was sobbing too. I left like a robot on autopilot, just confused as to what was going on. I called my dad and he picked me up. Hw got into a massive argument with Ibrahim and then he left. And then he looked at me and told me \"Don't worry about anything\" and this is why I love my father. We drove home and I locked myself in my old bedroom and cried for what seemed like 2 weeks, only ate bcs I was pregnant. I felt physically hollow, such emptiness apparently is brought on by the body to \"numb\" you from excessive sadness. Honestly, it felt more like my husband had died, and in a sense, he did to me anyway. After the sorrow had passed it was intense hatred. So much so I started shaking every time I thought of him. I am not even sure how it is possible to hate someone like that to the point where you erase their existence from your mind. But it happened, in a matter of 2 months I forgot what he looked like, more like deleted him. I looked at a picture of him and it was blurry, not the picture itself but the way my eyes saw the picture. Apparently that's what PTSD will do to you, I was diagnosed a week later. At this point divorce was obviously going to happen, my parents supported me in this fully.\n\nThroughout he sent multiple messages, calling my children \"whore babies\" and that they are definitely not his. I was just so numb to this but it was useful evidence in court in case he tried to claim custody, which he likely would have because the kids are his. But anyway, I gave birth (C-section) in November and my babies were perfectly healthy and absolutely adorable, like cherubs. He was not told of the birth but found out through the grapevine. Now he was still a Muslim so he wanted to annul the Nika in an Islamic court and be emancipated from the kids \"because they were not his\". This required a DNA test and I was grinning because I wanted to his face when those results were readout. We met in January 2020, frist time since the incident, and he avoided looking at me. I just wanted to get the nikha annulled so I really did not care about him in the slightest. His fat mom came and his brother, who smiled at me.\n\nThe imams began reading out the proceedings and rulings and I stated that I did not want to go through the 3-month trial thingy as he had beaten me. They regrettably agreed and then...the results. Throughout the whole proceedings, he was fully stoic and looking at the ceiling. Now I bought my kids with me because it was required but they were asleep in their carriage next to me. Something about my kids is that while my daughter is a mix my son is the spitting image of Ibrahim, same curly black hair, same face, same shorter than average index finger. The imams had played with my babies before the proceedings and they could tell too, which is why they were vehemently against me not doing the trial. The results were read aloud and obviously they are his.\n\nWell that was the only time he looked directly at me like a deer caught in headlights. I gave him a half-smile and quickly looked away. He looked at the imams with a gaping mouth but said nothing. Then I see one of the sisters handing some tissues to him, I was like seriously? Cry outside. His mother started crying and asking if she could hold her grandkids. I surprised myself but I walked out of that mess like a badass, feeling satisfied.\n\nNow this was at a pretty big mosque in London, if you live here you probably already know. But I was in the third-floor breastfeeding. A sister comes in and tells me the head imam wants to talk to me. He asked if I could let him see the kids. I was like are you serious? I have a soft spot for good religious leaders plus he was a sweet old man and he begged me for it, so I said reluctantly yes provided his mom or bro were not there. I walk into the Imams office and see Ibrahim sitting there, looked like he been wailing with snot everywhere. I stood at a distance from him when he tried to hug me. Then a sister came in and handed him my daughter who is a more social baby, my son is more introverted. He held her, hugged her, kneeled and just started wailing, LOUDLY. I had never been so uncomfortable like I was watching a soap opera on the TV. The imam had hoped that I would regain some of my feelings for him after that shit show, I was like lol not happening. My son did not want to be held by him and I said \"you are stranger to him, stay away from him, besides you called him a devil so why do you care anyway\". That was spiteful I know but just didn't care.\n\nHe kept saying sorry this sorry that bla bla. Apologized to my babies, \"Daddy's sorry\" .I just got up and left, the divorce was now confirmed, or so I thought. I felt sick to my stomach that he had the audacity to act like this after everything he did. A week in and the head Imam calls me and said that I need to come because \"not everything is clear\". I went alone this time. Saw the fucker waiting in an office with a glass wall. The imam sat me down facing him, I looked at him like I would look at any stranger. He began his shitshow of apologies and crying and I asked if my time was to be wasted. The imams told him to talk about \"it\".\n\nSo according to him, this is why he acted the way he did: About a week later we announced my pregnancy, his mother showed him a slew of texts that she told him was from me to other men, like how lazy do you have to be. That upset him but he did not believe her. Then, and this was all told to me by the way I never saw any evidence, his brother showed him a video of me making out with someone. I do not know how or why or when but I just nodded with a large grin. His brother is a computer engineer he might have photoshopped shit, but honestly, I don't care.\n\nThat's the day he kicked me out. After he wasted 1 hour of my time telling me this all the while pathetically crying, I just looked at the Imam and \"What do you want me to do with this info?\". He said I should give him another chance, I just laughed and said he was an idiot for believing anything my ex said. He just begged me but I went home. I should also say that by this time I had already met someone. Like I said I do not have trouble attracting men, and he was a 29-year-old divorcee, Ahmed,  with the cutest 3-year-old daughter who both got really close to my kids. He moved in as a tenant in one of my dad\u2019s houses and asked me out, and was excited when I told him I had kids because he did too, since then he has been a defacto dad for my twins . We were planning to get married in April but, Covid. I knew I had a pretty good case against him if he ever tried to sue for custody so I was not worried. I thought yep, that's it all done My family is complete.\n\nApparently no. The imams in the mosque got really invested in the case and they contacted my favorite Imam, think someone like Mufti Menk who was touring at the time. They asked him to talk to me as apparently it was a very difficult case and were not sure about giving me a divorce. I went just cause I wanted to meet him. He basically told me that while my divorce was fully grantable, it would be immoral for me to leave a man who was fully remorseful. I just played along and said suure. So next month my ex and I met in the Imam\u2019s office, frist thing he told is that he cut his mom and brother. He also told me the reason his dad left his mom was because she was psychotic and he believed his mom had changed. He looked like death, super skinny which was soo weird because I am used to seeing him chubby. His under eyes were so deep he looked like a panda, he was starting to resemble a corpse. \n\nSo I let him know my conditions if he ever wanted to get back which were mainly designed to be so outlandish he would back out: \n\n1. He would get a vasectomy. There is no way I want another kid with him.\n2. He would disown his family \n3. He would write off any and every bit of property he owned to me. \n4. I would NEVER make the him kids father on paper but he could raise them alongside me\n5. He would pay me \u00a320,000 before anything . \n6. I told him that I would still after all this likely marry my boyfriend, which up until then he did not know I had. \n\nAnd the most ridiculous one of all: \u201cCut off 3 fingers from the hand you hit me with\u201d. I near damn laughed when I said it and I could see the people in the room get angry. Except him who just mumbled a pathetic \u201cyes I will\u201d. I was told off by the Imams but reminded them that I couldn\u2019t care less and that I only came cause of them, I have nothing to gain out of being with Ibrahim. \n\nNow in the coming months he actually fulfilled almost everyone of them. He got a vasectomy the next day. Put in the processes to get himself emancipated from his mom. And was arranging the rest. \n\nMe on the other hand just ignored everything and kept on going on dates with my bf and let our new family bond with each other. His little girl never had a mom, so she clung to me so sweetly it was hard not to fall with her. Until one day 1 am the cops knock on my door. \n\nHE. CUT. HIS. FUCKING. FINGERS. I was freaking wailing when they told I had been an accessory to a suicide. Everyone was panicked. My babies had to see their mom in handcuffs thank god they won\u2019t remember. \n\nI was rushed to the police station and spent an hour there and then went to the hospital when my lawyer called their bluff. Ibrahim had tried to cut a finger but passed out due to pain; His roommate found him in the new place he moved to, and he told the paramedics I TOLD HIM TO DO IT. I did not say anything to him but he was super high on whatever drugs they gave him and delirious. \n\nMy mom has since softened on him and said that maybe I should get back with him. My dad on the other hand says if he is psychotic enough to do this then he can harm the kids. I\u2019m not so sure about that. \n\n1 day after he got himself patched up, my mom invited him to our house without telling me. I was furious but did not want to upset the kids. He bought soo many toys and other stuff for me (dresses I think, i do not know as I did not open them) and handed me some legal paperwork regarding the thing I said about the property. I thought OMG he lost it, he crazy crazy. I was mostly quiet and just answered a bunch of questions with a yes or a no.\n\nEx: How are you?\n\nMe: Going a date in an hour so you should be leaving soon.\n\nEx: Are you taking the kids?\n\nMe: Yeah. Our kids like to play together.\n\nEx: Listen, I wanted to ask when it was ok when to talk to you privately.\n\nMe: Why private? You\u2019re gonna try and cut my fingers?\n\nEx: Please\n\nMe: No can do. Whatever you had to say you could have told me in front of the Imams. Also take these freaking papers back. I don\u2019t need your money to take of MY kids, and I WILL NOT NEED IT IN THE FUTURE. \n\nEx: Sorry\u2026\n\nMe: Look you clearly love the kids and you actually did a vasectomy, so I thought that maybe we could have shared custody. I go ahead and marry, you do what you want, and you can still raise them with me. \n\nEx: You are still...going to marry him? Are you serious with that?\n\nMe: Here is picture of me in my wedding dress, I ordered it last week. My frist one was white so this time I went with black. Hopefully the second marriage doesn\u2019t end up as shitty as the frist one. \n\nEx: I did everything. I just want to go back the way it was.\n\nMe: I have PTSD because of you. I have terrors of being beaten by you repeatedly. Believe it or not I hate you so much looking at you makes me sick. I don\u2019t say that as a metaphor, I just have this endless amount of hate for you, it scares me too. \n\nEx: We can work on it. I\u2019ll do anything please I\u2019m sorry. \n\nAnd from there he just started his usual routine of crying. I\u2019m so over it. This was 2 weeks ago, since then he comes over every day to spend time with the kids. My dad hates him and tells him off all the time and punched him once, but he does nothing. My boyfriend knows he is bonding with the kids and he is not happy. \n\nI think I am convinced that he regrets everything. He is psychotic but he showed it. I am between a rock and a hard place. This is why I do not know what to do and wanted advice. \n\nI have a couple of options. \n\n1. Blow off my boyfriend who I love who knows the pain of divorce and the pain of betrayal as he has experienced it himself and likely will not do it to me. And be in a mediocre loveless marriage with a man whose guts I hate, a marriage with no intimacy because I am not letting him touch me. And just put all my attention and focus into my kids. \n2. Blow Ibrahim off and live a long and loving marriage with my bf and my new daughter completely cutting him off. I lose nothing here.\n3. Move to Australia and just blow both of them off. Unlikely. \n\nSo, ladies if you were in my shoes what would do?\n\nAlso gentlemen, what do you think?\n\nAlso huge thanks for reading this mammoth post. But remember that although this sounds like a soap opera, It\u2019s my life, so please keep comments civil. \n\nPeace be on you.", "Is it a sin to play dungeon and dragonsThe board game not the video game", "Why is Pork Haram?Hello\n\nI am a convert. I know that pork is haram and when I ask other muslims they tell me because they eat their own feces? Which is true for almost all other mammals. It is a practice to enrich their gut microflora. Elephants, cows, pigs, bears even chickens, they all eat their own/family members poo.\n\nSo I tought a reasoning would be why monkey is haram. Because they are too intelligent. Pigs are the third most intelligent animal after humans. They are smarter than dogs. Few years ago they did a test on them and made these guys play video games. \n\nWhat is your tought on the haramness of pork? Perhaps they are too wasteful for farming?", "I'm scared of making haram moneySo basically I found a way to make money from reselling video game accounts - in my country because of currency value being extremely low compared to USD I can make money with selling game accounts, but there is a problem, the company that owns the game doesn't allow account selling, however I feel like that's only because they don't want to deal with support tickets being full of \"Someone stole my accounts please get it back\" I don't think a company worth more than 15 Billion dollars cars if I make like 50K from selling their accounts \n\nfor your information here are so details \n\nThe game is free to play (but you can pay for in game power and upgrades) \n\nI'm selling accounts from people that need money or don't want to play anymore Im not hacking or stealing anything\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI must say I'm always paranoid of making haram money, I love my life Im in a situation in my life that im finally happy after years of problems so im not gonna even let a slight chance of this ruin it for me \n\nso i would appreciate it if you helped me out \n\nbtw my family mostly makes money buy reselling stuff in my country which is somewhat illegal so my money might already be haram so idk", "We pirated/cracked shows/apps halal?Im good at Photoshop, but its cost is a little high with the monthly subscription, i like to watch anime and used to use websites like anime dao or 9anime to watch it, but i don't know where they get the animes from, and it might be pirated i have no idea, same with movies and tv shows, most of what i have watched are pirated, most of video games have cracked versions, which are free, so is all the websites I've started above, so is me watching these animes or playing those games halal?? And is me using a cracked Photoshop for personal use or business use halal?? I hope someone replies with evidence supporting their claims", "How do I go about becoming part of my boyfriend's Muslim family when I myself am not religious?So some background: I (21 female) and my bf (23 male), I'll refer to him as Z, have been dating for a little over a year now. Z was born in Pakistan but moved to America when he was 6. His family is very very religious, however he doesn't really consider himself to be religious (I'd say we're both agnostic), but his family doesn't know this. They also don't know that he has a girlfriend, and they want him to have an arranged marriage. \n\nWe both recently graduated from college and so our relationship has been getting more serious. My family is very open and he's been a part of it pretty much since we first started dating. He hangs out with my dad a lot (they both play video games together) and he visits my grandma with me all the time. He stays at my house on a regular basis. But his mom wants him home all the time, and I think her expectations for his future are that he'll stay there with her indefinitely. Z's dad died when he was still in Pakistan so his mom and grandma I think expect him to be their caretaker. I want to be a part of their family but Z thinks they will essentially disown him if they find out he's 1) no longer with their faith and 2) dating an American without their permission... I'm worried that if I meet them they will forever think of me as the person who took their son away, that I'm the one who shook his faith (I'm not btw, he had already decided Islam wasn't for him when we met), and that Z won't be able to be part of his own family because of it. He has an uncle that had the same thing happen, where he started dating an American and his family cut him off completely, so the concern isn't unfounded. \n\nI don't want that to happen though, and I want his family to be part of our life. I want them to understand that I'm open to exploring and understanding their culture, but I don't know the first thing about Islam and I don't know where to start. Me and Z want to start a family of our own someday, and I'd love for his mom and grandma to be a part of our kids lives. I also don't want them to think that just because Z moves out that we'd be abandoning them. We've talked about how I should be introduced to them, but I feel like I don't know anything about their culture and I'm looking for advice on how to go about it and maybe some different perspectives on how Z's family might interpret the situation. His grandma only speaks Urdu, so I've thought about learning some Urdu myself before I met them so I can talk to her. I've also thought about learning some dishes to cook, since I'm not very well versed in the kitchen and I know that's a valuable asset when they look for a wife for Z. I don't know what dishes are part of their cuisine, so if there's any recommendations for what to learn to cook I'd appreciate that too! I don't know if I should dress a certain way either. Really I'm looking to get any advice you have to offer or pieces of Islam culture I should know about or look into before I meet Z's family. I don't think they will be happy to meet me either way, but if there's anything I can do to make them feel more comfortable with the situation I want to do it! I want them to see me as someone who's trying to join their family and understand their culture, not someone who's trying to take their son away... \n\nTLDR: \nMy boyfriend's family is very religious and they don't know he has a girlfriend. He wants me to meet them soon and I'm trying to get some advice and insight so that they may be more likely to welcome me as part of the family, despite not being religious myself. \n\nEdit: \nIt seems as though this isn't really the correct community for this post. I apologize for conflating Desi and Islam, I'll do better to inform myself.", "Clauses in entertainment sites which makes reference to man made laws kufr or not?Salaam. My question is sort of in two parts but they are connected and I need help understanding something. I have been reading Islamqa and Islamweb viewpoints on weather the ruler who rules according to man made law  due to his desire is considered to be a kafir or not. The scholars have stated that the one who governs a law other then Allah  in terms of legislation and not in personal situations is considered to have committed major kufr and the scholars usually have said \"this is because the ruler preferred these laws over Allah and thinks these laws are better then Allahs laws\" but what about if it was out of pure desire, as in the ruler knows Allahs laws is the best and should be used yet does not rule by Sharia because of his own whims and desires? \n\nThe second part of the question is related to the title and concerns a lot of Muslims especially the youth who play video games or use other entertainment websites or when ever you download a video game from a website or some other form of entertainment apps for example discord or you use Netflix, YouTube, Facebook etc, 99% of the time it has an agreement which states things like in any breach in the agreement or dispute you would be taken to court or you have to follow the law of the countries like United States or any other man made law court of a country. You obviously have to tick the \"I consent to the terms and conditions of the agreement\" in order to download the game or view the service being provided, does this come under referring to Judgement other then Allah. I have seen similar questions to this on Islamqa and Islamweb and an overall conclusion is that if the programme is required then one may use it for example Microsoft word or google chrome, these software are pretty much essential so one can sign the agreement as \"Allah wants to make things easy for us\" but what about programmes which one does not need such as these movie sites or video game companies and other forms of entertainment, pretty much millions of Muslim Youths have signed these agreements and I doubt this takes every one out of the fold of Islam but still we are pretty much consenting for the cases to be judged by man made laws although the intention of the Muslim is just to play games or view the entertainment but still is signing such a condition regarded as kufr?", "3D art, videogame, and IslamWe know that nowadays, video games and 3D renders are so close in imitating real life.

Is it haram to play this challenge ?", "I'm a terrible muslim, I'm starting to lose faith in Islam and hate religion need advice (long rant)I'm 15 years old, sunni, and from a very religious family, I also wear the hijab, which was my own choice. I've started hating religion, I'm getting sick of it. I get really pissed whenever I have to pray, or read quran because stakhfuralla I just don't see the point of it. I get that it's supposed to help in life and make us feel at peace but if anything it's religion that's making me feel not at peace. It's stressing me tf out. There are so many things religion prevents me from doing. I wore the hijab happy and proud, I still am, but sometimes I miss having my hair show, I miss wearing short sleeved t shirts. I hate religion class, when before I used to love it and get full marks on everything in it. There's this boy who likes me at school, he's my friend, I don't like him back but would not mind being in a relationship since he's so nice and we basically have the same personality. But no I can't do that because religion. It would be nice if religion allowed relationships, but without kissing or sex, then I wouldn't feel this way. And I'm not that into romantic stuff so I don't want sex or kissing or any of that just want to be able to like text him and go to each other's houses and stuff like friends, but in a relationship. It's weird I know. But can't even treat him like a friend, can't call or text just cause he's a boy and because religion doesn't allow. I even asked my mom if we could have an imessage group that she and his mom had access to so we could text, \\(imessage so we don't get each other's numbers we could have made the contact with our emails\\) and they'd be able to make sure we don't do anything inappropriate. Her reply? No because she doesn't want me to be friends with a boy. I'm sick of this. Religion prevents me from having a friend of the opposite sex, I think it's bs. Can I not even have a friend? What if someone loses all their friends, and the only friend left is the other gender friend? \"Oh you can't text cause they're not the same gender blah blah\" As long as we don't do anything inappropriate then I don't see why not. \\(He's also muslim\\) Well, if I can't stay in contact through texting and all, I'm giving us a way to stay in touch that doesn't use any apps or discord or any of that. He's too good of a friend. and I won't use discord cause mom knows about it and will find out. Then there's the whole homophobic and transphobic issue. Like religion never said you had to be homophobic, and I'm not, but I have to pretend to be just so my family won't lose their shit. Like okay you can have your opinion but please stop trash talking the lgbt community okay? Sexuality doesn't affect who someone is as a person, so I wish they'd stop. They do treat lgbt people like anyone else, but say not to get close to them, or you'll be pro\\-gay. If I ever have kids I'm totally letting them have friends of the other gender. I'll let them decide wether or not they want to be pro or anti gay cause that's their opinion and they should have a right to it. I'll let them text as long as the kid's parents allow them to, and they'll be able to come over. Teenagers can do a bunch of shit behind their parents' back without the parent ever finding out. Mom should be glad I'm a good daughter with a sense of guilt, because I could totally have a chat, on my laptop \\(cause mom checks my phone to make sure I don't text any boys\\) and could do so much, but I don't just because religion. If I ever have kids, I'll let them hang out, and if my kid says they have a crush on the opposite sex friend, I'll see if the kid is good and if they are I'll let them get married once they grow up. Religion is too strict. There's some other stuff I thought but won't say it cause questioning that stuff will put me in hell, I can only think of it cause islam doesn't punish you on your thoughts. I know if I tell my mom she's gonna say \"oh it's because of the internet and video games and you see people in relationships you hear people trash talking religion blah blah blah\" um no this is my own opinion, and the only reason I still pray and all that is because I don't want to make my parents sad. the prayer isn't even a prayer it's just me doing moves and saying quran but it's not a prayer cause I don't feel anything, and I'm not into the prayer. I want to ask God for help, but really I wouldn't have these thoughts if religion let me have basic friendship with the other gender, or if my parents weren't constantly nagging me to read quran and getting pissed if I accidentaly miss a prayer. Parents do not do this cause it's having the opposite effect on me. Honestly, I've almost completely given up on religion, and at this point I don't believe in religion anymore. The things I actually believe in are that there is a god, and heaven and hell, but I don't believe in the other stuff. I think religion should judge you on how you treat people and the things around you. Not on stupid shit like who you want as friends or what clothes you wear. I do agree that girls should dress modestly, but I think Hijab should be optional. Also, why tf do people who act on their transgender/homosexual feelings by getting in a relationship with the same gender or being the opposite gender go to hell? Like come on I think that's stupid. People should be allowed to be happy in life, you want them to be depressed just because they can't be homosexual or transgender? Honestly, I think that's unfair. It doesn't affect who they are as a person, so who gives a shit? Not me, that's who. And yep I'm probably going to hell for saying all this but I'm sick of keeping this my secret. I've been having these thoughts for 3 years and I always feel guilty for them. I'd convert to my own religion, believing in allah, but only one mandatory prayer before you sleep, and you get judged on your actions, how you treat people, not all the other stupid stuff. But I can't, my family believes that I will be a great muslim, and I don't want to make them sad or disappointed. Then there's the whole thing about all the non believers going to hell. I've been in this personal conflict for 3 years now, and I'm just done. I need a break from religion. But no, that's not allowed either. I want to tell my mom, but she's gonna be depressed, I just know it. And I'm enough of a disappointment with my failing grades, I don't need to disappoint them from another area. ", "[Ramadan] - Welcome! / Rules of Fasting / ReminderAssalamu `alaykum wa rahmatulLahi wa barakatuh,\n\nMay the peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you all.\n\nAll praises and thanks is due to God, we have reached the month of Ramadan once again, and I hope we are all super excited, insha'Allah. \n\nRamadan is a month of true reflection on oneself, striving to become better people through worship and good deeds. I think we should really focus on striving hard this Ramadan to regain a footing on our iman, that which our relationships are based upon - if we are in a lull, I want us to get out of it, if we are on a high, I want us to maintain it. I want us to get excited and eager to please Allah, subhanu wa ta'ala, this Ramadan. In Surat Al-Waqi`ah, Allah says that there are three kinds of people, those of the left hand, those of the right hand, and those who are *as-Sabiqoon*, but who are those? The ones that are the forerunners, the ones that are nearest to Allah. I don't want us to settle for the right hand, I know we can always do better, I know we can be of *as-Sabiqoon.*  \n\nRamadan is also, and primarily, the month of the Qur'an! For those that do not know, Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed in. As Muslims today, and ever since the time of the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, we stand in prayer every night during *taraweeh* for hours after we finish our fast and recite the Qur'an, 1/30th of it every night for 30 nights, so by the end of the month we have recited the entire Qur'an!\n\nMost of you will remember that I did a daily Ramadan post last year citing the *Juz* (section or part) of the Qur'an that is recited that day, and I will be doing the same thing this year, insha'Allah, along with the relevant context and short summary of the *Juz*. \n\nFor a brief overview of rulings regarding fasting and other things during Ramadan, please [click here](https://raleighmasjid.org/imam/fiqh-ramadan.html). \n\nFor a more in depth and scholarly work on relevant rulings, please [click here](https://raleighmasjid.org/imam/fiqh-ramadan.html). \n\nFor our non-Muslim brothers and sisters, please feel welcome to join in on the fasting, setting yourself some goals to work on this month (many people try things like no smoking, less or no video games, etc.), and just being in the spirit of things - and keep asking questions! I would also advise everyone here in /r/Islam to avoid the debates and arguments, spend time in just learning and being good to one another. \n\nSome reminders: \n\n**Ramadan**\n\nAbu Hurayra, may God be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said: \n\n>\"When the month of Ramadhan comes, the Gates of Jannah are thrown open and the Gates of Jahannam are shut, and the devils are put behind bars.\"\n\n- Bukhari & Muslim\n\n**Reward**\n\nAbu Ayuob, may God be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said: \n\n>Whosoever fasts in Ramadan and then follows it with fasting six days of Shawwal, it is as if he fasted for a year.\n\n- Muslim, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nisa'i and Ibn Majah\n\n**Moral Training & Self Discipline**\n\nAbu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said: \n\n>Fasting is a shield; so when one of you is fasting he should neither indulge in obscene language nor should he raise his voice in anger. If someone attacks him or insults him, let him say: \"I am fasting!\"\n\n- Muslim\n\n**Forgiveness**\n\nAbu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said: \n\n>Whoever observes fasts during the month of Ramadan out of sincere faith, and hoping to attain Allah's rewards, then all his past sins will be forgiven. \n\n- Bukhari & Muslim\n\n**Protection from Hellfire**\n\nAbu Sa`id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\n>Anyone who fasts for one day for Allah's sake, Allah will keep his face away from the Hellfire for (a distance covered by a journey of) seventy years.\n\n- Bukhari & Muslim\n\n**Good Deeds during Ramadan**\n\nIbn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said: \n\n>\"The Prophet was the most generous of all people, and he used to become more generous in Ramadan when Gabriel met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night during Ramadan to revise the Qur'an with him. Allah's Messenger then used to be more generous than the fast wind.\"\n\n- Bukhari\n\nMay Allah grant us all a beneficial Ramadan in which we come closer to Him! Ameen!\n\nSincerely,\n\nh4qq", "I am completely exhaustedSalam aleykum brothers and sisters. \n\nI don't know if someone remembers my other posts, but it all started with that https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/9eptfh/explaining_a_brother_that_zina_is_haram/, then that https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/ahyjcr/i_need_help_with_my_situation_brothers_parents/ and lastly it was that: https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/aol72a/i_just_need_help_i_think/.\n\nI can confidently say that I (or rather, \"we all\") are at a new low. I am feeling an exhaustion that I never felt before and my thoughts went from 50% negative all day to 70% negative. I don't think that I am healthy anymore.\n\nTo vent a bit and think about everything again: Me and my family live in Europe since about 18 years. My father is here since more than 30 years, me, my siblings (twin brother and younger brother) and my mother came here about 18 years ago. Me and my twin brother are 21, our younger brother is 5 years younger. We are all from an Muslim country in Africa. \n\nMy parents did the mistake that they raise us as if we are in their home country, not in Europe. So we didn't attend any Islamic classes or Arabic classes and just went to normal European schools, also we didn't have Arab TV at home and we only flew to see our relatives about 3 times in these 18 years. All this is crashing on us now since a few months. My twin brother, despite having read the Quran in Ramadan and praying his prayers, is in a haram relationship since nearly 5 months now. He is doing bad at his last year at school and all he is doing is being on his phone in his free time (besides the bit of studying he does for school which apparently isn't enough). My younger brother is doing the same. Doing bad at school and watching youtube videos or being on his phone all the time. When all of this started and I saw this pattern (about 5 years ago), I warned my parents multiple times that this is going to end very very bad, but they said that I also played video games and so on in my free time so this will get better eventually. Well, it didn't as I expected ...\n\n\nWhat is happening now is that my twin brother doesn't talk about anything, and goes to see his girlfriend every single damn weekend, sometimes even staying ther over night. My mind is exploding, and my parents are saying that we have to solve this in a relaxed manner, but in my opinion, they are making too small of an effort. My father is mentally ill because of all what is happening (another things are going bad too, which you can read about in my other posts if you want, may Allah reward you for that), thus, he isn't working since a few months. My mother seems to be overwhelmed by everything, and because she isn't tech savvy, she really doesn't know how our generation thinks and acts, making her not knowing how to make anything better.\n\n\nMyself: Allah blessed me with being different than the other same aged people I guess. I never followed any of the new fades (social media, brand clothing, having girlfriends, going to partys etc. etc.). But my weakness is that I am very emotional. I can't stand seeing my brother lie to my parents, or him not taking responsibility for anything. I am literally doing my stuff (university, studying, working part-time) + all the formal stuff that my father could be doing (may Allah grant him health and energy) + the things my mother needs help with (may Allah reward her for her effort in everything). All my brother has to do is to look after himself, finish his school and atleast try to be a good muslim (because my parents, despite the mistakes they made, still are good Muslim and were raised well, they were just a bit too spoiled I guess). And in both things he is failing and acting like having a gf is normal and that he isn't doing anything bad. \n\n\nI really don't know what to do or what to say or even what to think anymore. I am exhausted. Really really exhausted. Never would I have thought that I can become like that. I didn't workout in months, I am unconcentrated in my work, I am tired, even my eyes look dead. I'm tearing up again.\n\nPlease, any help would be appreciated. Really anything that could help me I will take. I can't continue living in this chaos anymore, I won't fucntion properly if it continues like that.\n\n\nJazakallah khair to all who read this.

He is now almost 18 and i am sad bc he changed so much. He spends most of his time in his room blasting music in his ears while he is gaming. He doesn\u2019t pray anymore, he is rude to me and my my mom. His room is messy, he doesn\u2019t care for his school (he still attends), he doesn\u2019t have passion for anything but gaming and sometimes working out in his room alone.

I do pray as in like ask Allah SWT for forgivness,for health and say prayers like Bismillah ir-rahman ir-rahim, Allahu Akbar,  *l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101 ll\u0101h.*\n\nBut I don't do Sujud as of now, I will do it in the future.  I know that is obligation for Muslims and there shouldn't be no excuse, but problem is: no one taught me ( parents never taught me to do it) and right now I don't have will to do it because of personal problems like I am still in college/university even though I am 25.. I started going to college on age 19, then I have never had GF.. all those hurt me mentally but I am still strong, I feel because Allah SWT is giving me strength and I am grateful for that. But, I promised that I will do Sujud( if the God lets it be that way) once I finish college/University,once this gets of my back( I hope I finish it next year).\n\nSome madhabbs say that if Muslim doesn't do Sujud, that makes him non-Muslim, is that true? I disagree with that because I know and feel in my heart that I am Muslim and that I pray to Allah SWT.\n\nNow, my question is; once I do Sujud in upcoming years, can I do it like 3 prayers a day, then after 6 months 6 and after a year all 5? Because I feel if I do all 5 at once and I am not familiar with them I won't do it from heart but memory which won't count..\n\nNow my friend who is doing all 5 prayers everyday I asked him if he couldn't do it on the strict times he said he does it once he can( because he works and he goes out for example) and I said: I read that that doesn't count only on strict times, he said it counts but less, is that true?\n\nI do fast but not entire month which is bad, but same above because of those things. But I will start as of this year to slowly expand it with heart. Like 10 days this year, 20 days next year and full month 2022.\n\nAs of Almsgiving and Pilgrimage IIRC those are if you're wealthy enough which I am not currently, once I finish my college I will do Pilgrimage maybe once I am 40 or 50. As of Almsgiving, I am not too familiar to this but I do give some money even now to people who need it who need operations or something and I do from heart because I feel sorry for them.\n\nNow onto other things about haraam and what I have done.\n\n1. It was 2018 and it was Ramadan and I was playing Fortnite ( I didn't fast that day) and I felt very awful but one guy have killed me in that shitty game( that I stopped playing like 1 year ago, thank Allah SWT) I got so mad that I said F God several times. I felt really awful and asked for Forgivness and even now I felt sorry and awful for saying that. But, Allah SWT did punish me because I am still in college/university which I deserved it. ( I did also curse God back when I played games and some one is making me super angry which I also repented it.)\n2. I made sick South Park level joke about Qur'an which also happened in 2018( which was the worst year for me) and even my friends told me that was too much and I did repent it( same with Shitnite stuff), I felt really sorry and I asked Allah SWT for Forgiveness even now I felt sorry( which I believe Allah punished me since I am still in college which I deserved it)\n\nI feel these are only two big sins that I have done that I am aware of: making sick joke about Qur'an and swearing on God because someone made me angry or video games( which is why I understood why online vs video games are haraam because of this but I don't think they're haraam if someone like Ninja plays this who can contain the anger and not do this stuff, stupidity that I did, but for me because of anger issue that came from things I wrote: no GF, no money, didn't finish college) . I don't remember if I cursed on God in 2019( maybe once I did which I felt sorry) which is good because I am changing , becoming better person and better Muslim which I am grateful.\n\nNow there are other things that I have done but which I think they're sins but maybe they're not. One is but I don't think it's that big because of story behind.\n\nThat thing is: Back in 2016/2017 when LeafyisHere was dominant on YT he created shitty \"insult\" KYS aka kill yourself. I never used as joke but I did use it as insult but hear my story:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was and I still am at some degree power-scaler and movie lover. Power-scaler is a person who per say scales who has stronger power in fictional worlds like Goku vs Vegeta and movie lover is pretty explanatory.\n\nSo that would be implied that I had many many debates in my 5 years when I debated people on who would be stronger than who, I also hated Pewdiepie and I debated Bros about him that he sucks, I also debated about Youtubers that they don't deserve much money and doctors get way less. Anyway... during those debates it's not easy to not insult people which I HAVE NEVER DONE IN FIRST PLACE. My motto is have nice debate and never start a insult firsts. Maybe someday I did start first but it stays on that level.\n\n90% people insult me first and we go and back forth and someone I told them to kill themselves, like \"Kill yoruself\". But immediately after that or 5-10 min after that I say sorry, it was out of place, childish I am sorry about that. I think that's a sin, but not big one because they don't actually do it because I don't think suicidal person would even debate who is stronger Goku or Vegeta let alone insult me first, but I apologized after that to everyone I believe and I regretted what I was saying. But I am not regretting when people told me to kill myself and I said; you first ;). Because they told me first.\n\nI remember one person( I think we debated about something IDK what) I told her/him, \" kys\" and he/she said \"Stranger told me to kms well I am going to now\". I immediately said I am sorry it was bad of me etc. I don't remember if that person responded to me. But I feel that was liek sarcasm like \" someone on internet told me to KMS wow, I am gonna do it\" and that person beforehand insulted me thus I was angry to tell him/her to KYS.After 2016/2017 I never told anyone to kys except in November 2019 I told one guy to KYS on Pokemon video because he was responding to me about how Pokemon Sword and Shield Pokemon suck and I was angry because many idiots hate on new Pokemon( I am Pokemon fan) but after that I apologized to him.\n\nI have anger issues and trust issues. Several weeks ago I tried to see how all those people I said KYS how they do , but since I have over 10,000 comments it couldn't load( comment history) I tried and Allah SWT knows and saw that. I just hope all those people are OK.\n\nAnother thing that I think it's haraam but not that big IMO is online piracy. I am not that wealthy and I am movie fanatic and I like video games. But I don't have that much money so I can buy movies which cost too much for my country I am not gonna lie. So what I do? I pirate them and video games. That same person who pray 5 times also pirates movies and games and I asked him if that's haraam he said it was but he said \" If you're Bill Gates, you can buy them\" meaning we're not wealthy enough to buy it, which I agree. I personally believe that's haraam but it's man-made thing and it's not like stealing a food( which is bigger haraam), I never stole anything except online piracy which like I said I have no choice, this is 21st century where technology is everywhere. You can't live without internet and entertainment per say. Video games and movies are everywhere and there are like 100 movies coming each year. How can you pay if you're not \"Bill Gates\" most of these movies and there are tons of movies.\n\nI said that once I start working I will pay for some/most of stuff like games because games but for movies: I am sorry I will try and buy as much as possible but pirate if I must. And piracy in my country is not forbidden like in Germany it is, my friend who prays lives in Germany and once he came to our country he pirated as much and returned to Germany.\n\nNow, there are other things that some people on NET consider haraam but IDK about them, it makes no sense IMO\n\nlike Masturbation is haraam, since when? I masturbate, everyone does( including Muslims), how is that haraam?\n\nOnly explanation is that masturbation can lead to doing evil acts( which I never did, like rape or killing) ( I understand that MB is haraam if you're married and you're MB and you have wife, I understand that)\n\nSex before marriage( I understand that but what if it's condom involved what if GF and BF love soo much?)\n\nMusic is haraam( since when?) I am listening to Breaking Benjamin, Starset, so that's haraam?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMovies and video games are haraam( since when?) These are all entertainment. Like I said it's 21st century movies and games are things \" we can't live without\". Surely, if you start doing that in these movies or games like worship a devil ( Tevbe ja Rabbi) which I and many other Muslims DON'T do when watch/play those like horror games or movies it's just entertainment.\n\nMaybe it's haraam for weak-minded or children that could be easily influenced. I watched Conjuring and nothing, good scared, good jumpscared and that's it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand many other haraams that are there like ( don't look at women at certain way, like she's hot, what I am gonna watch men? Lol), don't kiss and hug GF which is why? That's love expression.  What else men must have beard and don't shave beard which I do because I get itchy. Dating is haraam in Islam( since when?) etc etc. \n\n( BTW haraams like alcohol, pig's meat theft, murder, not respecting your parents etcs are haraams that make sense and that are actual haraams, but haraams like don't kiss your GF, don't look at women certain way, don't game, don't watch movies don't make any sense... it makes sense to children and weak-minded people, I agree with that but with all Muslims; it's a no IMO).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for long post.", "Hadiths and Ay\u0101t on Eating Light?Assalamu Alaikum,\n\nI imagine this will sound absurd but I am dead serious in my question. \n\nI am having a recurring issue after Iftar where I stay up to work on school work or catch myself playing video games after Taraweeh, but I also end up eating a lot. I mean A LOT. Alhamdulilah, I haven\u2019t stopped praying Taraweeh or reading Qur\u2019an or anything of the sort, but I am a bit unhappy with how much I am overeating. \n\nI wanted to ask for ay\u0101t hadith regarding eating Iftar and after fasting, or other relevant ayahs and Hadith on overeating. \n\nJazakAllahu Khairun!", "I feel like the deeper i get into Islam, the more i start questioning everything i\u2019ve ever done in my entire life.Assalamualaikum. I\u2019m 16, so I apologise if my way of writing doesn\u2019t seem very respectful or formal, or anything else. This is how I usually speak. \n\nHonestly speaking, I\u2019m not Muslim because I chose Islam, I\u2019m Muslim because I was born into a Muslim family. Though, I DO believe in Islam since I think only Islam makes sense out of all the religions that I\u2019ve(briefly) researched. I just think that the idea of needing to fear Allah is the right way to go, he is our creator after all. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that I identify as a Muslim, but I really didn\u2019t make the decision in my heart to choose Islam, if that makes sense. For example, I try my best to fulfill all the compulsory duties, like fasting and praying, and I understand the intended meanings behind them, but I usually do them just because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been taught.\n\nAnyway, getting to the point(like what the title says). A few days ago, I was listening to some music that I liked. Then, I was suddenly reminded of the phrase \u201cfood is music for the soul.\u201d It got me thinking if there is any reason for music to be bad , so I searched up on Youtube to hear out some reasons why music is particularly bad for you in Islam, only to find out that music as a whole is haram since it distracts you from Allah swt. There was a hadith mentioning how all image creators will go to Hell. Well it made sense, so I was just reflecting on it for a while. It got me to wonder if one of my biggest hobbies, drawing(mostly human figures and anime characters, and only for the intent of entertainment time-killing) was haram or not. Apparently, that\u2019s haram as well since it challenges Allah\u2019s swt ability to create life. Also, by the logic of that information, my profile picture/avatar is most likely haram as well. Furthermore, I did find out that image creating is  permissible for educational purposes and for mothers to create for her children, but neither am I a mother nor am I drawing for educational purposes, so these exceptions are irrelevant to me.\n\nIf everything that distracts you from Allah swt is haram, isn\u2019t almost everything people(Muslim or not) do in this modern world considered haram? Things like music, hanging out with friends, playing games, etc. I'm so confused on what I can or cannot do. One day, I'll find out you can do something but the next day, I find reasons why you can't. There's so many things that overlap and there is no right answer, unless directly mentioned by prophet Muhammad s.a.w. For example, selling something that distracts you from Allah swt to other people like phones are forbidden, but it's said that finding ways to earn money(as long as it's not too extreme like drugs) is permissible?\n\nRight before this, I had so many things I wanted to do throughout my life, especially career-wise. For example, starting a business, or being a content-creator(this doesn't just mean videos, in fact, what I mainly had in mind was publishing artworks, animations or music, just content in general.) However, now I feel like I have to rethink my whole life, think about what I want to do from now on, which is further narrowed by the many other things forbidden in Islam.\n\nSorry, this feels a lot more like a rant after reading it through. Regardless, I need someone to advice me on what to do and this is the only subreddit that I think can help.", "I have a recommendation for mosques around the worldBack in late 2017, I was somewhat religious, but I was very anti-social. I felt very disconnected from the Muslim community mostly because I had different interests (for example, I was legit the only Muslim kid I knew who liked baseball) and I had a more inward and nervous personality. I only hung around a tight group of friends, most whom weren't muslims. Then, one night, my friend came over and recruited me for something. It was called Young Muslims, an organization founded for Muslim communities. I was very reluctant, but I did. It was only a day, but it changed my life. I met so many new people, got accustomed to many new guys, some of which are close friends to this day (I also actually met other Muslim guys that liked baseball! lol).  From then on I've been a local to the group, I've opened up a lot more, in fact, I feel a little inverse in many ways to where I was before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what I have to recommend to many of you around the World. There are so many kids who don't feel included in their mosques and are disconnected. I was once one of those, and that's something I want to fix. We need to start creating Youth Groups, and I emphasize this strongly. I hear so much about how my generation is disconnected and bad, but there is a fix. You might be thinking, \"Well MrZTheKING, how?\" My answer is to start activities that the community will enjoy. For example, in my local mosque, we love sports. So we play basketball, football, soccer, we host NBA and Superbowl watch parties, and even go to Lakers and Angels games. Find stuff that the community likes whatever it is. It could be movies. Super heroes. Video games. Anything, include the community in it. Use unused space (or at least times when the Masjid is empty) in your Mosques and dedicated to the youth. Throwing a pool table, a playground or a court is a step but it isn't enough. Create the community and the friendships. The disconnection is a fight that we can win, I have faith in us.", "[Ramadan] - Welcome! / Rules of Fasting / ReminderAssalamu `alaykum wa rahmatulLahi wa barakatuh,\n\nMay the peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you all.\n\nAll praises and thanks is due to God, we have reached the month of Ramadan once again, and I hope we are all super excited, insha'Allah. \n\nRamadan is a month of true reflection on oneself, striving to become better people through worship and good deeds. I think we should really focus on striving hard this Ramadan to regain a footing on our iman, that which our relationships are based upon - if we are in a lull, I want us to get out of it, if we are on a high, I want us to maintain it. I want us to get excited and eager to please Allah, subhanu wa ta'ala, this Ramadan. In Surat Al-Waqi`ah, Allah says that there are three kinds of people, those of the left hand, those of the right hand, and those who are *as-Sabiqoon*, but who are those? The ones that are the forerunners, the ones that are nearest to Allah. I don't want us to settle for the right hand, I know we can always do better, I know we can be of *as-Sabiqoon.*  \n\nRamadan is also, and primarily, the month of the Qur'an! For those that do not know, Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed in. As Muslims today, and ever since the time of the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, we stand in prayer every night during *taraweeh* for hours after we finish our fast and recite the Qur'an, 1/30th of it every night for 30 nights, so by the end of the month we have recited the entire Qur'an!\n\nMost of you will remember that I did a daily Ramadan post last year citing the *Juz* (section or part) of the Qur'an that is recited that day, and I will be doing the same thing this year, insha'Allah, along with the relevant context and short summary of the *Juz*. \n\nFor our convenience, here is [a breakdown of how to do your fast and examples of what may or may not break your fast.](https://dusunnah.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/break-the-fast-chart.pdf)\n\nFor our non-Muslim brothers and sisters, please feel welcome to join in on the fasting, setting yourself some goals to work on this month (many people try things like no smoking, less or no video games, etc.), and just being in the spirit of things - and keep asking questions! I would also advise everyone here in /r/Islam to avoid the debates and arguments, spend time in just learning and being good to one another. \n\nSome reminders: \n\n**Ramadan**\n\nAbu Hurayra, may God be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said: \n\n>\"When the month of Ramadhan comes, the Gates of Jannah are thrown open and the Gates of Jahannam are shut, and the devils are put behind bars.\"\n\n- Bukhari & Muslim\n\n**Reward**\n\nAbu Ayuob, may God be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said: \n\n>Whosoever fasts in Ramadan and then follows it with fasting six days of Shawwal, it is as if he fasted for a year.\n\n- Muslim, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nisa'i and Ibn Majah\n\n**Moral Training & Self Discipline**\n\nAbu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said: \n\n>Fasting is a shield; so when one of you is fasting he should neither indulge in obscene language nor should he raise his voice in anger. If someone attacks him or insults him, let him say: \"I am fasting!\"\n\n- Muslim\n\n**Forgiveness**\n\nAbu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said: \n\n>Whoever observes fasts during the month of Ramadan out of sincere faith, and hoping to attain Allah's rewards, then all his past sins will be forgiven. \n\n- Bukhari & Muslim\n\n**Protection from Hellfire**\n\nAbu Sa`id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace and blessings be upon him, said:\n\n>Anyone who fasts for one day for Allah's sake, Allah will keep his face away from the Hellfire for (a distance covered by a journey of) seventy years.\n\n- Bukhari & Muslim\n\n**Good Deeds during Ramadan**\n\nIbn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, said: \n\n>\"The Prophet was the most generous of all people, and he used to become more generous in Ramadan when Gabriel met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night during Ramadan to revise the Qur'an with him. Allah's Messenger then used to be more generous than the fast wind.\"\n\n- Bukhari\n\nMay Allah grant us all a beneficial Ramadan in which we come closer to Him!

I chose discussion just to be safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo hadith, there were others but they basically repeat the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) as saying. Allah fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in. There would be no escape from it. The adultery of the eye is the lustful look and the adultery of the ears is listening to voluptuous (song or talk) and the adultery of the tongue is licentious speech and the adultery of the hand is the lustful grip (embrace) and the adultery of the feet is to walk (to the place) where he intends to commit adultery and the heart yearns and desires which he may or may not put into effect.  \n>  \n>Sahih Muslim, The Book of Destiny, 2658 a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Narrated Abu Musa:  \n>  \n>that the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: \"Every eye commits adultery, and when the woman uses perfume and she passes by a gathering, then she is like this and that.'\" Meaning an adulteress.  \n>  \n>Jami at-Tirmidhi, Chapter on Manners, Vol. 5, Book 41, Hadith 2786  \n>  \n>Grade: Hasan (Darussalam)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy thoughts on it: (I don't have much knowledge so don't take this as the end all or whatever the saying is. Just an average joe trying to understand Islam and maybe it helps someone out, or maybe I learn something too)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first hadith basically says that everything has already been decided that we WILL do that no matter what. But here's where the difference comes in. Imagine two individuals:\n\n1. A person says \"if I'm supposed to do it anyway what's wrong with that?\" and transgresses beyond all bounds. In the end he or she will commit them as much as it was written for them, not more not less.\n2. A person seeks refuge with Allah and tries as hard as they can to avoid it. They WILL slip up every now and then as much as Allah decided they would. As soon as this person does, they would instantly feel regret, seek forgiveness and again continue to try their best not to do it again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn both cases, the individuals will do as much zina and adultery as is written for them. The zina or adultery of the eyes, the mouth, ears, etc. The difference would be that since 1 did not repent it would just add to the punishment for them, for 2 it could be that the sin humbled them more (for example, the person was becoming religious, and got arrogant, then after the sin realized \"I really am nothing\" or something like that), and at the same time it brings them closer to Allah since they seek refuge with Him from the evil of their nafs. They realize even more that they need Allah more than ever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cases I gave were very specific, it doesn't account for the case where 1 seeks forgiveness later in life or if 2 starts to transgress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember to seek forgiveness for the sins of each part after every prayer. I normally just add in \"forgive the sins of each atom of my being\" not sure if that's the correct way to say it though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMay Allah protect us from the whispers of the Shaytan, and from all those who wish to harm us from among men and djinn. May He protect us from the evil of our nafs, and may He forgive all of our sins.\n\nAllah knows best\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I thought I'd add this for anyone who may not understand but it includes seeing pictures and videos as well, not just pornography.\n\nNowadays it's exceptionally hard thanks to billboards in our faces on the daily commute, advertisements (sadly even while using Qur'an apps), and the oversexualization of characters in tv shows, cartoons (even for kids like Tom and Jerry as surprising as that is), and video games which i mentioned earlier. Then there's the music. We're literally surrounded by things that are attacking us from all sides (I wanted to quote what Shaytan said here but can't find the ayah).\n\nThis is one of the reasons the muslim world is in turmoil.\n\nAnd to give credit where it's due, it's thanks to u/keyboard-citizen for mentioning this:\n\n\"Rather than fighting, he told the army to focus on getting them to commit adultery because he knew that **Allah would not allow a nation with adulterers to win**.\"\n\nHow Musa Alayhi Salaam's army (bani israel) was defeated.", "Take the following with a grain of saltYesterday, I learned about the New Zealand Mosque shooting from a Muslim friend of mine. I know everyone else has said this at this point, but I'd just like to say that I'm terribly sorry for what happened and wish the best for everyone. However...\n\nParents, millenials, particularly teenagers, nowadays are developing Internet Addiction more than ever. As a millenial myself, I know this. Obviously, video games shouldn't be blamed for terrible events like this, but if you haven't been monitoring what your kid does on the internet,  I would highly suggest that now you start being responsible because nelligence, not video games, is the real reason why kids are becoming hateful towards both others and themselves. A kid who isn't monitored is a kid who spreads cancer. I know that not all parents are like this, but it's been a recurring problem that needs to stop. The fact that the shooter said to Subscribe to Pewdiepie before shooting the Mosque shows that even memes are being taken out of character by some people today, so if you don't monitor your kids, there is a possibilty they could do similar things. It's not your fault if they do commit criminal offenses, but I'm bringing this all up because I think that we should try to prevent tragedies like this from occuring again. Not everything can be prevented, but every effort counts.\n\nNon-parents are no exception. I heard from my earlier mentioned friend that some people, not all though, felt bad for the scooter, suggesting that he had a bad upbringing. While a bad upbringing can be the reason people do undescribably horrible things to others like the shooter did, it is never an excuse. It doesn't justify these crimes in the slightest. It's NEVER a jail out of free card to do things like this. If you are mentally disturbed from a bad upbringing, you should seek therapy, not people to lash out at. Even parents who don't monitor their children are not to convict; while they DO play a factor, and they should seriously consider this, it is still always the criminal's choice to commit the crime. I myself am not a parent, so it really saddens me that some people excuse terrorism like this. There are Muslim extremeists in the world, but there are extremeists in every group of people. I'm a Christian and I know for a fact that there are some Christians who despise gay people. There are even Atheists who bash Christians. But does that mean every single Christian hates gay people and all Atheists bash Christians? Of course not! Therefore, people who commit hateful crimes, such as this shooting, have no excuse to go after people like that, no matter how traumatic their childhood, and the people who justify this kind of behavior should be utterly ashamed with themselves.\n\nI hope that this is a wake up call to the people I described, even though it shouldn't have taken the pointless deaths of those innocent people to make them realize everything I've said. Thank you all for taking the time to read this long ramble. I hope I haven't offended anyone today because that's not what I was going for at all.", "Muslim r4r\nI'm a Somali 28F from Australia and just about at the end of my tether looking for a compatible man to marry.

I'm  5'4 (5'5 on a good day!), weigh 63kg and I'm told attractive (probs only because of the symmetry of my face \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) \n\nI'm looking for someone who shares some of my interests, is willing to join in the fight to save the world from capitalism, funny, caring, not necessarily Somali but preferably black, at least 5'7 in height, attractive and most of all God fearing. I'm willing to relocate depending on location. \n\nIf this sounds like you and you're liking what you're reading about, shoot me a PM with a little blurb about yourself/a selfie and InshaAllah kheir! \n\nThanks for reading! \n", "What images are haram to make?This question is something that I am very confused about because there are so many perspectives, and it's hard to find an answer. For context, I am currently developing a 2D game and I want to implement some characters who resemble animate objects (player looks like a person, animal enemies, etc.) I read that it is impermissible to make any images of animate objects, but if you remove the facial features of something like a person than it becomes permissible. If this is true however, then how come it is permissible for us to watch cartoons or play video games that have images of characters with faces and other features, but we are not allowed to create them? Also is it permissible to create fictional characters or animals, and if so can they have features?\n\nThere is also a second issue I have, it's not related to images but I might as well include it here. I want to put background music for my game, and my idea was that I would put some electronic tune or something with no vocals. Apparently this is haram but it is not clear?", "Videogames, gateway to indecencyAsalamualaikum, \n\nThis is one of many things which I'd say are gateways to indecency. InshAllah I'll try my best to stay on topic. \n\nWe all know what psychology is, and its been popular for a long time. How the human mind works, individuals, groups, children, adults. It's used when it comes to propaganda (of course, if it wasn't propaganda would be useless). \n\nThe best way to make someone deviate from a certain path is to make them believe it was their own idea. It's how the Shaytan works and Shaytan has provided many tools to mankind which were used against the believers. Such as the story of how he introduced musical instruments which was part of a chain of events leading to zina. \n\nOnce we understand that Shaytan works in this way, he doesn't just make you go straight to the end otherwise no one would ever do anything wrong. He whittles away at our imaan, or just conscience if you will, so we first do something harmless and work our way up. \n\nNext, our brains are a lot more complex than we still understand. Visualization is a very, very strong technique which can have a huge positive or negative effect on our lives. For example, if someone constantly tells themselves \"this is too hard, i can't do it\" they most likely never will, the opposite is true too. \n\nIf you think back to when you were children and the games we played then. You'll probably remember them in a very nice way. Then if you were to play again you'd probably start thinking \"i don't remember it looking this bad. The movements aren't smooth..\" etc. \n\nWhen you play, we imagine ourselves being that character to some degree. Or in that place. If something happens like you fall from a big enough height (in game) you might physically feel the fear of falling or something. \n\nThey create a false sense of accomplishment. We feel like we did something when all we did was waste our time. As muslims, we have to think \"i could've used that time to study Qur'an\" or some other beneficial thing for us. \n\nThere are so many things here if you think on it, the most important one, which is the main reason for this post, is our sense of morality. \n\nIn real life we would probably never hurt a random individual on the street. But in video games we give ourselves the excuse \"it's fictional\" \"they're not real\" and whatever else. \n\nI remember there was a time where people turned against video games teaching violence and it was shut down very quickly. \n\nDepending on the game, we feel nothing killing or hurting hundreds because it's just another score. And worst of all is the shirk. \n\nMost games today have religions in them, none of them include Islam. Our excuse there is, again, \"it's fictional\" and \"that's just how it is, don't ruin my fun\". \n\nI made a post a while back about \"Rabbul Alameen\" which means \"Lord of all the worlds\". That includes the world of men, djinn, the birds, the dogs, the fish, every animal has its own world. \n\nYour world will be different from my world based on the people around you, the experiences you have, etc. Suppose someone is going through a rough patch, they're surrounded by depression, sickness and death, etc. That's their world. \nThen someone else who just got a promotion, everyone around them is happy, successful. Just bought a new house, got a new car, etc etc. That's their world. \n\nAllah is the Lord of the fictional world too. Since these are relatively new things, and i haven't heard any fatwas related to this technology (that people haven't ridiculed) it makes sense that this is the best way to lead people astray. But, if we really think on it and try to understand, we have to realize the Qur'an applies to everything we do, our real world or the fictional worlds in our heads. \n\nI don't know what the case is, we need scholars to tell us. But just think, as a Muslim, Allah will question our actions in private. Will \"it's fictional\" be a valid justification? \n\nI guess another way to look at it would be like, if you read a dirty book vs an educational one? It's not real, but you still imagine it. Video games just imagine it for you. \n\nTLDR of above: our brains think what we see on the screen is real. That's why we still feel fear, excitement, anger, etc. We give excuses for the actions we take in video games, i personally believe they're haram but it's not easy to quit, it's like a drug. And i also believe that we'll be held responsible in front of Allah for the actions we take in the games, including willingly following along with the Shirk. \n\nEdit: i said i personally believe they are haram without knowledge, Astaghfirullah. As others have mentioned in the comments this is for the people with knowledge to decide.\n\nI've heard something about how scholars said something, then everyone insulted them and laughed because it's all fake. \n\n*** \n\nFinally, regardless of what you think or how you feel. It really will corrupt the minds of our youth so i beg each and every one of you please keep your children safe from these things. You can't protect them when they go to a friend's house, but you can make a stronger bond where they're willing to talk. \nThere are there rights a parent has to their child. The first is to choose a good spouse. So this right applies even before you're married. \nThe second is to choose a good name. One that has a good meaning in your own language especially. \nThe third, is the first thing you should teach them is the Qur'an. With translation and tafsir, i personally believe there's no point in being a hafiz if you have no idea what you read.\n\nInshAllah, if we do those things the right way, and tell them what's right and wrong. Don't do the things you don't want them to do in front of them. It's better to stop entirely yourself. And MOST importantly, NEVER mention someone's mistakes or failings in front of their child, or your own child in case they say it to tease them. Don't do it. \n\nHmmm.. Maybe the children thing should've been a separate post \n\nEdit: I accept that this is related to some, not all games. I'll move to a higher level issue which i believe cover it. \n\nI made a post regarding Dajjal and how we're all getting ready for him. I mentioned in that post that he won't go around violently killing people or harming us, instead he'll invite us with things we enjoy. \n\nWith video games we have a sense of immersion which is more noticeable in some people than others. We're given things we personally enjoy, various genres which would be gateways into worse things. \n\nThere are many things that go into it, worshipping our desires which could be boiled down to spending too much time on something we enjoy which can't benefit us (in the next life). \n\nThen comes the issue of answering the questions about how we spent our time, how we spent our wealth. And i think i mentioned our hearts being chipped away. \n\nAs one comment pointed out i made a mistake of generalizing all of these things in one post which is why it's gotten so long. InshAllah I'll try to split it up and make new ones in the future. \n\nMy intention with this is only to give a warning, it doesn't look like we're on the right track ", "Music addiction, finding inner peaceAsalamualaikum, \n\nI actually got the idea to post this after commenting about music on another post. I usually tell this experience to everyone I meet and realized why not here, maybe it'll help someone else out. \n\nMusic is addicting. Actually, anything can be addicting depending on the person. The biggest things I can think of off the top of my head are: \n1) Sugar (I won't mention any other food items, just this one is a really bad addiction. We get kids hooked on it from a very young age) \n2) TV (Movies, serials, expanded to include whatever is available online)\n3) Just the Internet itself (the sheer amount of things to do on it, keeping you up late into the night)\n4) Video games \n5) Music \n\nAfter listing these out I feel like I should write separate posts explaining each, let me know if anyone would be interested in hearing about them in the comments. \n\nSo, many people argue about the legality, with respect to Islam, of music. I'm not a scholar but i like to follow a basic rule of thumb. If any haram topics are brought up in the song then it's better to avoid it. These can include anything ranging from sex, drugs, clubbing, violence, even regular old love. The reason i mention love is, according to Islam we should love to please Allah. I hope that made sense. Similarly if anything starts to take your attention away from, or completely away from, Allah, since we are supposed to be mindful of Him at all times. \n\nNow, here's the experience: \nI used to listen to a lot of music, basically if i was able i would be playing something. It got to the point where if it was too quiet for too long I'd start getting irritated and feel like i needed some background noise. \nFor a few months i went to a different country, i didn't take my smart phone, and i didn't have any mp3 player of any sort. I did take my laptop though. Once i got there i bought one of those old push button cell phones since it was cheap. So now for the entire trip to work, using public transport, i would just be sitting quietly and be left with my thoughts. Work for 10+ hours, go home. Once i got home i got in the habit of exercising right away, eating dinner, then sleep. \nI used to work 6 days out of the week, so i barely got any free time. The 7th day I'd be too tired to do anything so i would just sleep most of the day away. \nI was irritable at first but eventually i felt this sense of calm. My mind felt so clear, it changed so many aspects of my life, i suddenly became way more patient. I could sit and not do anything for hours without feeling bored or tired. I started sleeping faster, waking up feeling refreshed. It was just amazing. \n\nI didn't leave music out entirely, in what free time i got eating dinner i would either watch something on tv, which usually has music in it, or just listen to one or two songs. Now I'm at the point where if i do listen to anything, it'll probably be once or twice in a week. Sometimes not at all. \n\nIf you can't give up music entirely, if you listen to it every now and then it won't have such a negative effect. I've seen people who have headphones in their ears most of the day. Our brains get used to so much stimulation that when we stop we literally have to detox, it's the same with any other addiction. Like if you stop eating sugar, or try to quit smoking. \n\nExcess of anything is bad. \n\n\nOur physical bodies are a lot simpler than we'd like to think when it comes to these things. If you've noticed it, every song has a certain \"sound\" to it. No one told us it should be that way, you hear a song and you know right away whether it's a sad or happy song, and whatever else there is. The combination of frequencies and sound can affect our own emotions directly, literally to the point where it can control them. Again, it will depend from person to person, i wouldn't suggest testing it out but if you start listening to only sad songs, and listen to them a lot, eventually you will start actually feeling sad or even depressed. When i got addicted to music it got to the point where when i was feeling a certain way I'd look for songs to compliment my mood which amplified the effect. \n\nNow whether people would want to believe this or not, it seems to me that these things, especially those with the help of technology, are basically forms of magic, although we're used to thinking of magic only as black magic (done with the help of djinns) or the fantasy magic like using the fireball spell or something. ", "Thoughts on music, long postAssalam wa alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu\n\nI'm not going to discuss the permissibility of music, as we already know there is ikhtilaf on it and there are those who believe it is haram and those who believe it is halal (with conditions). I would just like to share some thoughts I've had regarding my recent experiences with music.\n\nI've always enjoyed music. Mostly video game and classical with some anime and rock songs thrown in. Absolutely no modern pop and stuff, not only is the music itself unappealing but also charged with filth and lewdness. I never play radio music ever, it makes me cringe and I would agree that such music is indeed haram. I stick to my video game soundtracks and Debussy. But never has music interfered with my obligations in the deen. I've never let it distract me from salah or the Quran. I often listen to music in solitude, sometimes while staring out my window at the trees and clouds. It strengthens my appreciation for the beautiful world Allah has created and many a time has left me awestruck at nature, such as wind swaying tree branches in rhythm with the orchestra. \n\nUntil about a few months ago, I never felt any negative feelings because of listening to music. And I've read on the topic long before then. But recently I've been experiencing some turmoil over listening to music. I feel some guilt nowadays when listening to music, not because I think I'm sinning (I believe I'm not sinning), but because I feel that other Muslims who do believe it is impermissible would judge me and think me to be a bad Muslim. I fear Allah, fulfill my obligations, and resist urges in order to avoid haram actions, but I feel that if some Muslims, like one of my friends, knew I listened to music, they would think I care nothing for the deen at all and that's what bothers me.\n\nI've also been thinking about Ibn Masud's quote- \"The love of music and the love of Quran cannot both exist in the heart of a believer\". I can't really say I love either. I don't love music, I enjoy listening to it and it makes me happy, but I don't love music so much as the feeling of happiness and nostalgia I get, which I can also reach just by reminiscing silently. \n\nUnfortunately, I can't say I love the Quran yet because I don't really know what loving the Quran means. I read Quran, attempt to memorize more of it, and read the translations, which often make me tremble or fill my heart with joy depending on what I read. The translation of Surah Tariq, for example, produces a powerful feeling in my chest. I don't read enough Quran since I'm busy with medical school and prone to wasting time on YouTube and reading books, but Alhamdulillah I've made more of an effort the last few weeks and I will continue it inshaAllah. I expect that as I read, memorize, and ponder more of the Quran, I'll learn to \"love\" it. \n\nBut I don't think that's going to kill all desire for music. Music and Quran serve different purposes to me. The Quran helps me better understand and fulfill my role and duties as a Muslim and brings me closer to Allah. Music lets me experience nostalgia, joy in the moment, and makes me desire Jannah even more so I can see the most beautiful sights accompanied by the most beautiful sounds. This isn't to say that I can balance the love of music and love of Quran in my heart, Ibn Masud knows way better than I do, but I don't think it has to be strictly binary.\n\nI know that everyone recommends replacing music with Quran entirely and honestly that can also apply to anything like watching TV or reading worldly books or most leisure activities. Personally, I can only read and enjoy the Quran by setting aside dedicated time for it during which I'm focused on that and nothing else. I can't use it as background when studying, doing household chores, driving, showering, other mundane activities. I use music instead and it helps me be at peace.\n\nI know there are those who say to only listen to nasheed instead. I actually refuse to listen to nasheeds because I think they're pointless. I view a nasheed as a vehicle to strengthen one's iman and fill one's heart with love for Allah and the deen while still having musical appeal. I don't see why I should ever listen to nasheed because if the purpose of a nasheed is to increase your appreciation and love for Allah, then you could easily accomplish that and more with the Quran alone. I can strengthen my iman and love the deen by reading the Quran without some accompanying vocal melody. \n\nSometimes we want to believe what fits our desires, to believe what we enjoy is halal and what we hate is haram. I try to avoid this and I'll give a recent example. I thought it was haram to marry a Christian woman who commits shirk and read arguments for both sides. Even though the argument of its impermissibility appealed to me personally, I found the argument of its permissibility more convincing despite it going against my biases. I genuinely find the argument of music's permissibility more convincing, and I don't let my bias interfere in my assessment. Again, I'm not trying to discuss the permissibility of it, but relating it to my thoughts. I struggle with coping with med school, as I really hate science but my parents forced me to do this. I've been meaning to start a recreational hobby to help me relax and bring more routine and discipline into my life. I want to learn the violin, but I feel I'll be plagued by feelings of guilt as I practice because somewhere out there other Muslims believe I'm on the path to Jahannam. \n\nAnd although I do not believe music is haram, I don't think I'll ever ask Allah to help me improve my skill with the violin. It's a mundane leisure activity with no religious significance and ultimately not that important to me, so I don't see the point in making dua for it. Similarly, I've never asked Allah to help me beat some video game bosses, even though video games are halal (at least the ones I'm talking about- Skyrim boi). I only ask Allah for help on serious matters which will affect my dunya and akhirah. I know that the Sahaba used to ask for even trivial matters and I will try to make a habit of this inshaAllah. But I don't count violin leisure as a matter in the first place. I have to admit though, I feel this strange discomfort when I think of making dua for the sake of improving my violin skills, as if it would be an insult to Allah. Again, I think it's due to fear of being judged by other Muslims, as in \"Astaghfirullah, how can this brother ask Allah to improve his ability to engage in evil?\"\n\nSometimes I worry that this could be a dealbreaker for marriage. Perhaps I may meet a sister with whom I'm very compatible, but she believes music is haram. She may reject me for that, but even if we did get married, there would certainly be some tension when I'm enjoying some music out in the garden or playing my violin. I wonder how much this will complicate my search for a spouse, and fear that I personally will never meet a sister who fulfills her obligations and listens to music as well.\n\nThere's other stuff I wanted to mention, but the post is long enough and I can't remember the other topics. I just wanted to express my thoughts, as I'm afraid of saying this to my imam (who says clapping is haram) and getting judged by him. JazakAllahu khairan for reading and I'll be glad to read anyone's thoughts.\n\n", "Azrail waitsAsallamualaikum brothers and sisters, \n\nEdit: very important, all guidance is from Allah alone. Based on personal experience, trying to understand and contemplating things will, inshallah, lead us to Him. \n\n(note: I am a fool who was ignorant and I hope you all forgive me. I pray Allah forgives me too and continues to guide me. Inshallah everything I post from today onwards is not to preach or anything, but my intention is just to get people to think. Take what you can out of all of this, and just think on it and come to your own conclusions. I would love to have discussions with anyone, whether in the comments or private messages)\n\nAllah guides us in so many mysterious ways, today I was guided once more to yet another reminder of death, the inevitable part of our greater lives. \n\nBefore anything else, I would like to tell a story, Alhamdulillah it is amazing. If I make any mistakes in it please do let me know. \n\nIt is about Prophet Idris Alayhi Sallam. A little background info, Idris (Enoch) was a prophet during the time Prophet Adam Alayhi Sallam was still alive. He would teach about the generosity of Allah, and the excellence of Islam. It is said that he was the first man to use a pen, of course granted the knowledge by Allah. After his death, many of his followers, as is expected, deviated from Islam and Nuh (Noah) Alayhi Sallam was appointed over them. \n\nThe story I want to share is about the death of Idris Alayhi Sallam. Allah revealed to him that He would grant him the reward of all of the good deeds done by all of the children of Adam Alayhi Sallam, in addition to his own, until the day he died. Seeking to increase his reward, when a friend of Idris from the angels visited him, Idris Alayhi Sallam said to him \"Allah has revealed to me such and such, so could you please take me to the angel of death, that I could increase my deeds\". Basically to ask to delay his death. The angel carried the Prophet upon his wings and went up to search, they searched the first, the second, the third heavens, until they found the angel of death in the fourth looking around, confused. \n\nThe angel spoke to him about what Idris had asked before, the angel of death asked \"and where is Idris?\" to which the angel replied \"upon my back\". The angel of death was surprised, praised Allah, and said \"I was sent to take his soul in the fourth heaven, and kept thinking how could I do that if he is on earth?\" \n\nThe angel of death took his soul then and there. \n\nThere are many things we can learn from this one story but our concern is with death. \n\nDeath can come at any time, a decade, a year, a month, a week, a day, an hour, minute or second from now. It could even find us this instant. \nSomeone once said \"When the doctor tells us we have a few months left to live we get scared and start making plans and getting our affairs in order, but when Allah says it can come at any time we think nothing of it\". \n\nDon't sit back and let life go by, DO SOMETHING. \n\nComplete your obligations in Islam. \nGive charity without fear of poverty, all of your wealth will be useless to you one day. \n\nDon't be afraid to follow sunnah or live an Islamic life because other people might judge you or avoid you, or even out of fear of what they will do to you, death will find them one day too. \n\nAnd always remember, the muslims that came before us went through it all if not worse. \n\nTrust in Allah and follow your dreams, they could be the medicine this world needs. Don't sit back and wait for others to make a difference, start it with yourself. \n\nI lived in fear most of my life, torn between two thoughts. On one hand I really wanted to do things I believed were good and would please Allah, that they may make a difference in the world around me. Then on the other hand people would say \"get this education, get a job, save up money, then do whatever you want\" because that's the \"smart thing to do\". \n\nBefore I share some ayahs, I'll tell you this. I've read the Quran first. Then every self help article, the habits of successful people, the stories of people like Steve jobs and bill gates, I realized that all of those things are what Allah tells us. Steve jobs life was going to hell but he never lost sight of his goal, Allah tells us to trust in Him and be patient, keep working for what you want and inshallah of will come to you. People look at the bad things and say the good that came after was only because of that bad. Allah wants us to be successful, but we give in to societal pressures and fall behind. \n\nHere are a few things from the Quran, so much wisdom is enclosed in this one book. Every sentence, every word, has so much behind it, it truly is the word of Allah. We might pronounce the words but don't truly read it. \n\n(Apologies since there's no proper order) \n\n>And your Lord says: Call on Me; I will answer your prayer...\n>(Al-Ghaafir:60)\n\n>Then We put there on the right Way of Religion: so follow thou that Way and follow not the desires of those who know not\n>(Al-Jaathiya:18)\n\n>The mutual rivalry for piling up the good things of this world diverts from the more serious things, until ye visit the graves. But nay, ye shall soon know the reality.\n>(At-Takaathur:1-3)\n\n>Allah! There is no god but He: and on Allah, therefore, let the believers put their trust\n>(At-Taghaabun:13)\n\n>And He provides for him from sources he could never imagine. And if any one puts his trust in Allah, sufficient is Allah for him. For Allah will surely accomplish his purpose: verily, for all things has Allah appointed a due proportion\n>(At-Talaaq:3)\n\nI could keep going but I hope you get the idea. Don't let fear hold you back, believe in Allah, that whatever you strive to do will work out. Don't get disheartened, don't give up even if the world goes against you. If in the end it didn't work out, at least when you stand in front of Allah on the promised Day, you can say \"I did my best\". \n\nDon't be afraid of what will happen. \n\nTake a few moments to analyze your life today, and ask yourself if it's good enough? \nThink about your life today, remove certain things, remove the distractions of things like YouTube, reddit, music, tv, video games and see if you're happy with where you are. Figure out what changes you can make, they don't have to be drastic changes, even something as small as \"I'll start taking an hour to go out on walks with my kids\" minus the technology. \n\nAnother thing I've noticed, people talk about money in such a way that they may even forget Allah. I know the world is changing, not for the better, but we have to remember we're allowing it to go this way. \n\nIn the Quran Allah says how the earth grows produce for us to eat, He provided us things for free that we may use, but we're slowly putting a price on everything so much so that people who don't have money \"don't deserve to live\". They can't get good medical care, they can't get good food, access to good education, etc. And then there's the distraction, big businesses or people donate millions to get kids from poor backgrounds proper education, but none of that is really addressing the bigger issue. But these are my own opinions, I want you all to think and figure out what you can, and I'd love to discuss it, talking about different issues and we can figure out small things that we can do to make a difference. \n\nI quote this surah a lot but it changed my perspective on life: \n\n>Do men think that they will be left alone on saying \"We believe\" and that they will not be tested? \n>We did test those before them, and Allah will certainly know those who are true from those who are false. \n>Do those who practice evil think they will get the better of Us? Evil is their judgement! \n>For those whose hopes are in the meeting with Allah in the Hereafter, let them strive; for the term appointed by Allah is surely coming and He hears and knows all things. \n>And if they strive with might and main, they do so for their own souls: for Allah is free of all needs from all creation. \n>(Al-Ankaboot:1-6)\n\nSome of what I realized from these few lines: \n1) A Muslim will never have a life of ease in this world. There will always be some difficulty facing them, some struggle. They are tests for us which we should welcome since they give us a chance to prove ourselves to Allah, regardless of what shape or form these tests come in. Whether it is in the form of missile strikes or chemical weapons, or something as small as the prick of a thorn while handling a rose. Maybe you worked hard to buy a house and the house was damaged by a flood. Maybe you lost a loved one, or you gain something in the form of money or children. \n\n>Be sure We shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in goods or lives, or the fruits of your toil, but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere, who say, when afflicted with calamity: \"To Allah we belong, and to Him is our return.\"\n>(Al-Baqarah:155,156)\n\n2) we need to be careful of evil, feigning ignorance to something will not save us from Allah, and we fool and harm only ourselves. Many people say \"Islam is not meant to be a burden\" but forget the struggles of our ancestors. The sahabas went through the worst torture, lost wealth, family, loved ones, all for Islam. They did not change Islam to suite themselves, but changed themselves to suite Islam. They \"guarded themselves from sin\". We need to take more active roles, we might not like what we find, but we have to look at our lives and figure out if something is wrong. \n\nI'm sure we can all agree that working for a company that produces and supplies alcohol is not good (I don't want to use the word haram because I don't have the knowledge to do so). Based on this, among other things, we must look at our own sources of income, see the products we work to create, support, market, supply, or sell, and figure out if it is good or bad. Based on personal experiences, knowledge, and just thinking on things, I can say that working with cigarettes is not good, similarly anything related to movies and tv shows (there may be exceptions like when reaching Islamic lessons but there are others who know a lot more than me). Working with anything related to sugars, so soft drinks, junk food, I believe this is not good since they are not necessary for survival or sustenance, and do more harm than good. Such as, kids get addicted to sugar and become life long customers for sugary products, even though scientists found links between white sugar and arthritis, obviously diabetes, even cancer. Anyway, I'm not pushing my opinions here, just examples but I leave the end decisions to you. \n\n3) and this is the most important one which sums up everything else. \n(Imagine this next line in bold)\nWhatever you do, it makes no difference to Allah. \n\nIf you choose to become a gangster, or a pious scholar who starts soup kitchens and gives all of his wealth to raise orphans and help the poor and needy. \nIf you choose to read the Quran, or read magazines to find out about the lives of celebrities or whatever the sports people are called in football, or whatever else there is. \n\nThe thing to keep in mind is, I will not answer for your actions or deeds, just as you will not answer for my actions or deeds. We will answer for whatever we did or said, but not what others did or said. \n\nAllah will test us, but it does not matter to him what we do. Suppose you're walking and there is a rock in the middle of the sidewalk or pathway. It doesn't matter if you choose to move it or ignore it. \n\nTo sum it all up, think, ponder, try to understand, actively try to change yourself and help those around you so that they may do the same. Gain knowledge and pass it on. Maybe, just maybe the world may begin to shift towards good. Do whatever you can, since it will only help to save your own soul. \n\nAnd keep in mind the limited time we all have. Azrail is waiting for each and every one of us. Even he may not understand the time and the place, but Allah knows best and Allah is the best of planners. \n\nP.S. VERY IMPORTANT \nI do not in any way mean to say that small acts are worthless. Even smiling at someone is considered charity, and in this way Islam does not burden us. We don't have to be a \"superhero\", and we don't have to leave everything in our lives. Just slowly change ourselves for the better. Islam wasn't revealed in a day. \nAnd there may be people in debt whether it's bills, medical, educational, or funeral bills even, or may be stuck due to uncontrollable reasons. \nAll muslims are my brothers and sisters, we are of the family of Ibrahim Alayhi Sallam. I want nothing more than all of us to succeed together. \n\nIf I hinted at anything close to the opposite of a pure and sincere message I apologize and hope you will forgive me. ", "What's the rationale for so many benign things being (possibly) haram?I know there are differences of opinion on the following issues. What I'm wondering is how those scholars who interpret these acts to be haram came to that conclusion. Most haram acts have clear reasoning behind why they're haram, such as zina, usury, alcohol, murder, etc. I don't understand why silk is haram for men tho.\n\nBut upon what basis do some scholars interpret the following acts to be haram?\n\n-Clapping to show approval\n-Whistling\n-Soft music that doesn't incite one towards evil\n-Celebrating birthdays\n-Celebrating anniversaries\n-Pants hanging below ankles\n-Drawing people and animals\n-Playing video games or reading stories featuring fictional gods\n-Hanging paintings on the wall\n\nHow do any of the above harm others or ourselves? I doubt some guy doodling in class and drawing animals or people is trying to compete with Allah as a creator. Or some guy hanging a painting of a tree on his wall is somehow making it an idol and now the angels won't visit his house.\n\nSometimes when I read scholars explaining how these small insignificant issues are haram, I get mad that this is the kind of stuff the ummah focuses disproportionate amounts of time on instead of tackling more important issues like the prevalence of zina and apathy toward Islam among the youth or perhaps the lack of Islamic education around the world giving rise to atrocities like honor killings and female genital mutilation.\n\nI can't even begin to imagine how a kind and fair man who fulfills the five pillars is nearing Jahannam because he likes to draw birds at the park.\n", "A dumb but serious questionSo this prolly sounds stupid but its a serious question. Do Muslims eat pork in video games or do they not eat pork in video games too. (Ik this is stupid but i just thought about it for a while)", "I think I'm genderqueer, how do I stop these feelings?This is gonna be a wall of text so be warned. I'm a 15 year old muslim girl, but my whole life I've always liked both boy's things (weapons, adventure, even clothing that would be considered boyish) but I also like girls stuff (makeup, clothing, and that stuff) Even before I knew that such a thing as \"sexuality\" existed, I've considered cross dressing a few times, even as a kid, and thought how cool it would be to go out in public dressed like a boy. I've wondered what it would be like to be a boy quite a lot. I attempted cross dressing once, I used my little bro's clothes (which kind of fit me cause I'm super damn tiny) and really liked how I looked in them. I didn't think I was weird or anything (cause I was a middle schooler and hadn't even heard the term sexuality yet or knew what that was) A few days ago, I tried to make my hair look like a boy's (which was impossible) and I actually felt a little upset that I couldn't do it. \n\nRecently I've been questioning my gender identity, cause like, I want to be a boy, but I also want to be a girl, like at the same time. Cause I like boy's and girls' hair/clothing, I like fashion and makeup, but I also like weapons and nerf wars with my cousins, and adventure and that stuff. People at school sometimes told me to \"act more feminine\" and if I ever acted violent they'd tell me to \"stop acting like a boy\".\n\nI'm a bit sad because I want to be able to be both genders at the same time, I even designed an outfit that looks both boyish and girly at the same time, and it looked so nice. But I can't wear it irl cause I don't have the stuff in the outfit. (damn it) I also wanted to get my hair cut in a boy's style (which I have told my mom) but I asked her if we could do it so it looks boyish but feminine at the same time. (spoiler alert, she said no cause she liked my hair the way it is and thought it was too short already) It's like, I want it at a short length, like the length of a boy's hair, but I want it to have bangs and make it free flowing in a way so it also looks feminine (I also drew out the hairstyle it's hard to describe) And I love it so much but I'm sad cause I can't do this irl. \n\nI've wanted to tell my parents for a while now in hopes that they would help me get rid of these feelings, but they are super homo/trans phobic, they absolutely loathe and hate the lgbt community and it's supporters, they think lgbt people are disgusting scum. They'd kill me if I told them, they'd ban me from the internet (because apparently looking at cat pics and gaming videos is somehow gonna make me not straight) and from anything electronic (cause they'll blame the video games for this like they always do) which I don't want. They'll say I've been brainwashed, and all that, and I get enough 40 minute lectures every other day without making them add to them -\\_- \n\nI apologize for the massive essay of this, but I think something is wrong with me cause I'm a girl so I shouldn't feel this way, and islam says it's wrong. I don't think feelings are a sin in islam (I hope not because if they are then I'm f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*) and I think that you are only judged on your actions? (I hope) but yeah does anyone know how to get rid of these feelings cause at this point they're making me feel sad (cause I can't dress like both a boy and a girl because religion) and I don't want to live my life feeling sad about this, I tried getting myself interested in outfits and hair that are only for girls but I didn't like them nearly as much as the both-gender outfits I drew. I also don't want to go to hell for this, but I also really want to do this (dress and act like both genders) So any help would be appreciated. ", "Why muslims fail today and some adviceAsalamualaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu my brothers and sisters in Islam. \n\nI want to apologize if anything sounds offensive in all this. I only want that my brothers and sisters should get to the right track. There's no point reading all of this if you will not learn anything from it so please go in with an open mind and bear with me. If there's anything that you don't already do or didn't know of please try to incorporate it in your life somehow. I'm a nobody but if you want to talk about anything like discuss something feel free to send me a message. But again I'm not really good for advice, I can say things like this which are on a broad scale. If you think there's any useful information please spread it with others around you like friends, family, ask your local imam about it and they will be able to give much better advice in-shaa-allah. \n\nThe advice below isn't just for muslims ofc, non-muslims can benefit from it too and hopefully it brings them closer to Islam in the process. \n\nStart: \n\nBismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem, \n\nWatch these two videos if you haven't already and come back here. \n\n[Steve Jobs 2005 Stanford Commencement Speech](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc)\n\n[They want you to be poor](https://youtu.be/m6pWEzkbnDE)\n\nThere was an image on r/Izlam someone made about two people digging for diamonds. There was a big diamond if they followed Shariah and nothing by following the rest of the world or whatever but it's relevant. \n\nNote: message at end for people who can't make big/drastic changes in their life. \n\nIf you've watched the videos completely or just until you got an idea of what's being said in them, for anyone that has even the most basic knowledge of Islam you'll know that Allah already gave us that advice and information since the Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam. \n\nI won't be able to cover everything involved but just to give an idea: \n\nStanford commencement speech - patience and perseverance. Just to give the simplest example: \n\nSurah Al-'Asr - 103\n>By time, \n>Indeed, mankind is in loss, \n>Except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience. \n\nIt's been said that when you work towards the Akhira Allah will give you Dunya as well. So let's look at how this simple surah applies to this rock floating around in a sea of nothingness. \n\n>By time, Indeed, mankind is in loss. \n\nThis might be familiar to a lot of us. Have you ever told yourself\n\n\"When I have such and such then I'll do that thing I've always wanted to do\" \n\n\"I can't right now but one day I'll do it\" \n\n\"I'm not ready\"\n\nEtc etc. \n\nYou may have heard this quote: \n\"Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans\" - John Lennon \n\nFor the people who've been saying that for the past few years, how many of you have looked back at all the time you've lost and said \"if only I started it back then, I'd be where I wanted to be today\" or similar? \n\nIf you find yourself in that position, first of all don't worry about it: \n\n>If anything befalls you, do not say \"if only I had done such and such\" rather say \"Qaddara Allahu wa ma sha'a fa'ala\" (Allah has decreed and whatever He wills, He does). For (saying) 'if' opens (the door) to the deeds of Satan. \nSunan Ibn Majah, vol 1 book 1 hadith 79, grade: Sahih (Darussalam) \n\nOnce you accept that and don't let it get to you, start doing it now. Shaytaan **wants** you to spiral into depression or regret and waste even more time. Don't wait any longer. You won't even get a second of your time back so no point crying over that, focus on what you do have. \n\nNext part of the surah \n\n>Except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other patience. \n\nAllah doesn't say anything like: \n- except the ones that spend years preparing \n- only those who have money \n- those who have property, servants \n\nAll that's mentioned here is \n1) Stick to Islam, pray, fast, salah, etc. Dunya benefits - you **stick to a proper schedule**. Go to sleep after Isha, wake up for fajr. Get your work done in the morning hours because \n\n>Allah made the early hours blessed for my Ummah. \nI don't have a source for this one, I've heard it a-lot but you know what, it makes sense. \n\n>And made your sleep for rest, \n>And made the night as a covering, \n>And made the day as a means of subsistence. \nSurah an-Naba, 78:9-11 \n\nAnother translation for ayah 11 is \"...the day for seeking livelihood\". The day starts at **Fajr**. \n\n2) Do righteous deeds. No need to get into this, we've been told so many times how when you do something good Allah will help you in all other affairs. \n\n3) Follow the truth - learn knowledge that is beneficial for you. Don't fall for any lies other people tell you, for example, don't run after the things everyone else wants just because they made some money or something. Stick to what is right and keep doing it because it will eventually pay off much more. Advise others to follow it as well, as muslims we have an important rule to keep our Ummah strong and united. \"No Muslim gets left behind\"\n\n4) Be patient. Help each other in difficult times. And no matter what, don't give up just because things aren't going how you planned or progressing as quickly as you planned. \n\nI remember watching a video where a man explained how he got into creating video games, back before I disliked games and was interested in doing it myself. \n\nHe said in the first year he barely earned a living. After the second year he started to barely make minimum wage. After 3-4 years is when he began earning enough, and later he started earning handsome money. I don't remember the exact time frame but it followed that pattern. \n\nAbout the second video - They want you to be poor \n\nMost of us have this mentality where we say \"I can't spend money there because I won't have enough for rent\" or whatever else. We can't spend in charity because I might not have enough by the end of the month. \n\n>Shaytaan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality, while Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And Allah is all-Encompassing and all-Knowing. \nSurah al-Baqarah, 2:268 \n\nThis next piece of advice is very very important. Don't waste money on things you don't **need**. This includes things that do not benefit you physically, mentally, spiritually, etc. This applies to EVERYONE. Yes you can spend on whatever you want, it's your money after all^, you don't have to worry about it until you get to the grave. Surah at-Takaathur. \n\n^ - everything belongs to Allah. From a single speck of dust floating in the air to something unseen near the edge of our universe. \n\nI can't force you to do anything but here's the advice. \n**Stop** buying potato chips and sodas and chocolates and ice creams and movie tickets and whatever else you don't **need** to survive. You will **not** die if you don't have a PlayStation 9000 or an Xbox 64. You will **not** freeze to death of you don't wear a 500 dollar jacket because of a name and chose a 20 dollar jacket instead. \n\nIf you have the money to spare then spend it on charity. If you still want to ~buy those things~ waste it then who am I to stop you? I did my duty which was just to warn you. \n\nAs for people you constantly worry about their finances, **definitely don't waste money on those things**. Just try it out for a month and see how much you can save. Before buying something just ask yourself \"do I really need this?\". Don't give into social pressure, especially in places like Pakistan where branded foreign goods are worshipped: \n\n>And if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah. They follow not except assumption, and they are not but falsifying. \nSurah al-An'am, 6:116 \n\nDon't get me wrong, it doesn't mean you buy really cheap stuff either that'll fall apart within a month so you end up spending a lot more in the long run. \nSpend wisely on necessities, don't waste money on anything that isn't required. \n\n**** \nNote for the people who can't make any radical changes to their lives anymore. Supporting a family so you can't quit your day job to work on a business venture you've always dreamed of getting into, etc. \n\nThere are so many reasons why things end up the way they do. For many of us there are outside forces that have huge effects on the outcome of things so I'm not saying this without accepting that there's a lot that goes into it. \nBut this is a message we muslims NEED to understand. All of the problems we face today are our own fault. If not us, then our parents, or their parents, and so on. \n\n>And whatever strikes you of disaster - it is for what your hands have earned; But He pardons much. \nSurah ash-Shura, 42:30 \n\nThat's the beauty of Islam. No matter what, everything can change from a single point onwards. Allah does not hold a grudge, Allah does not care what you did in the past. Once you realise that \"yes, I did something wrong\" and seek forgiveness for it, and actively try to make a positive change then Allah will not only forgive you for that thing but forgive so many more sins because of it. Alhamdulillah. \n\nIn the case where it was your parents that began the series of events that led you down this path you're on, we get a lot of our parents traits subconsciously. Take some time to really look deep, make sure you're 100% objective. If you find flaws accept that only the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam was perfect. We will make mistakes, Allah knows that. Seek forgiveness for the flaws and actions done because of them, make the intention that you will try to change, and watch how your life will change for the better. \n\nSo that brings us to the final question. \n\"What's next?\" \n\nThe answer is simple. Do better with your kids. Learn Islam and teach them to be who you wish you were. Start acting like, if you can't be, the Muslim you want your kids to be when they grow up. They will subconsciously pick up on your habits and it will become a part of who they are. The things about moving away from family and being your own person are all... I don't want I say anything bad, it's just wrong. We're social creatures, children are a part of who we are whether we like them or not. \n\nLet them take risks, tell them to believe in Allah and never lose hope. Instill that want and need to do good so that when your time comes and you go back to Allah, there should be a constant shower of good deeds from sadaqah jariah. \n\nI'm open to thoughts and suggestions. More importantly I want to find ways to spread the message more to the youth since they will inherit this world after us.", "Hard Heart (?)Assamualaikum,In the past few months, I have been working to reform myself. I used to pray without wudu, and I started doing wudu. I used to use profane language often by habit, and have brought that to nearly zero (it may come out once in a while by mistake, but no longer habitual). I once had a problem with pornography in the past, but was able to overcome, and have remained clean for around 10 days so far, and inshallah, it will be longer. I used to talk to some girls on Instagram fairly often as \"just friends\", but have cut down my contact with those people greatly, limiting it to school related talks, or waving to them in the hallways in order to be polite.Last night, I sat down, ready to repent for my former pornography addiction, as I finally felt that I was worthy enough to ask for forgiveness, and I did, and I sat there for about ten minutes, but no tears came. This would not have been much of a surprise, as I usually do not cry, even in tragedies, but I had read somewhere that my repentance would be accepted if I shed tears in front of Allah the almighty. The only tears that came to my eyes that night, were just the tears the eye produces when tired, not real tears.\n\nWhen I gave up, I returned to my phone, and researched. I went on a few Muslim forums along with Quora, and all of them had a response which spoke of a hard heart. I went on YouTube, and researched what a hard heart means in Islam, and I found many videos on how to fix a hard heart, and symptoms of a hard heart. I learned that a hard heart is one of the worst punishments from Allah (SAW), where the prayer would turn into a chore or nuisance (which I am ashamed to admit has been a thought in my mind before, though less often since I started working to reform myself), that I am unable to cry towards Allah subhanuatallah in my prayer, even in repentance, and that I can have anger, arrogance, etc. in my heart. The thing that I definitely have is anger, and it is something I wish to cease along with my inability to fin comfort in my prayer.\n\nThe websites I went on also provided cures to a hard heart, but all of said cures appear to be beyond my league as a High School Junior. Going to an orphan and patting his head, taking care of the poor and the widows, etc. I can't even control my own little brothers sometimes. There is also the wall of my parents. I do not want them to know that I think I have a hard heart. I do not wish for them to worry even more for me, when they are already more stressed than I am for my school grades (as in, they are stressed about my stress, not about my grades as much, since my grades are getting better). I do not wish to then have them rush me to an orphanage, or to the house of a widow all of a sudden. Other than what comes in the next paragraph, what can I do?\n\nThe situation in my house, Mashallah, is stable. I love and care for my parents, and same with one of my brothers (younger of the two). The other brother, middle child, I do not know about. He often goes out of his way to be annoying despite being in middle school. When I eat at home, I eat in silence. When in my room, whether working, playing video games, learning about Islam, talking to friends, anything, the only people I am in with barging in without permission, is my parents who birthed me and made the house. My brother likes to go out of his way to keep talking nonsense during eating, barging into my room, and overall trying to be annoying.\n\nWould making peace with this brother help my hard heart? Even if it does not, how can I do it. My brother may be annoying, but my mother ends up having to see us getting into arguments, and I do not want her having to deal our arguments.\n\nAs an update, I wrote this over the course of three school periods. I was close to tears whenever writing this, though I did not let them out. When I closed my computer to change classes (we were not doing anything of importance in the classes), the tears went away immediately. Is this a sign of the softening of my heart due to self-awareness, or not?", "Is it Haram to talk about converts disrespectfully?Basically, I have a Muslim friend whose parents are converts. I play online with him frequently. But my parents don't like that or him because they are the types who want all A+ all Honors 4.0+ GPA. Therefore, they are always yelling at me because he is a \"very bad friend\" because he \"doesn't care about studies, and has time to play video games all day, and wants me to become like that\" and therefore he \"doesn't care about praying or religion because he plays video games\" (which isn't true, for a fact). They also said so many times that \"his parents are converts so they aren't good Muslims\" and that \"I'm privileged to be in a Muslim-born family\" and that \"we know Islam better and are better Muslims than his family\". So I'm here asking, is it allowed to talk like this about other Muslims? ", "Thoughts, questions to ponder. This is long but I humbly ask that you please bear with me and read through all this, even if you disagree with everything.Asalamualaikum,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: I understand these are philosophical questions, based on my personal beliefs I already have definite answers to them, but I also believe there is always more than meets the eye and these are things that NEEDS to be discussed, especially given the current state of the Ummah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Given the fact that we know the United States has been funding Israel, meaning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Is it ok for a muslim to work there knowing the money that they pay in taxes goes to harming muslims somewhere else in the world?\n\nEdit: Start:\n\nSomething interesting, I don't know how credible this source is so if it's not good please let me know and I'll remove this bit. \n\n\"Economist tallies swelling cost of Israel to US\", December 9, 2002\n\n\"Since 1973, Israel has cost the United States about $1.6 trillion. If divided by today's population, that is more than $5,700 per person\". That was back in 2002 for 29 years. Also, I'm assuming it was tax money that went into this since everyone didn't give money to some charity or something funding them at the time.\n\nJust by doing some math that's approximately (again, in those years):\n\n280701754 people at\n\naround $196 to $197 per person per year\n\n$ 55172413793.10 a year (rounded down, more than $55 billion a year)\n\nEnd\n\nThis won't apply to just the United States, but any country which is either allied to them or funding them. Also, I guess we should keep in mind that if the funding had stopped, there is a chance that it could still be happening but lies were spread to calm the public.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Basically an add-on to the first question. I know that many of the muslim countries are in really bad shape. Even the ones that aren't being bombed to h\\*\\*\\* are riddled with corruption and fraudulent people not only in the governments but in the general population.\n\nBased on what little knowledge of world history I have, I've seen a sort of trend where, every country including the western ones were at a similar, if not worse off, position but the people had nowhere to go which is why they progressed forward. Currently, the conditions in, i don't know if i should put it in quotes, muslim countries are so bad that some people have no option but to leave. But usually, the ones that can't do anything get left behind while the ones who could, although it would require a huge struggle (Jihad?), leave and take their expertise elsewhere. I'm not trying to generalize anything here, i hope it's easy to understand.\n\nSo, my question becomes, wouldn't it be better for Muslims especially, that have the means to do something, even seemingly small, good in those countries should do so? I know it's not easy, and I honestly have no idea what is happening so far. But i'm not talking about blindly trusting charities where half the money might (might being the key word) go in some fraudulent character's pocket.\n\nIt will obviously take time, and our collective knowledge to figure out solutions but we would HAVE to work together.\n\nOh, one more thing, if anyone thinks this is entirely wrong or a waste of time I'd like to say ignore all of this but honestly, every opinion counts. I'd like to hear different sides of the story and maybe we can come up with some solution that could make some positive change. After all, nothing really matters except whatever we do is to \"save our own souls\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) This one has more to do with the media and, how we spend our days. There are lots, LOTS, of smokescreens all around the world. In Pakistan, if you watch the news literally all you hear is about the big guys who robbed all the money and what's going on in their lives. While many people have no idea what's happening in the rest of the world. Except the ones with access to the internet? I'm not really sure, but the majority (meaning the poor and lower class) have no idea and all they know about is the current PM and the guys who robbed them (who they still love btw. It reminds me of Pharaoh, Nimrood, etc, although nowhere near close to them lol, just reminds me of them). Also, I'm not only talking about Pakistan, I would assume this happens in other countries as well.\n\nAlso, speaking from experience, what I've realized is we have lots of distractions in other areas too not just the news. For example, I would hear about the Rohingya, which I haven't heard about lately so I'm not sure what's going on there, and then while worrying about it and trying to figure out what's going on and what to do, I'd get distracted by some cat video or start playing a video game and \"forget\" all about this dunya for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) I guess that last one led up to this. I'm terrified that Dajjal's world is already here, much more that he might be here himself. Of course, we're given clear hadith on the signs of his arrival but what if we're going about it wrong? Like, we're given signs that some people might see because they think on it and the majority might miss because they were waiting for it in the literal sense? I'm not trying to \"toot my own horn\" here because with Dajjal, none of us win. Hear me out, and I'm sure you can figure out what I miss.\n\na - he will have \"Kafir\" written on his forehead in arabic. What if that's a metaphorical thing? Like, I'm not sure if others have heard it being used but in the subcontinent people might say \"does it say something on my forehead?\" usually asking if it says something like \"stupid\". Obviously it doesn't say it, but I suppose it means when you see the guy, it should be obvious the person is what is \"says\" on their forehead.\n\nb - he will show you heaven but it will lead to hell, and hell that will lead to heaven. There might be different wording for this.\n\nIn Surah Qaf, I hope I'm not mistaken, Allah mentions a heaven and hell in this dunya apart from the heaven and hell in the akhira. If we think about it, there are varying levels of \"hell on earth\", the worst being those people who are afraid to send their children to go buy bread fearing they might get shot or worse on the way. The heaven on earth would be for those people who are, well, rich and can afford whatever they want and even do whatever they want. I'm talking about the dark side of things like dark web stuff, hunting people for sport type of stuff. (I'm assuming these are the extremes)\n\nNext for the varying levels:\n\nSuppose you're not happy with your life, you're working long hours. So to make up for it you get paid a lot. Many people are satisfied with that but it kind of reminds me of the \"slaves\" who built the pyramids. Work hard but were paid for their service (according to recent findings? whether that's wrong or right isn't important, the present is important).\n\nHeaven on earth, and bear with me on this one, would be where you can play video games so you get an \"artificial world\" where you can be whatever you want and do whatever you want, of course as long as it stays within the limits. It's impossible for people to transgress. If you live far from family, you can talk to them daily via video chat or whatever. You don't even have to go outside anymore for shopping, amazon delivers to your home and even come inside to leave things on the kitchen table.\n\nThe hell on earth would be, imagine you live in a small apartment that's the size of a closet. You work long hours, don't have time to spend with family. Take out the technology, video games, movies, music, even the smart phones. You would be living a life isolated from other people and slowly spiral into depression.\n\nIf you're the type that goes out with friends to restaurants and movies. As a muslim we have to be wary of our spending, earning and spending. Add to that we're not supposed to gossip, backbite, loose talk, etc. I'll leave this to the reader since I haven't gotten to the final point (I had more but this is way too long now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) I remember reading that the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam said **\u201cAt the beginning of every century Allah will send to this ummah someone who will renew its religious understanding\u201d**. Out of curiosity, I found that the start of the Islamic century (1 Muharram 1400) was on 21 November 1979.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 1979 \"**Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returns to Tehran**, Iran after nearly 15 years of exile and takes over the Iranian law enforcement, courts and government administration and Khomeini seizes power in Iran\" and I guess ever since then Iran has had trouble with...well everyone.\n\nThis last one wasn't really a question. Just something interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAllah knows best.\n\nMay He guide us to the straight path of those on whom He bestowed His favor,  not of those who have evoked His anger or gone astray.\n\nMay Allah protect and strengthen Islam and the muslims around the globe. May He help our brothers and sisters who are suffering, those who are being oppressed and wronged. May He help our brothers and sisters in Iran, and cause us all to unite and stop arguing over things which have already been made clear.", "End of My RopeI am at the end of my rope and need some practical advice from a Muslim man. I am struggling greatly with my sexual urges. I am so sick of being told how bad I am, how my needs are bad, etc. I have really come to see how marriage and sex are completely unrelated and how wrong of me it is to think I can get relief that way. I don\u2019t watch porn and I don\u2019t masturbate. \nThings I have tried.\nFasting. Did not help me. \nExercise. I train for a sport, doesn\u2019t help me with this. \nPraying. \nI am not some guy who sits around the house all day playing video games and eating Cheetos. I am in professional school, I get up at 5am every day, I study all day in the library, I work as hard as I can on myself, I pray (even at the Masjid), I am in shape.   \nI don\u2019t know if I can go another 5, 10, 15 years like this.

I believe it's very important for our imaan and, consequently, our akhira. \n\nFirst of all, [there's a video which explains it a little](https://youtu.be/s-PxWox4DgY) \n\nEdit: I'd suggest watching it first since i will try not to repeat what they said. But i feel like they aren't looking at the whole picture. \nEdit 2: the whole picture being how this all may be the source of Dajjal's power. Something i just remembered, imagine if you tried to explain the things we have today to people way back when. They'd see it as magic (insert famous quote about not being able to differentiate technology from magic). Like our smartphones are literally hunks of rock, glass, oil(plastic) etc which glow up to show us different things. And allow us to talk to people on the other side of the world (for those who don't know how they work, but if you look at history isn't that all magic was? The difference is only in knowing how to do it and not, even black magic) \n\nI hope anyone that reads this and understands will pass on the information to others and Insha'Allah we can at least try to save ourselves from one of the greatest fitnah in history, and i believe it's worse than anything else that mankind has faced. It's also inevitable, unavoidable. \n\nBefore continuing i want you to imagine the cartoons you may have seen as a child. Where someone wants something, the devil (Satan) appears with a contract, person gets what they want at the cost of their soul. \n\nWhen we look at privacy, a long time ago there was a saying \"information is power\". People went to great lengths to protect their identity, not giving away their name so easily, their address, etc. \n\nNowadays, we give it away easily and happily for some temporary enjoyment. I say temporary as in limited to this dunya. When you use some service there's usually a charge. Everything is free but at a greater cost we gladly accept. There is no privacy. \n\n*---- let's look at various aspects now. \n1) Knowing where everyone is and at what time. \n\nBefore what used to happen was, you found some land, built a hut or cottage and started living there. Only the people you told knew you were there. Fast forward to before smartphones were popular and you had, you'd buy a house from someone with blueprints approved, and stored, at the housing department of where ever you live. You'd register with the state, let the government know exactly where you live, where you work, what car you have, whatever else they ask. Already its a bit scary but ok, we give all that since we're living in their land. Thinking on that a moment you could say there's no place on earth where someone can live freely, but fine that's something we've already come to accept. \n\nNext, with the advent of the smartphones and their rising popularity AND affordability, everyone is slowly going from \"give all your information to the government of the country you live in\" to \"give all your information to a global power which you don't even know about\". Someone mentioned something about how there will be no need for governments in the future, having to do with crypto currency. Well this has to do with that too and why I'm against it. \n\nIf you look at all the sensors in your phone, they can determine the location, position, acceleration, etc. All on something we keep on us at all times. I'm not even going to start on smart watches, smart cars (i guess we're not really there yet) and more. \n\nThanks to the device in your pocket, there's a constant stream of information that goes to Google (android users) or Apple. The information includes a time stamp and what you were doing at that moment. If you were sitting, standing, when you got in a car, where you drove to, when you got out. If you were cycling, walking, running, on a train, a plane, etc. For anyone that thinks this isn't possible, believe me it's very possible and it exists. \n\nWith all that said, it also would NOT be hard at all to figure out where you were and who you met with. \n\n*---- \n2) Identification \n\nSimple task really. We have things like image recognition and you have a camera constantly pointed at your face. Not to mention all the selfies linked with our social media accounts, or images we're tagged in by friends. \n\nWe quickly gave away our fingerprints, which by the way if anyone remembers is a big nono. \n\nWith facial recognition we gave away shots from various angles necessary for quick recognition. \n\nVoice recognition. \n\nThings like, identification through our gestures. Meaning, how you use the apps on your touchscreen devices. Apps, keyboards, etc \n\nI think this much should be enough to understand. \n\n*---- \n3) Knowing what you like and dislike \n\nFirst of all, the simplest example for this could be things like Facebook where we literally click on like. Then things like YouTube where similar material is presented for us, and if you notice the content gets worse and worse from an Islamic perspective. That's besides the point about the time we spent/wasted on these sites as was mentioned in the video. \n\nThen there are more complex things. For example, if you understand (1), there's the location history all of us probably already know about. So which places you went to the most. Do you usually go for coffee, or burgers, fried foods, Chinese, etc, etc. \n\nIt WAS just that general information. The next thing is HOW and where you spend your money. Let's take a quick look at spending history. We had hard money, paper, gold, whatever. You buy and spend and no one knows how much you spent, where you spent, how you spent, etc. \n\nNext we moved up to checks. Leave a paper trail. So now, it was time consuming but eventually you can figure out what you need to figure out. Skip ahead even further to credit cards. Which, first of all made you spend money you don't have (according to scholars it's haram but I'm 100% people will disagree), and paying it back with interest (i think any Muslim would agree this is definitely haram). But most of all, it kept a more detailed record of spending. Now if you buy a chocolate bar we get it on credit. \n\nAnywho, that information is still \"kind of\" hard to get, so now we have things like PayPal, android wallet, whatever other wallets, cryptocurrency, and more. Which will keep detailed information of spending habits and is much easier to go through. When i say much easier I'm not talking about hackers, I'm talking about the people we sold our privacy to. Going with the flow of this post, Dajjal's people. \n\n*---- \n4) Knowing what is in your heart. \n\nAny Muslim with even the slightest bit of Islamic knowledge will IMMEDIATELY say \"Only Allah knows what is in our hearts\". \n\nI'm here to tell you, that's not wrong at all. But, given you have enough information, and the context surrounding that information, it can be simulated, or estimated. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm even using the right word here to be honest. But let me explain. \n\nSo, suppose you accepted the points before this. That all that is possible and the information exists. Now bring all of it together PLUS something i will mention shortly. \n\nAs you all know, we have multiple histories. There's the history of each and every second of our lives recorded by the angels in the books. As muslims we accept that and believe that. Then there's the other histories that only exist for the time we've been using these devices. Location history (where you've been and at what time), browsing history (I'm assuming everyone knows about this for... various reasons), then there's (VERY IMPORTANT) Search History. \n\nFor android, Google chrome, other Google service users you can view all your information when you go to the my activities page (by the way, even if you delete it all and it says it's all deleted you'll have to guess again. They have write only servers. As the name suggests, once something is written to them it can't be deleted. Also explains why so much land is bought simply for the servers/databases). \n\nAnywho, so put all the things together and we have a sort of... play by play on your life. The best part is it doesn't matter if you leave your device(s) at home either because if you know data science and all that you can use the information from other people's devices to figure out when you (the deviceless) person were in an area, at what time, etc. Add to that the cctv cameras everywhere. \n\nExample: (imagine it's all in chronological order since i already said there are time stamps to everything)\n\nPerson A got in his car. \nDrove 10 miles to a coffee shop. \nMet person B at the coffee shop. \nOrdered a large coffee with a donut, person B got an espresso. \nPerson A searched \"why is it spelled bologna\" \nPerson A searched \"how to ride a bicycle\" \nPerson A searched \"is it haram to eat a hamburger\" \nPerson A searched \"it dating haram\" \nPerson A got in their car and went back home. \nPerson A searched... Etc etc. \n\nBased on the above, you can probably guess what A and B talked about, or something they planned. \n\nAdd to that, B is a female. A and B go for a movie at 9pm on the weekend and now you change your guess. \nAdd to that person A and B meet up again and go cycling the next week and later stop at a burger shop. \n\nAnywho, this is to give a basic example. But we've added so many other surveillance systems, for example, things like Google home, Amazon Alexa, Siri. So there's a mic on us at all times. \n\nPlus, our texts and calls on services like WhatsApp. I'll tell you it's ALOT easier to sift through millions of voice calls made over the Internet than it is over the traditional systems which are slowly being replaced for better quality service. Voice over LTE. \n\nAnyway, I'm sorry i wasn't able to get to the video games and the information that is being gathered through those at the moment due to the length of this post. InshAllah I will do so one day, doesn't matter what the reaction to this post is. Every time i read the Qur'an i panic especially when it comes to keeping my mouth shut. I will keep saying this to whoever i can. Everyone be careful what you do in the \"virtual\" world. We will be held accountable before our Lord. But before that time comes, if and when Dajjal arrives this information WILL be used against us. The way it seems we're currently in the testing phase but, unfortunately for us, it seems like the time until its all perfected is close. And, also unfortunate, it can't be stopped. Even if people begin to understand it now it's already too late. \n\nMay Allah protect us all from this fitnah, may Allah protect us all, may Allah protect us all. \n\nFinal note: i know these things made life easier. But as muslims there are a few things we need to understand. This Dunya was never meant to be easy, not now, not ever. Look at the time of our Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam. He used to live in a tiny home and sleep on a mat that left impressions on his skin. He tried to explain this life is just the journey, not the final destination. \nIf that's not enough, we've traded luxury and handed over control AND power to others. When something bad happens in front of us, we expect others to deal with it and just look on \"hating it with our hearts\" which according to a hadith is \"the weakest level of imaan\", the strongest being you \"rectify it with your hands\", the second \"with your tongue\". \nThings in this world are going to s*** and WE let it get there and continue to let it get worse and worse. \n\nThat reminds me of another thing I'd like to share my thoughts on too Insha'Allah. Reddit itself is one of the greatest examples of Dajjal and his world. Yes i still use it but I'm trying to limit myself to Islamic subs and my end goal before starting was only to reach these messages. I'm glad and thank Allah for allowing me to learn more about Islam on the way, and I'm also very thankful for the opportunity to be able to help even one person. \n\nI don't want anything from anyone, i don't even want upvotes. Just that people should read through this, think on anything that calls out to them. And then if they want to discuss it then by all means, I'm not saying I'm perfectly right. Maybe i can learn from you too, after all IF it is related to dajjal then learning more is the only way to save ourselves. I don't have time to argue aimlessly though. ", "\"What do Muslims think about...?\" Essay Suggestions?EDIT: It looks like I phrased this question badly: I meant What do Muslims think about *topicXYZ*?\n\nHello! The final exam for my Intro to World Religions Class is an essay titled \"What do Muslims think about _?\" \n\nSuggested topics in the instructions for the paper include:\n-academic majors (nursing, journalism, business)\n-an interest of yours (college football/soccer/home decorating)\n-a campus organization (sororities/fraternities)\n-a hobby (playing video games)\n-personal relationships (do Muslim parents really have to approve of their son/daughter's romantic partners?)\n\nI've got some ideas, but I thought it would be fun to see what Redditors come up with as topics! I also have an etiquette question- is it inappropriate to ask my Muslim friend for suggestions?", "Why don't you want to be a superhero?Bismillah,\n\nIf you look at children today and who they look up to, you'll find majority of them talk about superheroes that they like. They all have their favourite superhero. They play with action figures, video games, put up posters, watch all the movies and cartoons and even wear clothes with their superheros on it. \n\nYou don't even have to be a child to have a favourite superhero. Ask adults who they like the most and they will give you a character they connect with. Adults try to be more deep and say \"I'd be superhero X because I use the power to benefit mankind this way or that\" or what ever justification they feel is convincing. The truth is that they are all imaginary and we know this is true.\n\nWhen humanity was at it's darkest and light of truth was at its dimmest, Allah(swt) chose to revive it by sending the Prophet(saw). While we could talk about the Prophet(saw) as a role model, a hero, a superhero, we accept that he was protected and given miracles by Allah(swt). What amazes me though, is what the Prophet(saw) instilled in the people around him, the Sahaba(ra).\n\nThe Sahaba(ra), individuals considered the weak, poor and outsiders of society, people we ourselves can relate to. People with no apparent value or ability came into contact and accepted the message brought by the Prophet(saw). From the outside, they were the same individuals, but underneath, that heart went through a total transformation. Put them on the unbearably hot desert sand, with a huge rock on their chest, their hearts remained unbreakable. Whip them until very little skin is left on their backs, junks torn out of their flesh but their hearts remained unbreakable.  \n\nWhen they were faced with an army of a 1000 well equipped men, outnumbered 3:1, instead of retreating, their hearts shone bright. [Sa'd b. 'Ubada(ra)](https://sunnah.com/urn/243940) is reported to have said to the Prophet(sa) \"By God in Whose control is my life, if you order us to plunge our horses into the sea, we would do so\". When they were on their backs, dying of thirst, even then their hearts didn't waver, preferring others over themselves.  \n\nAllah(swt) took them from regular people, to real heroes and made them the very foundation we are standing on. Heroes because when the going got tough, they didn't ditch Allah(swt). When society was against the Prophet(saw) and everything he brought they never left his side and protected him in every way. They loved him(saw) so much the Sunnah was their badge of love, even after he(saw) passed away. \n\nIf we compare ourselves to them, what was different? If we think about it, the very same Allah(swt) is still here, the Quran is still here, the Sunnah has been preserved for us, so what is different? The hearts are different. Their hearts were so firm on Allah(swt) that they would increase their nafl Salah, yet we can barely pray our Fardh salah and think we are ok. They wouldn't give up even the smallest Sunnah for anyone, we on the other hand are so afraid of the looks we get, we shed them all. \n\nThe Sahaba(ra) wanted to and made the effort to act like the Prophet(saw), look like the Prophet(saw), walk like the Prophet(saw), be like the Prophet(saw) in every way. We on the other hand make the effort to be nothing like him, then how can we become heroes? The real question we should all be asking, why don't we want to be heroes? Why don't we want to be like the Sahaba(ra), the best of this Ummah, superheroes? \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "What To Do in Free TimeWinter break is coming up and I don't want to waste it all playing video games.

These are not truths. These ideas are presented to spur thought in you! I have no qualifications to quote any Quran or Hadith and I don't give myself such agency. These are just thoughts that I had in the moment and I had to put them to paper. If you try to look for faults in this piece of writing, you are sure to find many because I am only human. This is just a piece of my journey that I hope to relay in order to benefit someone. Jzk.\n\nIt exists, and I have experienced it. Not with these eyes though. Allah's unseen world is real. We all know this in theory to be true, but how many of us have actually tapped into its powers?\n\nThere is one point I want to hammer home. This is the basis of my entire message here: Everything Allah tells us to do, or not do, or does to us is for a REASON. NOTHING happens by accident. To those who don't think and ponder, everything is random chaos. But to those who do think and ponder, keep reading.\n\nWith that being said, I would like to discuss sins. Allah doesn't arbitrarily say \"don't do x, y or z\". Sure, there's things out there we have no clue why they end up being haram (music is a great example I like to explain. A lot of people think its because of the bad lyrics. Let me tell you. The foul language in the music is the least of why its haram. How do I know this? I've experienced the lack of music.) You see, Allah can neither be harmed not benefited. He is already perfect. Complete. Whole. He is immune to harm. Allah does not gain or lose anything by restricting us from stuff. You follow? Good.\n\nNow that I have established this idea, lets dig deeper. Let me take you on a thought exercise. Calm you mind, body and soul right now. Take some deep breaths & focus on the words you are about to read. Have full trust in me to take you on this journey. Ready? Go.\n\nUsing the idea I illustrated above, consider the following: I present to you two people. Person A and Person B. Person A stubs their toe & yells out a swear word. Person B commits shirk (aoothubillah). The first thing that comes to mind is, whoa. Shirk is way worse. But you see, the effect of both sins on Allah is EXACTLY the same. He can't be harmed or benefited, remember? The reason sins have rankings is because of the effect they have on US, NOT HIM. Boom. My mind was blown when I figured this out.\n\nThis got me wondering, why is shirk the biggest sin though? How badly does it harm us that Allah ranked it as #1? There are no apparent physical or emotional detriments. I don't see dudes dropping on the regular due to broken backs from doing sujood to a statue of Zeus. People have billions in the bank, worshiping grass & they'll be totally happy. I think its because shirk kills us spiritually. This is the worst harm that can touch us, because while our bodies will perish, the soul is eternal.\n\nLA ILAHA ILALLAH, MUHAMMADUR RASULULLAH - Commonly translated as \"there is no god except Allah\" - but wait. That means there is no god except god. It makes sense, but not entirely. You see, our declaration of faith actually states - There is no ILAH except Allah. As sister Yasmin Mogahed clarifies, an Ilah is something we put at the very center of our soul. All our dreams, hopes & aspirations are in this one thing. If money is all I think of from the moment I wake up to when I go to bed. This is worship. Do you have a husband, wife, bf or gf in that spot? Tear them out of that spot. Shirk on any level shatters the human soul like no other tragedy could. This is the natural order of the universe. When any creation of Allah places their need in something else that is created, it is imperfect & temporary. By definition this is anything other than Allah. This is the biggest harm to us! In his perfect knowledge, wisdom & mercy he knows this, that's why he says its the number one sin. It's for our protection.\n\nThe unseen world holds precedence over the physical world. But we must learn to balance both. That is the real world. This world is an illusion. Most people know this in theory, but they don't \\*get\\* it. To \\*get\\* it truly is to see it with those eyes. Not your physical eyes. Go up to your bedroom wall and try to put your hand through it. Unless your name is Kyle and you live with your stepdad and drink 3 red bulls a day & you haven't already punched a hole in the drywall, then probably not. Does that mean the wall is real? Absolutely not. It our shortsighteness, we use our body, (which is also an illusion) as a measuring stick for the other illusions around us. Our bodies are temporary. Just like everything we see around us. We think this world is real because we can see, feel, taste and smell. Those sensations FEEL SO REAL. Just like when you're in a dream. It feels so real, but its not. And it only lasts a few seconds. This idea, along with our idea of \"sin rankings\" in place. I'd like to delve deeper into how all this stuff like porn & music is haram with a capital H.\n\nI hold the opinion that the world of Allah cannot be translated. It can only be explained. At best, translation is an approximation of what Allah may be saying. With some flaws. We miss the layers of context, syntax, nuance, grammatical precision, miraculous linguistic discourse and all the other stuff that makes Quran the miracle that it is. In translating, we discount the word of Allah & reduce its valuation to something it was never meant to be.\n\n\"Saba Samawat\" is lazily translated as \"seven heavens\" or \"seven skies\". Allah is never deficient in his use of language. Even beyond that, he is lazer precise & perfect in the way he does things. If he had meant seven heavens he would have said saba janaat, right? Even for skies there are many words in arabic. A theory in the works of the teacher of my [beloved teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww4yRtUxLrw) is that sama (singular of samawat) is a strata. A world of space and time. Parallel to us, layered on top of one another. This theory could easily be wrong though. Regardless of what samawat actually means, my point still stands. The intention of me presenting this example is to spur thought in you. Not claim some esoteric truth. We know that different dimensions of space and time exist. Allah teaches this in many different places in the Quran. Let me present other random examples. There are two angels sitting sitting on your shoulders right now. At this moment. They see everything you do. But you can't see them or interact with them. But they exist HERE. They're just in a different dimension of space & time. Have you ever taken a 3 hour nap and it feels like 20 minutes? Bingo. Your soul enters a different dimension of time when you sleep. What does all this have to do with Halal & Haram. Ill explain.\n\nOur soul lives in this unseen world. When we sin, we tap into this unseen world & stab our soul, harming it. Shoveling filth on it. Blinding it to the natural order of the universe. Upon doing so, our spirit becomes weaker. Everything gives off a vibrational energy or resonance. This level of energy determines how strongly we connect with Allah. It also has other cool applications. I can pick up someone's vibe now. A girl could be a 10/10 but if I catch a bad vibe she's a 3/10. I remember mentioning this in my last post. Just like between Musa (AS) & Khidr, you see things for what they REALLY are. Not just what they appear to be. There is a REASON we recite the first 10 ayat of sura Kahf for protection against Dajjal. Remember. For those who think and ponder, Allah does EVERYTHING for a REASON. He is not arbitrary or random. Dajjal will come during the end times. So it is logically sound to conclude that the content of sura Kahf is relevant to the end times. The disparity between appearance and reality is more prevalent today than ever. You probably see that beautiful woman, she can get any man she wants, shes successful in her career & she builds wells in Africa. That is her APPEARANCE. The instagram life. Behind the scenes, she is popping loads of medication to cling to life, depressed and miserable.\n\n\\*\\*DISCLAIMER\\*\\* Do not believe what I say. These are not truths. These ideas are presented to spur thought in you!\n\nAnother example I'd like to give you is the entry of the masjid with the right foot. An underrated sunnah. Have you ever thought WHY though? Environments carry unseen energies. The right side of our body is a receptor. When we enter the masjid, we receive the positive energy from it. Look into Chinese traditions and principles of energy to learn more. When we exit we use the left foot so we can retain that energy. The vibrational energy of masaajid are high because the remembrance of Allah takes place. This vibration must be kept pure, that is maybe why it is discouraged to talk about worldly matters inside the masjid. Think about it. If I whisper to you about my pet cat inside the masjid, it doesn't harm anyone, right? But its discouraged because of the effect it has on the average unseen energy of that environment. They are commandments & sunnah for a REASON but sadly we've lost our capacity to think. Now, I know we don't need to know why Allah asks us to do these things. We hear and we obey. But Allah also commands us to think. He constantly rheorically asks us \"why don't you think?\" Everything he tells us to do or not do to has a reason & I think its productive to ponder on these reasons. I fully trust Allah and I will do what he asks me regardless of if I understand it or not. I just like to think.\n\nIf your soul is muddied by sin, when you tap into that world, the collection of power/recharging process will be really inefficient. You'll maybe get a drop or two. It's kinda like going on an easter egg hunt while you're tied and gagged in the back of someone's car. You're not getting any chocolate. The first step is to free yourself.\n\nSins harm US, remember. When we backbite, it lowers our vibrational energy. Think about it. If I backbite and that smack talk dies inside the room, it technically doesn't harm anyone physically or emotionally. No one will know what I told my friend about Becky. Same with swearing, if I say a swear word even in a joking way it doesn't harm anyone, but its still a sin. Why? It affects that unseen energy of yours. [Positive and negative words have an unseen energy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwHMNN7Z8JI) You can probably do your own research on this too. Cut these out as much as you can. Social media and video games are not haram, but when you misuse them to disrespect time, your vibes go down. -150 points. Now you're at 500 instead of 650. With 500 instead of 650, EVERYTHING YOU DO IN LIFE IS LESS EFFICIENT, even going to the gym. Less energy = less gains.\n\nLies are bad. Music drops your energy like you won't believe. I have a whole theory on this but its too long to get into now. People say it actually makes them feel energized & alive, and it does! But this is shaitans trick! He promises you +10 energy and vitality in the physical world and trades it for 500 points in your spirit realm! I'm not just making this up. I've FELT this by quitting music.\n\nPorn? Forget about it. This level of fahsha will have your soul clinging to life in the ICU on a respirator. You're not getting any chocolate on that easter egg hunt. You're not even a part of it. EVEN if you use it once a month or a week. Shaitan will try to rationalize with you & tell you that you're not addicted. Dw homie, its not that bad. Btw, you're not married, so you need some form of release, right? At least I'm not committing Zina. The list goes on. He's offering you +50 zina energy in exchange for -1000 spirit energy. Fahsha kills the soul like nothing else. STDs and other consequences exist in the physical world, but trust. That's nothing compared to what you lose of your soul. If you're in this state DONT LOSE HOPE IN ALLAH. HE RESTORES THE DEAD HEART BACK TO LIFE LIKE HE BRINGS LIFE TO THE DEAD EARTH PRODUCING VEGETATION. YOUR STORY DOESN'T END HERE. PICK YOURSELF UP.\n\nAll your energy originates from the soul. It strengthens your emotion and this emotion motivates your physical actions. Have you ever seen the fat kid that gets bullied and grows up to be a bodybuilder? What kept him in the gym motivated and ready to go? Its his emotion that was in the driver's seat. That pain of being bullied. We see these Cinderella stories all the time. They tug at your heartstrings and make you cry. The root of that is strong emotion. Want to strengthen this emotion? Tap into the source of that emotion & connect with Allah.\n\nToday, I feel like I could punch through a brick wall. I wrote this entire thing after rolling around in bed after Fajr because I couldn't go back to sleep. The old me would have probably looked up a few videos after not waking up for Fajr. I get it now. When I make Salah its more efficient than before. Instead of coming back with nothing, or drops, I feel like I come back with a cup full of spiritual energy, not just a drop. I remember listening to a Duncan Trussel podcast titled - \" Meditation is more important than your job \". This man got it. It reminded me of Salah and how its the most important thing in a Muslim's life. The difference between the meditative state they attain is that they're using an imperfect method. Allah has given us the perfect activity to worship him, in turn benefiting us. I think this spiritual energy converts into emotional energy and then that emotion converts into physical energy. Through transmutation. Have you ever heard of the stories of those great Muslims in the past who ate 3 dates a day and wrote 10 books in the same day? Have you heard of Buddhist monks who do some crazy stuff? They don't have to grit their teeth because they're so hungry and want food so bad. They just don't need it. I get it now. We have the perfected method of connecting with Allah on this planet and polishing our soul. In his mercy, he gave this to us as a gift. And he made it mandatory on us so we can't ignore the gift even if we wanted to. This is also why we fast I think. Low dopamine in the physical world means the body is weak and deprived. In order to balance things out, out soul awakens & eats up whatever it can get it's hands on. The transmission is more efficient. We enable this gateway by fasting.\n\nGuys. We all have access to this \"hidden\" world. Its in plain sight and we don't need to do anything extraordinary to get there. We just have to give up a bunch of our sins. Transformation cannot occur unless we change what is in ourselves first. We have access to the exact same mercy of Allah the people of the cave in sura Kahf. How do I know this? Allah doesn't change, hes constant. People change. We just disqualify ourselves from it through our actions. We don't believe hard enough. People think this stuff is only for really pious people and big scholars. I don't even pray all night. I just do my 5 and a bit extra. When its time to perform, I walk the walk. I don't check out that pretty girl. Man its hard at times but I pretend like I'm fulfilling the legacy of Yusuf (AS) when he taught us how to handle that stuff. Don't backbite. Little things like that. I am proof of this phenomenon. He gave us arms, legs, a brain, a soul, we have all the tools! If we just listened to him and did what he asked with those tools, we have access.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking we can never get to the level of the great Muslims of the past, but if you try to even get close to that, you'll experience a fill like nothing else. You free yourself from the need of \"created\" things. I feel FULL. Not just superficially. I feel a TRUE FILL. Now I want to give, give , give all the time to everyone because I'm full. I'm overflowing. Its not about what I can take anymore. Next week inshallah I'm going to ask for that prayer spot at work. I'm a regular person just like you. I'm not special at all. I raised this \"energy\" by shedding off sins and doing more good deeds. I see the illusion of this world now. I felt the true fill and I'm chasing the pleasure of Allah now.\n\nTHIS. IS. SOME. NEXT. LEVEL. STUFF.\n\nImagine nobody on this planet knew what exercise was and all of a sudden someone comes along and says, \"Omg. Guys. I did this thing where I moved my legs really fast. It was like walking, but faster. I'm going to call it \"jogging\". It's amazing and I got so much energy and my body changed incredible ways this is some secret of the universe! It sucked and it was really painful at first but it's something everyone should be doing!\n\nI feel like I discovered some super drug without any side effects and everyone needs to know. Do yourself a favor. Discover it for yourself. Please. The difference between the two ways is literally life and death. Notice how I used the word literally there. The heart literally dies when its not connected to Allah. Allah is the one who gives life to the dead heart. Just like he gives life to the dead land and produces vegetation. You'll know exactly what I'm talking about once you try it. You'll go 5 months or more without any \\*noticeable\\* results. You'll actually be sadder because you have no dopamine. The body is being starved so the soul can be revived. But if you grit your teeth and get past the hard part, you'll hit transcendence. You won't want to go back. Keep going with faith and trust in Allah 's plan.\n\nAll I asked Allah was for him to help me quit porn but he gave me so much more than I could imagine. I didn't even have the intention to quit music or video games. I was already off social media for the most part. Don't do this to chase some spiritual high or secret energy. All that stuff is just a byproduct. Remember that your intention has to be straight or your actions are useless. Do it for Allah. The rest are just perks. Icing on the cake.\n\nTo the people who already have been down my path and are ahead of me. Send me your knowledge and insight, I want to know how to harness this power and manage it correctly. Iblees got up pretty high and fell really hard. I have to constantly check my emotions and go back to the drawing board.", "Rabbil 'Alameen - Fictional worldsAsalamualaikum everyone,\n\nI've had an interest in trying to understand the end times, and the fitna that would come with it, dajjal, etc.\n\nI won't go into the other things, my main concern for this post is related to shirk, and mainly to put forth an idea.\n\nThere are a few things to consider, I'll list them out:\n\n1) Video games\n\n2) Movies\n\n3) TV shows\n\n4) Story books, novels, short stories, comics, etc\n\n5) Our thoughts in general, I suppose mainly day dreaming and dreams as well\n\nI know video games didn't exist during the time of the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam, or movies, tv, etc. I'm not sure if they had story books at that time, or even if they did, if the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam, or any of the Sahaba, read them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe question, as you've probably already figured out, when we say \"Al-hamdu Lil-lahi Rabbil 'Alameen\" (Surah Fatiha), does it apply to these as well?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll give a few examples of what I mean, afterwards I'll give my explanation:\n\n1) Dungeons and Dragons is getting a lot of attention nowadays. It's where you take the role of a character and have to choose a religion (Islam not being on the list), multiple religions, multiple gods and goddesses. \n\n2) On a similar note, many video games that have religions, none of them from the real world. As far as I know you don't have to choose any here. One example I can give for that is Elder Scrolls, Skyrim. Or Dark Souls.\n\n3) Now, for Movies and TV shows I don't really know a lot but for the sake of argument I'm talking about fantasy ones like Game of Thrones which is pretty popular I suppose. \n\n4) In books there are lots of examples, of course mainly fantasy ones. Although I guess religion isn't brought up in a lot of them.\n\n5) Our thoughts themselves. Lets ignore the factor, for now, that they are influenced by the video games, books, movies, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe first thing is obvious, fan bases always take things too far. For example, in Dark Souls one of the things the characters say is \"praise the sun\", and the fans would repeat this in real life too. The same goes for literally everything else.\n\nI was reading a while back, in the Qur'an, about how the kafir would worship the idols and when they were told the idols could do nothing for them they said it was what their forefathers did so they did it too, and they knew the idols couldn't do anything to help them. Similarly, when the kafir were told they would be resurrected after death they doubted it and asked how they would be brought back after their bones turned to dust. So putting the things together, some of the kafir had atheistic beliefs and the idol worship may have been more of a cultural thing rather than actual belief. Just like we might say, to mimic dark souls, \"praise the sun\" and say \"obviously i'm not praising the sun, its a dark souls reference\".\n\nBy the way, this issue isn't just with fantasy religions but past pagan religions that are making a comeback. Like after the show on the vikings, plus movies like Marvel's Avengers showing thor and the other norse gods (the super heroes, meaning batman, superman, spiderman, and all the others, are an issue too) people started saying things like \"for valhalla\" and whatever else, even if they're just joking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry, I started going off topic there. This is actually a question and a statement. Does \"Rabbil 'Alameen\" apply to these fictional worlds as well? I personally believe it does; That in a fantasy setting (entirely made up) whether the author mentions it or not, whether we want to believe it or not, Allah is the Rabb of all the worlds and Islam shouldn't be forgotten. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason I ask this as a sort of question too is to hear what people with knowledge have to say on it. But until I receive clear evidence going against it, I believe this 100%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease excuse any spelling and grammatical mistakes.", "Ludo is a board game where you roll a couple of dices. does it mean we should refrain from playing Ludo?", "is it haram to play a game which contains a cross?for example in chess the king has a cross-like thing on it.

They seem to have the story of trying to fight back oppressors but they use a fictional \"god\" as the oppressor/oppressing idea and so it feels more like an atheist or nihilist message, etc?\n\nAll the characters, deities, etc in these games tend to be fictional with fictional names and characteristics so I was thinking to deal with it this way as a \"work of fiction\" and just focus on combat and gameplay but I'm not sure if even as a work of fiction with characters and fictional \"gods\" not related to real world , would it still be haram to play these games?\n\nWarning: spoilers for both games ahead and more importantly, very possibly triggering/annoying content for muslims and any believers in God in general.

Basically, when you're starting the game and in the first cutscene, the main character 2B is thinking to herself saying something like \"If I knew the god who made us like this, I'd kill him\" -astaghfar Allah- but on reading more about the subject to understand if they were really that bold to just say such statement right away like that in a game, I find out that this also a fictional \"god\" the robots made up because, the first/oldest robot of them refused to believe the humans made them and went crazy and decided to make their own android \"god\" so that fictional character is what 2B is referring to at first. I still don't feel comfortable and not sure if this makes playing this game haram as well eventhough knowing its a fictional made up non real \"god\" they're referring to? The concept itself Idk.!<\n\nWhat's your thoughts on this, friends? Does that make these 2 games haram to play or not?", "Ask anything to a Muslim that is losing their faith.Hello all! I'm not sure if I am still on the fold of Islam, since I have a book worth of questions and doubts on the faith, but I surely haven't left it with intent (as in having proclaimed disbelief and/or disbelieved in the possibility and/or probability of Islam as the religion of truth).\n\nI'll start this by saying I've been binge studying Islam ever since I reverted. Whenever I've got some free time, I go and watch a lecture on the analysis of some surah, or some aspect of faith. I've done my reading, and am by no means a total beginner in faith. I am nowhere close being as knowledgeable as many of you, but certainly not as novice as many others.\n\nI'll start with some background, maybe this can help and you guys will be easier on me. This is, of course, a throwaway account, after all I don't want my friends to figure I'm having all these questions and doubts. I've always been an extremely rational and skeptic with whichever beliefs I hold, and when I started getting into more advanced topics of my interest (mathematics, physics and computer science), I've really grasped the importance of critical thinking, the employment of reason, and what claiming proof of something truly entails.\n\nI crossed all types of religions. From Buddhism to Occultism, and pretty much every mainstream faith there is. I never adhered to any of them in particular, with the exception of Buddhism, which I found was absolutely nonsensical, but had an amazing culture with seemingly infinite history and depth. Ultimately, I've always considered myself an atheist, and that was exactly what I was before reverting.\n\nI reverted in the beginning of the last year, and Islam truly brought me comfort, at least at first. I was absolutely fascinated about how such complex and beautiful things could be deduced merely by analyzing the Qur'an and the authentic Ahadith. I was mesmerized when presented evidence of the prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), and found them more than sufficient.\n\nFor some months, I've tried to improve my faith, to become a better Muslim. I started praying all the five Fara'id prayers, tried doing as many sunnah prayers I could, tried to incorporate the sunnah in my life, read the Qur'an, memorized a couple surahs and was ultimately happy with my situation.\n\nThat was until I started getting back into studying mathematics. I dove into formal languages, propositional logic, revisiting many topics that I've always held dear in my heart. And, as seemingly random as it sounds, I said to myself; \"Ok, I'll take my head out of the water and take a good look at my faith. I know for a fact Islam is the true religion, but I'm interested in how it is from an external perspective\". And just like that, doubts started do pile up. I'd just shut myself up and try to seek explanations, all of which never really answered my questions.\n\nThis, of course, led to no good. And at this point I'm even questioning if I'm still on the fold of Islam. I started questioning miracles, the prophethood, the scriptures, the beliefs, pretty much everything. I used to consider myself quite firm on faith until that point, but now it's all crumbling and I'm holding the deen by the fingernails.\n\nI feel I only believe in Allah for the fear that He might exist. It's almost like a haunting certainty, always creeping around, and no matter how much I try to feel any other thing towards Him, all I can feel is fear. Paralyzing, primal, **real** fear.\n\nBut still, somewhere around my wits, the thoughts roam; \"What if I actually could have listened to Beethoven sometimes?\", \"What if I could have played chess, and games\"?\n\nI swear by Allah that there is no foul intention in my heart, and that I'm completely honest when it comes to my faith, and me losing it.\n\nI hope to get some questions. Ask someone who is probably already doomed anything.", "Would it be disrespectful to use a hijab as part of a cosplay when I am not Muslim?I am a non-muslim cosplayer who would really like to cosplay the character Sable from the videogame of the same name.

Any advice? Anything helps :)Assalamualikum. 16M\n\nSo, all my life, I've always been having problems with my parents. We almost can never come to an agreement about my life, and we often argue a lot. My parents are kind of close-minded narcissists, very stubborn, always want things to go their way without thinking of how it can affect me mentally/emotionally, and if there is even a slight problem, my mother yells at the top of her lungs, saying that I should listen to her, and that I'll get sin if I don't, and if I still refuse, she starts to cry, and my father starts to get physical, all over a small petty thing. I've always found academic school easy from a young age and I still do, but my parents forcefully put me in a Islamic school to memorize quran, alam course, and do academic school online, which wasn't easy for me. I've always tried my hardest, studied day and night, took tons of notes, very attentive in class, prayed 5 times a day, made dua, and only slept for 3-4 hours at night. But I never got good grades and always struggled. I've told them this, and they say that I'm lying and that it's because I play games all day, but I don't even have any gaming devices, or a phone. Just a laptop to do my school. So when I deny, they get mad. Soon the work was overwhelming me, I started to get depressed, and my anxiety skyrocketed during class because some teachers would target me with all the questions, bully and embarrass me If I didn't know. I tried telling my parents, but they never cared, and said I just need to study harder. And also because of them, I dont have any close friends, and I never did in my life. I was always alone  and ended up turning to the internet to make friends and praying to Allah when I felt lonely. Since most of my friends that I made were online, I'd spend some time texting them every now and then, and these people are such nice and wholesome people that has helped me through a lot, but my parents say that I chat all day and that all my friends are bad people and that they all are having a bad influence on me, but they are the whole reason I've still able to keep my sanity. I've hated my parents wholeheartedly for the past 3 years but never told them, and made plans to separate and run away from them as soon as I became 18. But the more I thought about it, the more I came to the understanding that, without parents, its not possible gain the happiness of Allah, and enter Jannah. But I also couldn't live up to their expectations. I even made dua for them after every salaah, hoping things would get better. But today when my mom was yelling at me like she usually does, for being a spoiled kid, not studying enough, not listening to them and such, I don't know what came over me because Im pretty self-aware, calm, and quiet, but suddenly I just felt like had enough, and burst yelling that I hated them, and that I wished that they could just understand which they never do, and if they could just stop yelling like an animal all the time. My mom seemed so surprised, started crying, called me a \"be'adab\", said that she wished I was never born as her son, and wished that she killed me at a young age with poison, and said that she puts her \"ba'dua\"(Curse) on me that I never get anywhere in life. I feel scared. I don't know what to do. I'm not even the slightest bit close with them, so I can't even bring myself to ask for forgiveness, but I do plan to do so within some time, so aside from that, is there anything I can do to make things better between them and I?

It's, therefore,* ***Haram***(Forbidden).\"\n\nAnd with how our religion believes in concepts of prevention not so much as cures, the notion of risk is very looked down upon. Especially with the apparent yet understandable disdain toward gambling, dice, and other events where \"*luck*\" is involved. Islam despises \"*luck*\" or the notion of \"*risking*\" rather explicitly so.\n\nThus making me feel almost obliged to throw that \"*talent*\" for writing away. Just like the many talents I've thrown away for the sake of Allah like drawing characters and music. Each one leaves me more frustrated than the last. You could tell me to write \"*non-fiction*\" but I have, and that isn't really \"*creative work*\".\n\nYou don't need to remind me of the notion that whoever leaves something bad for the sake of Allah, Allah will reward him with something better than it. And personally, that isn't particularly motivating. But I'm doing it because it's for the best not for any reward, really.\n\nNow I'm even contemplating throwing away playing games in general, and once I do. I won't have much left, really. I'll resort to sports and studying, and living life as grey as possible.\n\nThis leaves me in a state of \"*dissonance*\", where I feel like I have a few empty spots in my heart/soul. Now some might say: \"*Great! Fill those wholes with the remembrance of Allah.*\"\n\nI have tried, but they aren't particularly being filled. I do a lot of ***Dhikr***(remembrance) passively, be it thinking of how everything relates to Allah, marveling at his creations, praising his perfection; or simply reciting Qur'an.\n\nNonetheless, it's frustrating really, how I have to abandon all these hours.\n\nSome people might say: \"*That's just how life is though, it's full of trials and tribulations. You'll feel truly satisfied in Paradise. Just be patient.*\"\n\nTo that, I find disdain in my heart personally speaking. How I have to \"*die*\" before I can feel satisfied with my life, and that, I can't stand it.\n\nSome of you might say I have the wrong priorities and that I should focus on the Akhira, but I want a balance. I want a good life in the Dunya and a good end in the Akhira. Call me greedy if you'd like but it isn't impossible. Some might respond that I should just change my perspectives and just accept it all as is.\n\nI don't have many desires as a whole as a person, not many at all. I don't think I particularly \"*desire*\" Paradise. I just don't want to be in Hellfire really. Paradise never felt like a reward, I don't feel like I deserve it and never will.\n\nEither way, I just feel a bit empty right about now, that is all.

So:\n\n* Doing most learning from books + paper, rather than laptops (though still ensuring IT literacy, see below) using similar strategies to The London Acorn School (a tech free school).\n\n>As they put it , this is \" to develop their creativity and imagination even while having minimal amounts of technology present.\"\n\n* Filling the house with the love + company of the family + the dkhir of Allah SWT, seeking Islamic knowledge\n* Abundance of other hobbies - board games, competitions, drawing, reading, writing, baking/cooking, story telling, knitting, treasure hunts, learning languages, playing with cats lol etc\n* Using the outdoors + learning unique crafts - adventures, risk-taking, sports/exercise, walks, hikes, games, fishing, exploring, climbing, gardening, building, etc\n\nI've thought through strategies of exposure so that tech isn't a \"forbidden fruit\" and they don't get addicted when they're older inshallah. E.g:\n\n* Letting the children pick documentaries/Islamic lectures to watch using a laptop, TV and a smartphone\n* Occasional supervised usage of a family PC with restricted websites for study/work to ensure they gain IT literacy\n* Regularly talking to them about the unhealthy way that others use their devices e.g. excessive screentime, dopamine hunting between social media apps, 24/7 Netflix, actual sins etc and having them learn for themselves why it's not a good idea\n\nSome might say I'm jumping the gun as I don't have kids yet...but it's good practice to get ahead inshallah and learn from others before you're in the experience. So I'd love to hear from others on this inshallah.\n\n1. If anyone is currently raising children like this, please share your experiences! (or if you know of someone else who has)\n2. If anyone is like me and doesn't have children yet, but wants to raise children in a technology minimal way, do share your own thoughts.\n\nAlso - a big issue would be if ALL of the friends of the children still had smartphones and watched Youtube all the time etc. This would make the child feel much more restricted and marginalised, as they wouldn't be able to connect purely on non-tech based hobbies.\n\nSo if any **SISTERS** (especially in the **UK** but not exclusively!) who are either raising children like this/want to raise children like this in the future, **please DM me! We can make a group chat inshallah and connect**. This is kind of on a whim but Allah SWT makes anything possible! Perhaps our current or future children can get to know others raised in a similar manner and make friends.\n\nDisclaimer: completely get why others may choose not to focus on minimising tech actively in this way. They may feel this is too restrictive or doesn't work for them, and I understand that! I'm not at all arguing that this is a better choice, just what I'm interested in inshallah.

Confused about this one.\n\nScenario 3: \"If you win the race, I'll give you $100.\" This is like a one-way bet that if the person doesn't win the race, he doesn't lose any money.

Maybe general bars. Let's say a sports bar though. The main purpose is to provide access to sports games. So why is it haram for someone to go to one with the intent to watch one and not drink?\n\nAnd lastly, I can see why being a bar regular would be a bad idea.

It doesn't make sense to me for Muslims to segregate themselves completely from them, especially when it's not impossible to abide by their lifestyle choices since they're not being forced to drink or sit at tables where this takes place.

I am an international student in Europe living far from my parents. Im currently finishing my last year of university Alhamdullilah. I was born and raised in a fairly religious family where my parents never really forced me to practice but I just started practicing by following their example Alhamdullilah.\n\nUnfortunately, throughout my teenage years I have been facing a problem that started as a little one and today is ruining my life. It is making me anxious and depressed. Ruining every single day of mine. I have made numerous posts about It and have now accepted that seeking professional help is the ultimate and last solution for me. I don\u2019t really know why Im posting this here as I know that I should seek medical help but it is not as easy because it can be expensive and I am not sure that a non-muslim therapist could understand the context of what I deal with. I guess I am just looking for support because I am really desperate.\n\nWhere to start? I suffer and have symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in my religious acts. Whether that be Salah, Wudu, Ghusl, pretty much anything relating to my practice of Islam. I have memories of this going back to when I was 14, but back then they were mere thoughts that did not affect my life the way they do nowadays. Im currently 22 years old and every single day I am anxious because praying my five daily prayers and performing wudu is a complex process that involves a lot of rituals in order to neutralize the anxiety, for those who are familiar with the condition. \n\nI am ashamed to write this, but this condition made me stop praying for a long period of my life. The anxiety induced by the thoughts haunting me when I used to pray or performing ghouls or wudu was too much for me to handle that unfortunately the strategy that I chose was to avoid it all-together. Its been since Ramadan 2022 that I am trying to do my five daily prayers\u2026and I fairly was able to do so but with difficulties. I am ashamed to write this but I sometimes record my prayers with my smartphone in order to make sure that I wouldn\u2019t do any mistake. The doubts concern the number of Rakahs, mispronouncing my Quran verses, basically it is like my mind plays game to find one single thing that will make me doubt the validity of my prayer. The same goes with ablution where If I spend 5 mins in the bathroom I am lucky, otherwise it can take 10 mins or more. For ghusl too I spend too much water. The thoughts really haunt me and prevent me from enjoying life. During a period of my life where I did not pray, I was feeling empty and I knew I needed to pray 5 times a day to feel better, to be honest I know that my situation of today is better Alhamdullilah (praying 5 times a day more or less but while struggling a lot) but deep down I still feel so down because I feel like If my thoughts continue to be this scary and anxiety inducing, I might stop all together and go back into this depressing period where Im not praying. \n\nI know the scholars all say that we should ignore intrusive thoughts and waswas when it comes to this, even conventional medicine talks about a certain method which is called (Exposure and Response Prevention therapy) but I feel like I still need more support because all of these tactics seem to not be enough for me.\n\nFor example this issue makes me delay for no reasons my prayer because the thought pattern will make me delay it to not expose myself to scary thoughts about not doing wudu well or making a mistake in the prayer. For example If I have a small doubt about a Dhuhr prayer and I try ignoring it, I will spend the rest of the day thinking about it and feeling anxious and bad about it and thinking of myself as the worst muslim ever, (I think I also have a problem with blowing things out of proportion in my mind) I constantly dramatize everything and it fuels my anxiety even more. I don\u2019t have a healthy approach to deen. I know that believers are supposed to have a balanced approach about the mercy of Allah but for some reasons my mind prefers playing games with me.\n\nThis situation is affecting my work at university, social life, overall mood as you can see. \n\nI am aware that I said some things that can seem to be very shocking, my apologies if that is the case. \n\nIts currently 3 AM, after a stressful day I am writing this out of despair and emotion, hoping that I even make sense because OCD is not a simple condition to explain.\n\n Thank you all for any insight that could help me, May Allah bless you al.", "My friend took shahada over PlayStation AlhamdulillahWe\u2019ve been talking and gaming for a year now.

Since I was a young boy, I was fascinated by those recitations I heard and fancy Arabic letters I saw people reading from, as well as the teachings of Islam. My father was quite on the opposite side. When I got my first bilingual Quran, he promptly ordered me to return it to the library I borrowed it from, yelling at me about it being \"a meaningless book of terrorists\", as I remember his exact words. That had the exact opposite effect he tried to impose on me. The spark had grown, and I was studying Islam every single day, at every single minute of my free time.  \n\n\nI was fascinated on the completeness and wholesomeness of the Deen and the integrity of the preservation of the Quran and the Ahadith, quite as if I was born for it (which I still feel I was). As strong as my interest was, it wasn't enough. I didn't revert at that time and gradually stopped studying it and started studying occult sciences instead. I considered me an atheist at that point, meaning I didn't even believe in what most occult students would, but still, all those symbols, analogies and secrets of yore concealed behind cryptic paintings, anagrams, poems, texts and manuscripts fascinated me with such a power I had never felt. I saw virtue, and praise to the worthy and scorn to the unworthy, and that made me feel like I was on the right place. I never truly believed any of that would be actually doing anything on the outside world. I was working on my mind, quite literally changing into it to extinguish vice and fill the gaps with virtue. Me experiencing myself.  \n\n\nAfter that, I was on a growing rationalist mindset. I smirked at anything that would minimally differ from what I thought to be the scientific consensus, focusing instead on what could be proven, touched, seen and felt. I dismissed all religions and got into a spiral of arrogance and selfishness. All of that, of course, could never result into anything minimally good, and it was right then I hit the wall. I noticed I knew absolutely nothing of what I thought I knew, I saw my insignificance, my selfishness, and all my petty thoughts filled to the brim with toxic and blighted arrogance. I began to rethink my principles, all of them, I would build myself from the ground up, and there I met the Deen.  \n\n\nThe answer to all my questions, as clear as day, not hidden behind symbols, right then and there, for me and everyone else. I finally found myself. Months of studying and reading led me to take what I see as the most important event of my life. I was finally a Muslim. I memorized and meditated on the meaning of what was recited during the Salah, I learned how to read and write Arabic, I saw motivational videos made from and to fellow Muslims. It felt like heaven, except heaven will be infinitely better. I prayed, fasted, meditated on the Quran and the meaning of its verses, and it was like that for months.  \n\n\nUntil I found some things I, in my ignorance, see as conflicting with my worldview. I'm a guy who prefers to hope for the best but prepares for the worse. In issues of dispute, I often follow the harshest recommendations when it comes to them, so I could avoid doing that which is haram, and pursue that which is halal. But there are some things I (again, from the meaningless point of the creation) see as senseless. Chess, for instance. In most games that don't involve things that are trivially haram, such as betting and the like, the recommendation is to let it not interfere with the obligations of every Muslim, which I never had problems following, nor see any problem with. But in the specific case of chess, some would go as far as saying it is completely haram, because it depicts \"an idol of a horse\". What is that supposed to mean? I'm not worshipping it, it's not like every chess player has an altar in their home dedicated to \"The Cult of The Chess Horse Piece\". Evolution is another issue. Why would we deny such a simple thing, that also happens to be the pillar of one of the most important science fields we have?  \n\n\nAgain, I do not feel like I'm right, but I have to admit, my faith is shaken. I can understand why Allah (SWT) would forbid the consumption of alcohol, or betting, but to tell me I'm not allowed to make ANY objective statement stating Earth's shape?  \n\n\nI feel ashamed of my petulance, but I don't seem to be able to reconcile those things.

Although, what constitutes as gambling still remains unaswered. Many scholars will say, gambling is any game of chance as many Ahadees have this term used. Although, this is still too broad because investments/businesses fall under this 'game of chance' category as well. Hence, we have our 1st point regarding gambling;\n\n**1) Gambling is a game of chance, though not all games of chance are gambling**\n\nIf we use Quran for a reference, we have the follow Ayat;\n\n*\u201cThey ask you, O Muhammad, concerning alcoholic drink and maysir. Say:* ***they contain great sin and benefit for people, but their sin is greater than their benefit***\\*. And they ask you what should they give to charity? Say: that which is more than their need, And so Allah shows you wisdom\\* ***so that maybe you will think***\\*\u201d \\[Quran, Chapter: Al-Baqra, Verse No:219\\]\\*\n\nIt becomes clear that gambling is something that has a benefit if you win, although the negative impacts outweigh the positives. If we place a bet, then this has a negative impact on the society. How? Assuming we win, we'll just be usurping someone else's money based off luck. On the other hand if we lose, that'll hurt us both emotionally and financially.\n\nAs per my interpretation, the last part of this Ayat '***that maybe you will think***' means that Allah Almighty wants us to think and use our senses to determine whether something is a gamble or not. So that is point number 2;\n\n**2) The negatives outweigh the positives.**\n\n\u201cO you who believe, intoxicants, **Maysir**, sacrificing for idols and **making decisions based on games of chance** are filth from the work of satan, so avoid these things and you may prosper. **Satan desires to create enmity and hatred amongst you through intoxicants and gambling** and to stop you from praying and remembering Allah. So will you abstain from these things?\u201d \\[Quran 5:90-91\\]\n\nThis is rather simple because gambling undoubtedly creates hatred and animosity between people. Business is helpful for the society despite having a \\~**80%** chance of failing within the first 5 years. In contrast, a casino offering a 5% chance of failure is gambling as you're literally taking someone else's money.\n\n**3) Gambling leads to hatred amongst people.**\n\nIf we incorporate the concept of Gharar (risk, uncertainty) then things become much more clear. Gharar (I'll call this uncertainty from now) has 2 types, high uncertainty and low uncertainty.\n\n1. You buy a house and find a broken bulb. That is low uncertainty.\n2. You buy something that is not yet built, with you expected to pay the price in the future. Assuming inflation and other uncertain impacts, this is high uncertainty.\n\nThough not from the Quran, many islamic financial analysts use Gharar to tell whether something is gambling or not. If something has a high uncertainty/risk, that is gambling.\n\n**4) Gambling has a high risk**\n\n**The need?**\n\nI'm no scholar and merely a student. Although, I've seen many people blindlessly saying that anything that involves chances are haram. I've derived this definition of gambling from the Quran and basically, you need to do a cost-benefit analysis. Does your 'game of chance' hurt the society? Take an example,\n\n* You whole-heartedly offer $100 to a random person from your class. No one needs to pay anything. Although, the winner will be selected based off chance. Is this gambling? Not necessarily because this has a net positive impact on our society because no one loses anything, infact someone is gaining more money.\n\nReally hope to see some feedback from you brothers and sisters.

There is a trend I have been noticing since I was younger. I think I have a very high sex drive and it sucks being single, right? I always wondered where I got the ideas of sex from and I realized it is something that has been taught to me ever since I was younger. Any TV show or movie I've watched a a kid, sex was always involved. Any social media apps you use today, sex is there. Even look at reddit, there is always a discussion on sex from horny people trying to get a discussion going about it. It is something that fascinates us but also destroys us from inside out. Our mental wellbeing can be deteriorated from it and I see this happening with me on certain days. I am ashamed to say thing but I missed 10 fasts this year because the sexual urge was too great just from subconscious thoughts of things I've seen in the past. The whole sexual liberalization movement has backfired and destroyed our society. Alhamdulillah for islam though. At least it restricts us from it. But I also learned that muslims are out here committing zina every week because of these ideas they have in their mind. Some of them are extremely depressed after doing it but feel they need to fulfill that void in their hearts. Even myself, I have thought of committing zina for the past 2-3 years now. Fantasizing about it and coming very close to it (sometimes with other muslms). It also doenst help that I try to use muslim marriage apps (like Muzz and salams) and 95% of the girls there are basically naked or uncovered yet they want a religious man to date? I hate it so much but dont know what to do about it. Here are some of the steps that I am taking to help save myself from all of this.\n\n1. stop using all forms of social media except for messaging apps. No Reddit, FaceBook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Youtube even\n2. Stop watching tv and movies cause its all sexualized now. No Netflix or any form of TV\n3. to relax, listen to islamic podcasts or genuinely good podcasts that dont talk about useless trash. Find alternative forms of entertainment that are healthy for the mind. Play sports, hang out with friends, explore your neighborhood, talk to strangers even if you dont want to.\n4. i want to get married soon so i kinda have to use muslim marriage apps until i find someone on there. Even using the apps are super depressing in themselves. But Insha'Allah I can find someone so I don't have to see all the trash on there.\n5. Meditation. It is sunnah to take time to yourself in seclusion and just reflect on life. Stop the racing thoughts and just relax and appreciate what you have in life. Also helps with self control\n6. Lowering my gaze in public.... Not enough people do this enough.\n7. Looking at examples of people whose lives have been destroyed by their physical urges. Whether they have to pay for child support or fell depressed by it. I know many public and private figures who have gone through this.\n8. try not to be alone. And when i am alone, be aware of allah as if he is in the room with you. Allah is what his slave thinks of him. So think of him in a positive light. He's my protector and friend. I shall not anger him or disobey him because he knows whats best for me.\n\nThis is coming from someone who has been addicted to sex (literally fantasize about it all the time) for the past 12+ years (literally half my life). If there is anyone out there that is struggling with it, just know you understanding that it is an issue is already a huge advantage. Please don't fall for the trap of thinking sexual thoughts will make you happy. The most beautiful and attractive women and men I know are those who protect their private parts and are fearful of their lord. They abstain from doing bad and don't have their lives ruined by the whispers of the shaytan. I'm at a point where I don't care if people do what their desires tell them to. It is actually a disadvantage for them to be addicted to sex. But it really hurts when I see my fellow brothers and sisters fall for these traps.\n\nThere are so many other things that are bad in this life that we must avoid that destroy us in our minds and our hearts. Gambling, alcohol, sex, social media (other than messaging apps), gaming, overeating, etc. But the funny thing is we are pushing for more freedom in all of these things and encouraging them rather than explaining the dangers of them.

He doesn't believe in God, afterlife, etc. He's still virgin not because he doesn't want to have sex before marriage, but cuz he never has a chance so far.\n\nHe was so sweet to me especially in our earlier interactions. Sent me his pics/video of himself and family, initiated convos, initiated movie dates every week, etc without me asking him.

In another talk, he broke another promise. I tried to understand cuz he changed his mind and stuff so I didn't demand him to stay with his promise.\n\nIn short, he knows about my feelings from my friend and after few months we had a convo and he said that he has a crush on someone.

And so, how to make him revert if not through dating?\n\n2. I want to move on from this feeling for him. Maybe Allah loves me that's why He gives me a heartbroken feeling for him (?). I want to move on cuz I'm afraid he will punish me or my family etc. Is it the right thinking of mine?\n\n3. The crush is probably a Muslim girl too. If one day they would really dating, part of me will be sad and jealous cuz he'll be dating a Muslim girl and not me. What if the story I've imagined before (about him revert through dating) will happen with this girl? I'll be so sad cuz it's not me. So, I wonder if my decision to stay away from any interactions that make me fall for him harder to stay away with dating are correct? \n\n4. I plan to move on by staying away from him for a while. If I healed, I won't mind to have a friend talk with him again. But, he seems doesn't wanna me to leave cuz of the game and probably won't talk ever to me again if I were taking a break.

There is a popular gaming marketplace called Steam and there is a game called CS:GO (Counter Strike : Global Offensive)\n\nIn this game CS:GO, there are guns and you can customize them with \"skins\". These are basically just different styles for the guns. But there is a big market around these weapon skins where you can buy and sell them on the Steam Marketplace. The money you earn goes to your Steam Wallet which you can use to buy other games and other items or even more weapon skins.\n\nTechnically you can't widthdraw the money out of your steam wallet. You can only use it on Steam.\n\nBut the way you earn these weapon skins in CS:GO is very sketchy and many people dislike it. There are things in the game called 'cases'. You can earn the cases in game for free and can sell them on the Steam marketplace.\n\nBut you can also pay $2.50 to open up these cases and you can basically gamble to get an expensive item which you can sell. Opening cases is basically gambling. Gambling is haram.\n\nWhat I've been doing was selling these cases when I got them for free in game and used them to get discounts and buy other games or other weapon skins. But I realized that this was haram since I was technically helping other people in doing sin.\n\nI have stopped selling weapon skins and cases all together since it could be haram and I'm not going to risk it.\n\nBut the problem is that I used that haram money to buy and get discounts on other games and I still have money leftover in my Steam Wallet so even if I go to buy other games with clean money it will automatically use the haram money in my Steam Wallet.\n\nI'm going to try and contact the support to remove the remaining money in my Steam Wallet and to remove the 80,000 Steam points I had because some of that came from the cases.\n\nBut there are still some games and items that I might not be able to get rid of and I might not even be able to remove the Steam Wallet money or the 8,000 Steam points.\n\nIf I can't, can I still play those games and use that money and use the items and steam points?\n\nI'm not going to sell anymore cases or weapon skins but I'm unsure what to do with the stuff I got from them.\n\nThank you for reading.", "would it be permissible for me to hang posters of other 'gods' like images from Greek mythology etc?", "Is playing any super Mario bro games halal or haram?", "To distract his 4-year old daughter, her father has made up a game.

Thanks", "Stop sharing videos of terrorist attacksEDIT: I was mistaken, the comment about New Zelanders being at risk was not made by the PM, but the foreign minister Winston Peters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/18/erdogan-shows-christchurch-attack-footage-at-rallies)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am shocked that Erdogan would think that would be an appropriate thing to show at a rally. Damn. The terrorist livestreamed it because he wanted people to see Muslims as people being gunned down: to dehumanise, weaken and strike them with fear. In doing so, he wanted to spark a race-religious war between Muslims and non-Muslims. The disgraceful video is dehumanising and spreading it violates basic Islamic norms. Not only because we are supposed to cover the dead bodies out of respect. Why on Earth he thought this would be a good idea is shocking. And it's commendable how the New Zealand Prime Minister is reacting to this by reaching out to Muslims and minority communities, instead of further dividing them from the dominant \"white\" communities. Trump asked the New Zealand PM what he could do to help. She replied to send sympathy and love to Muslim communities. When have we heard the Muslims using their influence with Trump to say such a thing? The Arabs were dancing with him not so long ago because he sold them weapons, which they would use to bomb other starving Muslims. We are at a point where non-Muslim leaders are giving dawah to invite Muslim leaders back to Islam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis reminds me of a picture a few years back of a diplomatic meeting between an East-Asian nation and a rich Arab nation; I can\u2019t remember the exact details. Typically, the Arabs would invite foreign leaders into luxurious, excessively fancy rooms with large golden furniture and the whole lot. The East-Asian nation, I think it was Japan, invited the Arab person into a basic simple room with two small chairs. It was doing quite the rounds on social media that the non-Muslims were giving Muslim leaders dawah. Anyone remember it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith regards to showing footage of atrocities generally, it can be effective at raising awareness. For example, when there are dozens of terrorist attacks (eg. Gaza, Syria, Yemen) when bombs are dropped on civilians and also when chemical weapons are used; video footage of such large-scale massacres are important because people minimise the horror of such atrocities and often outright deny that the suffering even exists, as if people like Bashar al-Assad or the IDF are righteous. However, in this case, there is no awareness that can be brought by spreading this video. It's disgusting and unnecessary. Progress is being made and communities are coming together, by the will of Allah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith regards to the fact that the footage of terrorist attacks by Muslims (eg. the killing of Lee Rigby) were shown to the public repeatedly and a racist effort was made to demonise the whole community from them, these were done under racist governments by racist media outlets to advance a racist \u201cwar (of) terror\u201d propaganda narrative for political gain. This attack was done in a country under the rule of a caring and respectful leader who is taking charge and trying to unite communities and restore order, rightly so. ~~And as she has also commented,~~ Erdogan sharing the video even endangers New Zealanders, who have nothing to do with this attack. It\u2019s divisive and harms relations; everything we should not be taking away from it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStudying terrorist attacks strictly for educational purposes and to understand why they happen and how to stop them is fine (for example, reading the manifesto; note: only if it\u2019s for an academic purpose), but there is no benefit in seeing our own brothers and sisters being gunned down in such a disgraceful way. And from the perspective of the terrorist, no less. It is in the format of some kind of perverted video game. Yes, there are some things we can learn. For example, we can be touched that a brother greeted him out of peace before the attack. However, not everyone needs to see that video to be made aware of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t expect Erdogan or other political leaders to see this and take heed. But can our brothers and sisters not get involved in sharing the video? If it would be beneficial for some educational reason, then fine. However, the vast majority of people who watch videos of atrocities do so for an entertainment and shock factor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs-Salaamu Alaykum.", "Why don\u2019t I see a lot of Muslims making art?I feel like a lot of diaspora communities tend to have a strong internal as well as external culture. Asian communities, Jewish communities, black communities, all have unique art that has bled into pop culture. Things like music, actual art, language, beliefs etc. were all made by these groups that the majority population began to like as well. \n\nBut when examining the Muslim diaspora I don\u2019t see a lot of \u201ccreation in hardship\u201d to put it bluntly. I really appreciate when it does happen but it feels like it\u2019s few and far in between. \n\nMs. Marvel is one of my favorites because she doesn\u2019t sacrifice being Muslim. She prays, stays away from alcohol/haram etc. and she\u2019s a well written character. \n\nThere was an indie video game a while back that I thought was pretty neat called \u201cthe cat in the hijab\u201d.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen \u201cRamy\u201d but I know it\u2019s controversial because of how it handles sex/drinking/smoking etc. \n\nI feel like, as a community, we fear that by interacting with western culture, we\u2019ll end up abandoning Islam, so we barricade ourselves in a strict box and anyone outside that box is doing kufr and those closest to the center are less kafir than those outside. I don\u2019t know. \n\nThis is a discussion that I strongly want to have because I feel like living in the US I have to choose between two parts of myself. Either I go out and drink and smoke and have sex or I stay within my barricaded community, read Quran 24/7 and disavow \u201cthe West\u201d at every turn. Neither of which I find acceptable.\n\nIn any case what are your opinions on anything I\u2019ve said?", "Something I don't understand about music and drawing.I recently have heard that things like music and drawing can be haram. However, I don't fully understand.\n\n**Music**\n\nWhen I first learned that music was haram, I had a bit of doubt. I thought that \"Ok, maybe music with bad lyrics or something like that is haram\" But as I learned more I started to realize that pretty much all music is haram. There's an ayat in the Quran for this. And there's some hadith about this too. Also, I think music becoming more common was a prediction than our Prophet(saw) made. \n\nHowever is all music really haram? In a lot of the educational videos with scholars and such that I have watched, they say that music is haram because it can lead them to harmful things. And this is not wrong. Music and be manipulative and it can dominate people's minds. It may lead to haram things like alcohol, sexual intercourse, crime, dancing, gambling, dancing in public and other bad stuff. It not surprising how effective it is on people's brains.\n\nHowever, what about music that doesn't have lyrics? Just melodies that you listen to relax or have on the background when you watching a program or playing a video game or when studying or when you go to a mall or something. That isn't being talked all that much. I usually never actively listen to music. I don't have a Spotify list or anything that sorts. I never just sit in bad and listen music from my phone. Sometimes soundtracks. Some people say that \"innocent\" music is also haram becomes it engages your mind and takes you away from the remembrance of Allah. However, I feel like that logic seems a bit flawed. When you think about it, most things you do engage your mind and you have to focus on it. Like studying, working, listening to a lesson in school.... you name it. Are these also haram? Some people also say than when they quit listening to music things like nasheed and Quran recitations start to sound more beautiful. Now if you want you can just listen to these in your free time instead of music. There's no problem with that and it's also good if you do that. But the problem is that these don't fit everything. Imagine watching a cooking program or playing a video game and listening to a soundtrack or you go to a shop. And instead of normal music, there's just Quran recitation. I don't want to be disrespectful or anything but that just seems kinda weird to me. It doesn't go well with everything. \n\n**Drawing**\n\nFrom what I have learned drawing living beings or things that have a soul is haram. While drawing inanimate beings or soulless things is ok. \n\nBut why? There's an authentic hadith that says that making images is a very big sin. There's an ayat about this also. However, some other hadiths say that this only goes for living things. Sources say that it is haram because you are imitating Allah's creation and you are going to be told to give life to things you made in the day of judgment. Since you obviously won't be able to, You'll go to hell.\n\nBut I don't understand. Most artists and painters nowadays obviously know that they can't compete with Allah when it comes to creation. Allah's the best creator after all. They also know that they can't give life to pictures depicting alive beings. They know it's all imaginary. It's just for aesthetic and creative purposes. Maybe as a way of expression. So why are treated as if they assume and believe such bad things?  \n\nAlso with that logic, you can say that drawing inanimate things is also haram because aren't those also creations of Allah?
