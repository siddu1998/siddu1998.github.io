Current research is non conclusive in either direction if I remember correctly. Virtual world might offer an alternate avenue to relieve stress hence making said individual more unlikely to commit real world aggression but this doesn't say anything about if that individual is experiencing an overall uptick in aggressive impulses which he/she then satisfies via more gaming.

None of them has any life into it. \\nYou are just interacting with nothing more than logs of wood.\\n\\nTo define “killing” a living entity must be present and must be defined as the killer; another living being instead will be called the victim. \\nWithout one of these no killing is possible. \\n\\nIt’s how we define killing that shapes the actions and therefore Karma. \\nAssuming a virtual character has life in it is just a mistake based on a “simulated liveness” which of course is nothing more than a mere illusion. \\n\\nPeace.', 'want to know all about karma1.

Maya in simple terms is defined as space, time and causation. All the objective quantities in the universe which we can perceive through our senses and mind (in the form of thoughts, beliefs, etc) all come under Maya. Within maya, one objective quantity can be simplified and explained in terms of other objective quantity.  In particular, all your questions regarding karma are of this type.\\n\\nBut all of maya is just an appearance of the ultimate truth; Atman(which is very loosely translated as soul, whose meaning varies from context to context), which encompasses all the objective happenings in maya. The Atman is not an object, rather, it is that which illumines every objective experience in maya. Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya.

My name is Tirtha. I joined the temple a year ago and my life has completely transformed. Before coming here I was a confused young boy, who had just finished school. I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.). But by the mercy of my teachers, I was able to transform my life and become a better person. Although I have just started my path. I can confidently say that my life is meaningful and it has a deep purpose. I am happy, therefore I want to share this opportunity with others.\\n\\nBrahmacharya is a life of a monk, it\\'s a commitment to restrict oneself from sense gratification, and focus on your spiritual growth. Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek. There is a beautiful lake right next to us and breathtaking waterfalls just a few minutes away. It is a peaceful, quiet, and relaxing environment that is perfect for our spiritual practice.\\n\\nThis is exactly what we are doing in our ashram (temple). We are training young men (from 18 years old) to become strong, responsible individuals in our society. We are studying Vedic scriptures, under the guidance of our teacher Rasik Mohan Prabhu who is a lifelong monk, and who lived in a monastery in India for 16 years of his life. Every day we are practicing yoga and meditation. We also have a lot of service (seva) to do. Our project started only a year and a half ago. We have a lot of things to do and we are also open to new possibilities.\\n\\nWe are also learning many different arts and skills such as yoga, meditation, visualization, construction, painting, building, gardening, book publication, writing, singing, artistic skills, memorizing verses, studying different scriptures, public speaking, and many other things.\\n\\nSo as a resident of the monastery I am inviting every young man who is interested to come and learn how to think like a monk, and most importantly how to live like a monk.\\n\\nIf you are interested or have any questions you can write here or contact me: brotherhoodofmonks@gmail.com\\n\\nNamaste,\\n\\nTirtha', 'Am I correct in understanding that you belong to the gauDIya vaiShNava sampradAya but not to ISKCON?', 'I wish more young people would take up monkhood in a traditional way.', 'Bhagwan Shiva and Bhagwan Ganesha in game , your thoughts , video link in comments', 'Namaste, thank you for the submission.

The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis.

Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point. Till we attain moksha which is the same as realizing that we are eternally Brahman, the normal rules of morality, human ends, meaning etc all apply. \\n\\nTo give an example, we all know that the world is made of fundamental particles of various kinds. However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels. All this everything is me etc is just a vessel to carry you to the truth and the vessel has to be abandoned one day, too. Like a boat, incredibly useful - to the other side of the river, then you abandon it and walk.\\n\\nWe use a thorn analogy, we use a thorn (advaita vedanta) to remove another thorn (human suffering) and then we discard both.\\n\\nAll this I am consciousness and everyone is me, etc etc will be refined and transformed. There is no I, consciousness is not an I. The I is the ego it\\'s ahaṃkara and consciousness is something completely different. The fact you can see the object of I-ness is proof it is not pure consciousness.\\n\\nReality is nondual, it\\'s not perceivable unless you\\'re using a mind to have transactions but the mind will limit you to a perspective of reality that is from the point of view of the mind. Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing. This disqualifies it\\'s classification of being nihilistic. Since nihilism has a \"no point\" sort of feel, and in Vedanta we believe existence is the point. Vedanta adds meaning to life, it doesn\\'t remove it.', 'What you said isn\\'t true for just Advaita Vedanta, it is true for all of Vedanta. The point that \"whatever I do is a barrier for moksha\".

Hence it seems best that he should answer your doubt as well directly. \\n\\n[Refutation of Fatalism - Yoga Vashishta](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/yoga-vasistha-english/d/doc118039.html)\\n\\nYou can read the preceding 5 chapters to get an understanding of the basis for it if you wish.

Because if the question was asking for parallels between Buddhism(shoonyavad) and nihilism it would just be an ordinary philosophy class question.\\nBut the fact that the two, Advaita Vedanta and Nihilism might have some parallel, even such confusion is an insight.\\nAnd I would like to consider them one by one, so to start with Advaita Vedanta, I would like to quote a phrase from Adi Shankaracharya, \\n\"Brahman Satya Jagat Mithya, Jeevo Brahmaiv Na Parah.\"\\nThis translates to Brahman alone is real, the universe(or world) is unreal, and the individual self is no other than Brahman itself(the supreme self).\\nFor nihilism, I would like to define it as the following \"extreme scepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real existence.\"\\nSo the common thing between them is the negative value ascribed to the existence. \\nBut nihilism only ends there and has no other conclusion to draw from this fact.\\nWhile Advaita Vedanta, though says the world is unreal, but it has a conclusion, or an assertion to make regarding the reality of the individual. So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings. This is ego, made possible by mind and the senses, powered by intellect. \\n\\nThere are two ways I can describe our situation-\\n\\nA. Video game  \\nB. Dream\\n\\nIn all this \\'video game\\' we are a part of, we often forget ourselves, playing hours and hours (lives), initially remembering ourselves, but just for fun. Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives. He stabs you in the chest and you see that another person was watching impassively neither helping you nor the other guy. Now you wake up. Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan. You and the countless others before you and after you are the same, parts of dream of Vishnu. Now, you might think, why should I suffer for his Leela? He ain\\'t paying my emi nor helping me deal with office politics.

In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy. But no such luck with Krishna, he\\'s simply a forced antagonist who you can\\'t side with.\\n\\nand the last thing i will talk about, the character design: now, [his regular form](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/8/8d/SMT_IV_FINAL_Krishna.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025173647) is a pretty good design personally, and along with being very expressive it does a good job conveying his charming, calm but also snarky and sometimes sarcastic. i\\'m not sure whether i\\'d say \"that\\'s Krishna\" the first time i saw his design, but he definitely feels like krishna when i look at him (at least to me)\\n\\nBut his [vishnu](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_B_SMT4A.jpg) [designs](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_II_SMTIVA_Official_Art.jpg) seem to go more with the forced antagonist role he plays in the story; maybe the design is referencing something i don\\'t know, but with the \"nandakas\" in the second form that really look more like lightsabers, i can\\'t help but to look at vishnu and think \"what is he, a sith lord?\" Kinda discredits him as a god of preservation when his design seems to just say *evil*\\n\\nSo that about wraps it up, but as a note i should say that my goal is not to upset or get anyone offended with this post. i\\'m just curious to see what this community thinks of Krishna\\'s whole portrayal in this game. is it faithful to his origins or not? is this offensive or are these just silly video games that shouldn\\'t be taken seriously? Are the designs any good or do they just discredit him as a deity?

L. Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes. This then to us regular ppl appears as someone having a really really sh\\\\*tty life full of misery, suffering, etc. SO Karma indeed is the answer but there are nuances within that as well.', \"4. The creature experiencing the evil is an incarnation of God, taking on the pain for some reason that will be known later.\\n\\nExample: the Ramayana\\n\\nAlso, I don't really consider 2 or 3 to be reasons for evil to exist. They are just incidental side effects of 1: Karma.\", \"I would argue that a omnibenevelant God would do bad in the interest of good by helping us grow through suffering. As demonstrated by yin and yan, there is good in bad and bad in good. So I would extend your reincarnation point to growth within a single life, as well as over multiple life times.\\n\\nThe point of good and evil being illusionary is interesting. I understand its called illusionary as we as humans conceptualise everything and as we do our definitions are out of touch with the way things are, it's not actually saying that these things don't exist. This teaching is only calling for a deeper understanding into reality, such as, can evil be classed as inheriently bad if its nessesary for good to exist?\", \"I've never heard of this 'well known' argument.

This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe).

I am enchanted.', '[deleted]', 'Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism# Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism\\n\\nsource: paraphrased from several talks by Swami Paramarthananda.\\n\\nThere is a lot of confusion around the necessity and role of Vedas and guru in Hinduism.  These are some common questions that people have.\\n\\n1. Why do I need to study the Vedas?\\n2. Is a guru really necessary?\\n3. Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.

May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus?

I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house. I have come to Hinduism after a long exploration of other religions since my teens. ', \"Hinduism is difficult to understand in few short paras or even book. For example, many hindus will refute your claim about it being polytheistic, stating all those gods/demi-gods etc are just manifestation of one power which is formless and attribute-less (some hindus will claim one god but with attribute and form instead).

Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred. Offer your food to the god you wish to please (offering to Krishna pleases all the gods).\\n\\nReincarnation: Your next vessel is a result of the karma (action) of this life and previous lives. You can overcome reincarnation by returning to Godhead/Krishnaloka/Vaikuntha.\\n\\nThe meaning of life, in my opinion, is to live for Krishna and create a better world for all living entities.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha.

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \\n\\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \\n\\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\\n\\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\\n\\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\\n\\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \\n\\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*', '\"you are the universe experiencing itself\"', 'Namaste, thank you for the submission.

The younger people often answered, that virtual creatures are just like a theater or puppet that cannot experience suffering, so there is no karmic consequence of killing virtual creatures in video games.\\n\\nBut some older people answered, that even if they cannot feel any suffering, the act of killing by the people who kill virtual creatures, creates bad karma, because they show no mercy and compassion.\\n\\nI also would guess, that we cannot know, of virtual creatures suffer or not. It could also be, that now that there are virtual existences, beings can be born as a creature in a video game and suffer a thousand times by getting killed by players over and over again.\\n\\nThere are also some differences to theater and films, because the actors just performing a story. In virtual worlds, people kill virtual creatures, to getting more powerful, or gain more reputation, gold or points, which is similar to greed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhat do you think?', \"What about the one doing the killing? \\n\\nAre you excited, proud, distressed, uncomfortable, detached? \\n\\nThe 'suffering' isn't only experienced by the being that is killed.\", 'I think The act of killing virtual characters in of itself wouldn’t generate bad karma, but it would negatively affect your consciousness and endanger you to develop increasing desires to inflict pain and suffering which may culminate in you hurting a fellow jiva.\\n\\nAlso, if your act of killing or otherwise harming a virtual character are witnessed by another and it inspires them to harm others, then I think you’d inherit some bad karma.', \"Killing virtual entities is not a sin imo as they don't have jeeva\", 'It all depends on intention. There is no soul in video game characters. Yet, your intentions comes into play. There is always karma. Your intention creates karma. For example, if someone is rich and looks down on everyone (in his mind) who is poorer than him but he does not act upon it and feels proud within, there is karma even there. Bad thoughts always keep coming into our mind randomly. Thoughts that dominates the mind will cause karma. Try looking at this in the pov of playing a video game and what thoughts are coming in. It’s just my opinion.', 'Virtual killing I would say only creates paap if you want to cause harm to the being', \"I believe it is safe to assume that violence against virtual entities to be similar to violent/aggressive thoughts/feelings to someone else since both don't directly result in real world violence. The following is stated under this assumption:\\n\\nThere are no thought crimes in hindu doctrine of karma so it is not a bad thing directly.  But we hindus believe thoughts and actions mutually reinforce each other by creating impressions in the chitta. Our thoughts prime our behaviour. Unwholesome thoughts prime us/increase the likelihood of us to commit unwholesome actions that would then result in paap.\\n\\nI believe the effect of violent video games on human psyche  is a subject of active academic research. Current research is non conclusive in either direction if I remember correctly. Virtual world might offer an alternate avenue to relieve stress hence making said individual more unlikely to commit real world aggression but this doesn't say anything about if that individual is experiencing an overall uptick in aggressive impulses which he/she then satisfies via more gaming. You can read more about them in their respective websites/articles etc. You can also look into studies that investigate how pornography and the type of pornography affects the psyche and if this is correlated with rape crimes.

None of them has any life into it. \\nYou are just interacting with nothing more than logs of wood.\\n\\nTo define “killing” a living entity must be present and must be defined as the killer; another living being instead will be called the victim. \\nWithout one of these no killing is possible. \\n\\nIt’s how we define killing that shapes the actions and therefore Karma. \\nAssuming a virtual character has life in it is just a mistake based on a “simulated liveness” which of course is nothing more than a mere illusion. \\n\\nPeace.', 'Some models for my Upcoming Game based on Indian gods.

If it is about the experience, there are infinite way a soul can experience difficulties in different ways.

This karma is called prarabdha and it contains both karma with beneficial consequences/phala and those with antagonistic consequences. Depending on the relative ratio - your life would vary from super easy mode to hell difficulty.\\n\\n\\n>4. Is it like a video game? Collect n number of karma to go to swarga, x for vaikuntha etc.?\\n\\nDepends on the denomination. Your good actions doesn\\'t override the bad ones. You go to swarga to enjoy the rewards that weren\\'t adequately rewarded and you go to naraka to get punished for that which were not adequately punished. Another interpretation  is that swarga is life on the world in super easy mode where you get everything for little effort and naraka is life on earth in hell mode where the world is out to screw you.\\n\\n>5. Who decides good or bad karma? Hinduism is not like Christianity or Islam who think that there is an absolute \"good\" and absolute \"evil\".\\n\\nAll actions have consequences. Beneficial vs Antagonistic is more appropriatethan good vs bad in my opinion. Causality doesn\\'t necessarily need an ishvara - so answer varies with denomination \\n\\n\\n>6. How does my karma up till now affect my current life?\\n\\nIt affects by determining the difficulty for every task and prunes the game tree accordingly. Now let us say you want to give an exam - if you have very good prarabdha then you can score 100 by studying the night before exam. If your prarabdha is very negative then you may barely pass by studying very hard throughout the year. \\n\\n\\n>7.

Maya in simple terms is defined as space, time and causation. All the objective quantities in the universe which we can perceive through our senses and mind (in the form of thoughts, beliefs, etc) all come under Maya. Within maya, one objective quantity can be simplified and explained in terms of other objective quantity.  In particular, all your questions regarding karma are of this type.\\n\\nBut all of maya is just an appearance of the ultimate truth; Atman(which is very loosely translated as soul, whose meaning varies from context to context), which encompasses all the objective happenings in maya. The Atman is not an object, rather, it is that which illumines every objective experience in maya. Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya.

Do not pressurise yourself, thinking, \"I NEED TO ACHIEVE ETERNAL PEACE!\" no, no! Peace cannot be achieved in such a manner. Do your work without expecting results, good or bad. When the results come, accept them without hesitation. Enjoy the results, if good, suffer the results, if bad, but do not get attached to them.

It is beyond utility. If you have a taste of this existence beyond purpose, of life beyond sense, you are enlightened. ‘It is possible for us to speculate and create endless stories about why creation happened,’ said the great teacher. ‘If I tell you a story, you can either believe it or disbelieve it.

Don\\'t get me wrong I still love Hinduism and I will follow it till I die because I was born a Hindu. And the other day my mom told me to go to the temple every Tuesday and Saturday.

Good job bro.', 'Always wanted a Ramayana game myself', 'Early access pleaseeeee', 'how Authoritative are Dhramshastras/smrities??Manu Smrti is supposedly told as the work Of the man who calls himself as the patriarch of humans, the Manu. His book mainly deals with how one can apply the concepts of law and order in daily life, personal, social and universal levels. However, the book, as is evident from its inconsistent manuscripts all over India, is not entirely the work of a single self assumed “Manu”, but rather a collective work of creative and stubborn fascists who had but a very strong vision on rule-making and science of administration.\\n\\nBefore we spit out to the Manu and the Brahmins, we must also note that Manu could not have been a single author, and he could not have been a fully racist casteist. Though Manu does appear racist fascist in designating non Aryans outside Aryavarta as barbarians, and casteist through his statements, it is to be noted that only less than 60% of the book is really authentic. And within that, there are internally inconsistent verses. So, in whole, even to this day, one can follow the Manu smrti that suits him, from the collection of verses we have today.\\n\\nSo what does it speak about?\\n\\nContrary to the popular belief, Manu smrti is not about imposing rule in lower castes, but it is a text that really traps Brahmins (which eventually forced Brahmins to manipulate it by adding escape clauses), and makes him not more than a robot, without self opinion or thought or choice of action. Having killed his opportunities and pleasures, the Manu “genersously” gives Brahmin a position highest in the society. (And does not forget to mention that Brahmins should always follow those restrictions) But yea, our later Manus who tampered with the text created verses that finally created an arrogant Brahmin caste in top with immense positions, who could not be questioned, but could dictate anything.\\n\\nManu discusses in detail about the different “Varnashramas” of different castes. The Brahmin’s part is naturally the largest, consisting of restrictions for every breath and movement. Almost four whole chapters are dedicated to restricting, controlling and immobilizing the Brahmin. Manu makes many clauses, some of them directly contradicting, but in the core, Manu wants Brahmin to be simply spiritual, above worldly pleasures, and highly orthodox. Manu, apart from prohibiting meat for Brahmins (somewhere else he also comments that one may eat meat “incidentally” as a leftover of a legitimate animal sacrifice), also prohibits a wide range of foods right from onion, garlic, mushroom… Brahmin is also prohibited to do any jobs other than his Veda teaching, learning, gifting, receiving business. And Manu also considers the following to be highly shameful jobs to a Brahmin (apart from the other “prohibited” jobs of other castes) : astrology, music, dance, doctor… Even Brahmin’s dress code is highly limited - he cannot wear beard if without proportionate hair locks, and even in such cases, the Brahmin with hair locks is not called to many functions like death anniversary feasts. His normal clothing, normal appearance, the attitude everything is predefined. Everything right from breathing (not joking), even eating posture (again, not a joke), walking, doing jobs, when to teach, when to learn, what to not do, how to not live your life, what not to eat, what not to think, what not to wear, where not to live, who should not invited for your parties and feasts, what not to desire, whom to marry, whom not to……\\n\\nNow comes the part of Kshatriya, the king. The Manu unlike the prohibition he made for all Brahmins from worldly pleasures, allows those “pleasures” to the king, but without addiction. However, Manu does create limits to the king and asks him to stay away from certain vices. The king’s laws are there in two chapters, but detailed so as to aid his rule. Personal rules are lesser. The rules of administration are well designed, though our later Manus have had a part in interpolating some “generous” verses into them.\\n\\nThe Vaishya and Shudras have rules separate, only in a single chapter, about 8 rules for Vaishyas and 2 for Shudras. Almost no personal restrictions as a part of their code, but their status much depends on the presence of other castes, the other caste determines the status of how one caste tends to behave.\\n\\nApart from all these personal restrictions to Brahmins in four long chapters (Kshatriyas have only two chaps for them, even when talking about ruling guidelines in detail), Manu supported Brahmins and Brahmanism. Manu does hint about Shramanas, and looks down upon them. The later Manus, through addition of thoughtful verses, made a Brahmin unquestionable. And, it would be silly to blame the initial Manu for all that.\\n\\nApart from the usual laws, Manu also anticipates laws during emergency periods. Here, a convenient relaxation is given in laws.\\n\\nIt is probable that initial Manu envisioned a well divided caste society with more pressure on Brahmins, who but recieved great respect, lesser pressure on King, who deserved respect from all, and almost no pressure on Shudras or Vaishyas. Castes below that have no personal restrictions - they can live their life without “offending” the other castes.\\n\\nAltogether, the Manu Smrti is a well planned, but corrupted text, just like any text post vedic age there are power games which are noticable, we know these inconsistencies come when any \\'religion\\' in power, we know this because we can observe this with Bhuddism and jainism scriptures as well, the moment they become the dominant religion of a region/s they start downplaying the \\'ahimsa\\' principal, we know that no matter the religion the priests which were patronised indulged in religious propaganda on the king\\'s behalf when their king and his ambition in regards to war and conquest grew and then they justified their \\'dharmic\\' war and their practices some of which are abbhorent, this was a practice done by every major religion in india when they were in the dominant position, this point is expanded upon in Upinder Singh\\'s book \"political violence in ancient india\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy point through all this is that given that we know there was power politics and propaganda in these smrities/shastras etc how much weightage do you place on these scriptures, they are not shruties which are the axiomatic texts of hinduism, you don\\'t buy into vedas and hinduism falls appart, that is not the case with smrities, so how much weight do you place on dhramshastras/smriti texts?? should they be read with \\'shraddha\\' and be above criticisms like vedas like manusmrities suggests or should they be subjected to scrutiniy and not be above criticisms??', 'The smriti deals with two kinds of dharma: viśesa dharma (special duties) and sāmānya dharma (common duties). The former pertains to the responsibilities allotted to the individual in the varnāśrama framework while the latter deals with the ethical and moral values that he must adopt.\\n\\nWe learn from the Gītā that varna is determined by svabhāva (nature). In the ancient past, it was possible to distinguish individual varnas by lineage alone owing to the prohibition on varna-sankara. In the modern age, where there is ambiguity regarding lineage, śīlā or character, becomes the identifying marker for varna. For it is written:-\\n\\n>**Mahābhārata Vana Parva, section CLXXIX**\\n\\n>“Men of all the four orders are without restriction constantly begetting children on women of all the varnas. And speech, cohabitation, birth and death of men of all the orders are similar in all respects. It is, on this account, that the wise have asserted that the character (śīlā) is the chief and needful thing.”\\n\\nThe injunctions of the dharmashastras regarding jurisprudence (vyavahāra), custom (ācara) and expiation (prayāschitta) cannot be applied in all circumstances for they operated on the presumption of a janma based varna system which obviously does not exist today. Thus, while the portion of the dharmaśastras pertaining to viśesa dharma is more or less defunct in this day and age, the prescribed sāmānya dharmas (such as ahimsa, āsteya, śauca) still apply.', 'The vedas are considered divine text so they are at the highest level, the other texts like smriti are not divine or authoritative, personally I think they should be ignored', 'Books for Motivation/PassionHello Everyone,\\n\\nRight now I (20M) am in a very competitive college program here in the U.S. and have worked very hard to get here, but recently I have been having a really distracted mind and unfocused on my studies.

How does one know who?This is not to cause division among Hindus so please read till the end.   \\n**Who is the almighty Vishnu or Shiva or Devi?** One has to understand the difference between portraying something as Almighty vs Discriminating against others. **Why not?** Such a description of \"Almighty\" can only be almighty because of the existence of other Non-Almighty entities to prove that.  **Why?** It\\'s like a movie where a Hero can only be a Hero because of the villain. The worse the Villain, the better the hero. This is the approach taken by many sects, **but does it mean the sects are wrong?** **No, I am not saying the Vaishnava sect or the Shaiva sect etc... are wrong,** but it\\'s not how many are portraying it to be. See, all it takes to destroy such an approach is just to prove that hero cannot be a hero without a villain. Or a king is only a king because of the people in the kingdom. If the kingdom is empty then **he is the king of what?** Another question can be asked. If the same almighty God created these non-almighty demigods, then why is the religion not written like the western religions where there is absolutely no doubt who is who and who is not? Why Vedas? Why Darshanas? Why Tantras? Why Itihasas? Any are these non-almighty gods outside the one Almighty God? Or are they within/part of the one Almighty God? If they are part of the Almighty god then that means this almighty god has parts that are non-almighty. It\\'s like saying my body has some cells that are of lesser and insignificant quality, in scientific terms, it\\'s called Cancer. So what are these sects?\\n\\nFor example, Srimad Bhagavatam is one of the pinnacle of Bhakti Puranic literature dedicated to Sri Krishna for Vaishnava. But in that, there is a chapter dedicated to Shiva in which he is addressed as Brahman. In the same Purana, Sri Vishnu calls Trimurti are essentially the same. So there was no need for a Vaishnava literature to say that. Even Prabhupad said that \"Sri Vishnu and SadaShiva are the same\" but only in one instance, but I will not go deep into them.\\n\\nNow take Devi Bhagavatam: Though it\\'s a pinnacle for Bhuvaneshwari, the highest order of sustenance is given to Sri Maha Vishnu than Shiva. They didn\\'t have to do that.\\n\\nNow go back to Itihasas: Both Shankara and Krishna are called Rudras. And Narayana says I am in the heart of Rudra and Rudra is my heart and those who make distinctions are fools.\\n\\nNow go back to great saints: TulasiDas who is a staunch devotee of Rama wrote Rama Charitramanas first gave salutations to Vani and Ganesha and also composed Rudrastakam (inhered from Ṛṣi Lomasa), why?   \\nBhartruhari a staunch devotee of Shiva said \"I do not see any fundamental difference between Shiva the Overlord of the universe, or Vishnu the Inner Soul of the universe. But still, my affection is for the one who has a crescent moon on his head\"\\n\\nVedic Rishis didn\\'t fight with each other in the Vedas claiming Vishnu is supreme to Shiva or Indra. Kenopnishad says \"Indra then recognized that Uma the daughter of the mountains is that Brahman\". Each sect was designed to emulate the Iconified version of Supremacy as the highest Pinnacle or as the whole. It\\'s done so for the purpose of Sādhanā (a focused approach to rising in consciousness, without distractions of other schools).  Only a few ignoramuses for whom devotions have not reached their hearts but reached their ego center play the supremacy games. Rest are engrossed in Sādhanā. Yet if you honestly want to get supremacy it\\'s better to join the Vishnava Group.', 'I am going to stick to the God and parts of God thing. Others can answer rest if they want.\\n\\nGod is the only cause. Both material, and efficient. Which means, whatever exists is made from and by God. God is cause, everything else is effect.

I’ve just spent a lot of time researching the community and things relating to it for purposes of creating the document I am working on because anecdotal evidence from ex shifters and my research has pointed towards the shifting mindset being harmful to one’s mental state, specifically regarding dissociation and related issues.\\n\\nI’m working on a research document and a specific part of it needed a viewpoint I could not provide, as I do not practice Hinduism- if reality shifting was actually a Hindu practice. I made a post identical to this one on the r/Buddhism subreddit as well, since it is also used to support the shifting belief system.\\n\\nFor those unaware, Reality Shifting (also called Shifting, quantum jumping, moving realities, etc.) is a HUGE community built around the idea that by using certain ‘methods’ you can move your subconscious to another reality and live out a totally new life, or that you can become aware of your already existing consciousness in another reality. Stereotypically it’s used by kids and teenagers to shift to Harry Potter and date the characters (specifically Draco) but it goes deeper than that, and many people use shifting as a way to live multiple lives with all of their favorite characters in their favorite shows/movies/anime/games/etc. Shifters tend to talk about ‘the multiverse theory’ (usually broadly or using the Many Worlds Interpretation) and use that to prove that shifting and all of these fictional worlds are real and that when they use their methods, they actually go there/become aware of their subconscious there.\\n\\nShifters tend to cite Hinduism and ‘ancient Hindu practices’ (with no elaboration) as proof that shifting is real and not just something that rose to popularity during the 2020 lockdowns on tiktok. However, I’ve yet to find any connection between shifting and Hinduism, so I thought I’d ask here. Is reality shifting or something similar part of Hinduism? How do you feel about these people using Hinduism as a way to back up their claims?', 'It sounds like they could be taking some concepts from Hinduism and misapplying them. What you are describing sounds like trying to be lost in Maya, or illusion. Can there be many realities, according to Hinduism?

I\\'ve had always wanted to, but was afraid that it would have been dismissed off as \"ridiculous\". My takeaway is since concepts like this are almost always discussed \"implicitly\"(i mean the idea of jumping realities, NOT other manifestation techniques, as the latter is discussed pretty explicitly in the Shrutis, as another commenter pointed out w quotes)  in scriptures, the only way to find an accurate answer is an in-depth reading of the Shrutis (a class of hindu scriptures, which mainly deals w philosophies, ie the Vedas and the Upanishads).\\n\\nIf you do find an answer in r /Buddhism or r /Jainism , then i\\'m sure you can trace it bk to hinduism as well since these two religions are among the offshoots of Hinduism.', \"Different realms or realities?

This is a very sick approach. Why? It\\'s like a movie where a Hero can only be a Hero because of the villain. The worse the Villain the better the hero. This is the approach taken by many. All it takes to destroy such an approach is just to prove that hero cannot be a hero without a villain. Or a king is only a king because of the people in the kingdom.

Today both Agama and Nigama are mixed like water and concrete. Only hand full of these agamic schools exists and are very secluded and hidden from popularity. Go and sit with these 6 Śākhās, spend time with them, serve them, and learn from them. Learn grammar (Vyakaranam) and get initiated. Chant and learn for 14 years.

The colloquial identification of the self and body is due to coordinative predication, which is called samAnyAdhikaranam in Sanskrit Grammar.\\n\\nThis means that the body is treated as a prakara or mode of the self, and during the time when they are associated together, i.e., the individual is alive, one can speak of the individual (body + soul) as one unit. \\n\\nIf the individual is named John, this name can be associated with the body without any error as long as John is alive, but technically, John is the name of the consciousness that inhabits John\\'s body.\\n\\nOnce John is dead, it would be incongrous (though still accepted in common parlance) to associate any name or label to the mortal remains.\\n\\nThus, as long as body and soul are associated, any property, name or label possessed by the soul is transferred without any error onto the associated body. This is the principle of SharirAtmabhava that was the bedrock of scriptural interpretation used by Swami Ramanuja and his followers. \\n\\nUsing this principle, they were able to provide a consistent framework for interpreting the entire body shruti vAkyAs, those that taught bhEda, those that taught abhEda, and those that taught a reconciliation or ghataka between the two. In contrast, Dvaita ( viz. Advaita) has to provide a justification at the outset why Bheda ( viz. Abheda) shrutis must necessarily be the correct ones to interpret.\\n\\nNow coming to your question, Ishwara is \"in\" the bad people in the sense that Ishwara pervades their soul the same way their soul pervades the body. The karma of the bad people affects their realisation of this fact, and in their ignorance, they literally identify themselves with their gross body. The karma only affects their body and soul, but not Ishwara. The soul is affected by experiencing the fruits of its actions in this birth and next. The body is affected by actual suffering it undergoes when associated with the soul.\\n\\nIshwara is unaffected. This is the statement of the parable of two birds in the Chandogya.\\n\\nAn important corollary of Ishwara being unaffected is that he bestows free will on the Jivatmas while being the absolute master of all. He expects Jivas to seek Him of their own free will. This also means Jivas have the potential to do evil. And this is reflective of their karma rather than His will. That this free will exists is stated clearly in the Brahma Sutras, and this disposes of the problem of Evil for the Vedantin.\\n\\nAnother important corollary is that any glory of the Jivatma is a vibhuti of Ishwara, the same way that the name John that is incorrectly assigned to the body us actually the name of the soul. Similarly, any imperfections pf the conduct of the Jivatma is a product of its karma and not Ishwara\\'s will, similar to how any physical imperfections of John do not affect his soul.', 'Although demons were created by God, their purpose is to represent the adversity to overcome on the path to Enlightenment.

The idea that everything is an illusion comes from a very basic yet fundamental misunderstanding of Advaita. The different planes of existence and manifestations are not fundamentally 'true', which means that they are not beyond the realms of time, space and causation. The reality or truth is not held by the helms of time, space and causation, so from the perspective of reality, the transactional plane is mithya. But mithya does not mean false in the sense that it does not exist, it just means that it is an appearance, a limited manifestation in the helms of time, space and causation and is hence not the essential reality of things. So your very premise of the question is wrong. Of course ishvara and other deities are important in Hinduism since they are not an illusion, and neither is creation an illusion.

People come from all walks of life and from all kinds of circumstances, and approaching Hinduism purely from a spiritual standpoint is perfectly okay as a starting point. \\n\\nHowever, this stage gradually matures into the realisation that spirituality and religion are not enemies, and in fact, go hand in hand. \\n\\nImagine a building. The interiors of the building, all its various floors, right from the ground apartments to the terrace, correspond to sprituality. However, the interiors are supported by the external framework of the building, the most important part being the underground pillars and networks supporting the entire outer structure.\\n\\nThe underground pillars are the Vedas. The outer structure is itihasa and puranas. And the internal apartments in the building is sprituality, the essential teachings of religion. \\n\\nIt is impossible to ultimately be spiritual without being religious. You can have a building without apartments inside, but you can't have apartments inside without a building outside. Similarly, you can be religious without understanding its deeper teachings of spirituality, but you cannot be spiritual without being religious.\\n\\nMy basic point is this, spirituality is the epitome of religion, is the ultimate truth that religion is designed to impart to you. You cannot jump ahead directly to the truths of life without undergoing the necessary stages of development. The stages being the understanding of the scriptures, devotion for all forms of God, service to others. I've seen many people, especially in the philosophy I myself follow, that of advaita vedanta, claiming that they don't believe in God and that they are not religious. Hinduism doesn't need atheists in disguise.\\n\\nJust yesterday I saw a post on some spiritual subreddit which said 'I have opened my third eye, ask me anything.' I mean, are you serious? Have we reduced the chakras and other divine and extremely deep aspects of spirituality into some sort of game and a way of seeking validation and moral superiority and promoting pseudoscience?\\n\\nI have got into altercations with the orthodox religious people here too in the past who consider the words of the scriptures as words of God because of philosophical differences, but at least they were genuine to their philosophy and practice and were not hypocrites unlike the 'Spiritual but not religious people'. They simply see religion in a bad light and are too afraid to admit it.\\n\\nAgain, if you find yourself falling into this category, don't take this as an attack on you, but rather as an invitation to study religion deeply and with an open mind. If spirituality was simple and could be accessed directly, there would've been no need for religion in the first place.\\n\\n Orthodox religious systems are important and necessary, and while remaining stuck there and being attached to it due to identity politics is harmful, it is a necessary starting point. You need to walk into the building through the entrance, and can only then take the elevator to the topmost floor. You can't directly land on the terrace, it's called wishful thinking and lying to yourself. I'm talking to you, Advaita Vedanta. And yeah, I'm saying this as an Advaitin myself. Advaita is contaminated with these covert atheists.\", \"As I have progressed in my understanding of the many concepts and methods comprising Vedic traditions, I become more in tune with these scriptural deities, who have built some kind of temple inside my head, and they provide for me. Worship of them had always been out of respect, curiosity, enjoyment, never really knowing they would give back to me in their special ways. It's sensitivity.\\n\\nI was desensitized as a child, I think. Probably for good reason, this world is a harsh environment energetically speaking. Yoga and meditation initiated the process, but the deities, understanding them, interacting with their intelligence, opens channels within me that I have no idea how to do without those connections to the specific deity that provides, say, pain relief, as one deity does for me. When I chant to Her, it feels like cheating. Years of 🧘\\u200d♀️ yoga can't compete. But one yoga deepens into another.\\n\\nBut it has taken years to create enough inner awareness of my senses and body, mind and ego, to begin to extrapolate the essence of many practices which require, more than anything, faith, which means not quitting. For many years chanting and devotional practices really didn't produce anything tangible, and felt sometimes a bit silly, maybe. But having given the effort over time, invested, *dividends* were an unexpected grace I had no idea existed.\", \"I agree. I always  considered myself  spiritual and just had no faith that fit until I found  Hinduism.  I studied and continue to learn and reasurch religion. I think religious understanding and knowledge is essential for spirituality but I also don't believe you need to find your personal religion to be spiritual.  \\n\\nI believe that the understanding of religion can bring spirituality but from  my experience it is a hollow feeling on an intellectual level until you find the right one for you.\", 'Spirituality is the belief,  religion is the structure.\\n\\nIt is only humanity that demands the labels.', 'And what if religion fights with Sprituality instead of supporting it? Sprituality is capable enough to stand on its foot, it does not need religion.', \"Fair warning, I might not be the most educated on the topic but here's my take: being 'not religious' and being atheistic aren't always the same thing. \\n\\nFor those Hindus who focus on the concept of Brahman as the Absolute consciousness, the way they relate to it is quite different from the way you might relate to a name-and-form deity. They might not pray to Brahman. They might not ask for favours, or tell their stories, or seek grace or forgiveness, or practice rituals to propitiate Brahman. For them, realising that they and Brahman are one and the same is the only goal of their seeking. \\n\\nPeople who match the above description might not identify as religious, because their relationship with the divine is so different from the prevalent Bhakti-inspired orthodox religious practices around them.\\n\\nThat said, those who believe in Brahman, an Absolute consciousness, are not atheists. Atheists believe that consciousness is born from matter and dies with matter - if their brain loses its physical form, they will cease to exist. Also, they don't believe that the universe has any fundamental consciousness or principle that human beings will ever be capable of understanding. Both of these are ideas that any Advaitin will reject, whether they consider themselves religious or not.\\n\\n**Edit**: Not that I consider Bhakti to be an inferior way to reach the divine - I personally find bhakti and worship to be a less abstract and more effective way to connect with spirituality. But it's not the only alternative to atheism.\", 'Bro, you changed??', 'I don’t mean this as an attack but as a completely sincere question: aren’t you sort of doing the same thing as those you accuse by saying “orthodox religious systems” are just a stepping stone and sticking to them is harmful?', \"Isn't religion just organized spirituality?

I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.).

Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek. There is a beautiful lake right next to us and breathtaking waterfalls just a few minutes away. It is a peaceful, quiet, and relaxing environment that is perfect for our spiritual practice.\\n\\nThis is exactly what we are doing in our ashram (temple). We are training young men (from 18 years old) to become strong, responsible individuals in our society. We are studying Vedic scriptures, under the guidance of our teacher Rasik Mohan Prabhu who is a lifelong monk, and who lived in a monastery in India for 16 years of his life. Every day we are practicing yoga and meditation. We also have a lot of service (seva) to do. Our project started only a year and a half ago.

The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis.

On a simplistic level, the Bhakti yogi is less likely to question things as the jnana yogi is to accept things as is. \\n\\nAre these two things opposed to the other? What does reconciliation of these two really mean, does it mean you give up on one of the paths ?

We take the emigrant in our shelter from sixty thousand and ninety enemies whose conveyances are twenty camels and she camels, whose loftiness of position touches the heaven and lowers it\". Read Muhammad\\'s(uwbp) history of emigration to medina and see this prophecy being fulfilled. No Hindu explanation of this exists as to my knowledge. [Atharva Veda 20:129]\\xa0', 'These are claims found on Zakir Naik’s website and they have been debunked extensively in forums like Hindustackexchange.\\n\\nNow I would give Zakir Naik a thousand dollars if he can name the difference between a Samhita, a Brahmana, an Aranyaka and an Upanishad, as well the structure of each school of Vedic recension.', 'No. He is not mentioned in the Vedas whatsoever.\\n\\nI mean they’re not even prophetic texts so why would he even by mentioned', 'Lose that \"friend\".', 'First things first, this seems to be based on claims made by Dr. Zakir Naik, who no one can reasonably claim to be an expert on Hindu shastras. Second, the references mentioned in the way they are are nonsensical. It would be very difficult to find the verses he is alluding to using those references. So first it is imperative to provide the original verse in sanskrit to make any reasonable debate regarding this matter.\\n\\nNow let\\'s dive into the points laid out here. For the first two points, the same reference is given, which is not traceable using the structure of the reference given. The point asserts that the verses were mistranslated/misunderstood. With the scripture being so old, and so many commentaries having been written on it, and many debates having happened, and many interpretations having been extracted, not once have any of the great thinkers and philosophers of Hinduism made this claim of an Ahmed in that verse, or else it would be something that we would be hearing about much more.\\n\\nNow let\\'s address the third point. The reference given does not say that. The english translation by Ralph T. H. Griffith says this: \"These our libations, strength inspiring Soma draughts, gladdened thee in the fight with Vritra, Hero-Lord, What time thou slewest for the singer with trimmed grass ten thousand Vritras, thou resistless in thy might.\" And if you read the rest of that hymn, then you will realize that his understanding of the verse is a faulty abstraction due to baseless knowledge of sanskrit.\\n\\nNow let\\'s address the fourth point. The Rigveda reference given does not prophesize Muhammad. The word is Sushravas, not sushrama. Sushravas was a king, and he is the subject matter of the verse. The english translation of this reference by Ralph T. H. Griffith is as follows: \"With all-outstripping chariot-wheel, O Indra, thou far-famed, hast overthrown the twice ten Kings of men, With sixty thousand nine-and-ninety followers, who came in arms to fight with friendless Susravas.\" Here he is again putting his own definition into the word and drawing a conclusion that is way off-course.\\n\\nNow the final point. Once again we have a faulty reference in which he does not even mention the name of the purana he is referencing. Nonetheless, he is referencing the Bhavishya Puran. It\\'s important to know the structure of the Bhavishya Puran and the problems it has. Being thought of as a prophetic shastra, many people have added to it over the years to make it seem that certain things were foretold a long time ago. Wikipedia explicitly says, \"The \"prophecy\"-related third part Pratisargaparvan includes sections on Christianity, Islam, Bhakti movement, Sikhism, Sultanate history, Mughal history, British rule, and others. This part is considered by scholars as a 18th– to 19th-century creation.\" giving reference to scholarly articles. So to say that the verses mentioned are canon is nonsense.\\n\\nOne more point to make is that articles similar to this also mention that there is an Allopanishad (Allah-Upanishad). But the list of the 108 official Upanishads does not mention this and is considered to be a creation of the Mughal Era. Dayanand Saraswati does not consider it an Upanishad as it does not exist in the Atharvaveda (from which it is claimed to be, or any of the other Vedas). So that argument is baseless as well.\\n\\nSo, please fact check before believing nonsense like this. Even fact checking it a little, following the references to make sure they hold up, goes a long way, and would be helpful. Posing the question here is beneficial to many, but it causes unnecessary dialogue. Nonetheless thank you for coming here to find your answer.', 'Dude atleast ask for the source written in sanskrit.\\n\\nDesert cult retards think anywhere \"अहम्\" is written it could be interpreted as Ahmed.', \"These sort of textual tampering attempts happen within the sects of Hinduism as well.\\n\\nEven a supposed Advaitin, in a discussion from a few months back, tried to equate the Abrahamic understanding of God to that of Brahman, right here in this sub.

These are some common questions that people have.\\n\\n1. Why do I need to study the Vedas?\\n2. Is a guru really necessary?\\n3. Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\\n\\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\\n\\n>tadviddhi praṇipātēna paripraśnēna sēvayā |  \\n>  \\n>upadēkṣyanti tē jñānaṁ jñāninastattvadarśinaḥ || 4.34||  \\n>  \\n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus? How do know that am not a guru?', '[deleted]', 'Very great post, and finding a Guru is one of the most valuable steps a seeker can take.\\n\\nAn important point is to not to treat acceptance of a guru casually and make a quick decision(something which happens a lot these days, sometimes followed by regrets). This is much more important than even something like marriage, and it is not considered good to leave and accept another person as Guru.  The student is usually encourage to spend some time testing and only when convinced at heart,  to commit to someone as Guru and be fully dedicated to their teachings.\\n\\nAlso, we need more guidance about sadhanas that somebody who hasnt yet found their Guru can do, how to find sadhanas which get you close to the Guru principle/tattva,  like Guru Gita, stotras to Dattatreya or Dakshinamurty,', 'Thank you for writing!', 'Indeed satsang (company of learned people) is very helpful.

And there Karna put up with Drona, for the purpose of learning arms.And that powerful youth contracted a friendship with Duryodhana. And having acquired all the four kinds of weapons from Drona, Kripa, and Rama, he became famous in the world as a mighty bowman. And after having contracted a friendship with Dhritarashtra\\'s son, he became intent on injuring the sons of Pritha\" - Mahabharata Adi Parva CCCVII. \\n\\nTruth - Then when was he rejected by Drona? \\n\\n\"Karna. one day approached Drona in private and said these words unto him, \\'I desire to be acquainted with the\\xa0Brahma\\xa0weapon, with all its\\xa0mantras\\xa0and the power of withdrawing it, for I desire to fight Arjuna......Thus addressed by him, Drona, from partiality for Phalguna, as also from his knowledge of the wickedness of Karna, said, \\'None but a Brahmana, who has duly observed all vows, should be acquainted with the\\xa0Brahma\\xa0weapon, or a Kshatriya that has practised austere penances, and no other.\\'\" - Mahabharata Santi Parva Section II\\n\\nSo he was rejected when he asked for Brahmastra. And the reason is clear - he asked it in order to fight Arjuna. He is jealous and also Drona was partial to Arjuna (and his son) so he rejects. It is then that he goes to Parasurama and lies that he is Brahmin, possibly also because Drona said only Brahmin and Kshatriya that have observed all vows can learn. We must remember that it is only Arjuna that reached the highest extent, hence proving that austerity, humbleness, service to preceptor are most important qualities to obtain higher knowledge. \\n\\n(2) Karna met Duryodhana for the first time in Rangbhoomi - The above passage answers this. He knew Duryodhana from Gurukul days itself. Moreover he was involved in the poisoning of Bhima. His enmity with Pandavas started from Gurukul days not from Rangbhoomi. \\n\\n(3) Karna tried to prevent Cheerharan - No, he was the one who started it. \\n\\n\"And at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by anger, waving his well-shaped arms, said these words,--\\'O Vikarna, many opposite and inconsistent conditions are noticeable in this assembly... Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the attire of Draupadi.\" - Mahabharata Adi Parva Section LXVII\\n\\n(4) Karna was rejected by Draupadi in Swayamvar - Actually only few editions, like 4 out of 1000, mention this. It\\'s an interpolation. Even the editions that mention that he was rejected, later when Dhrishtadyumna is wondering who can win the contest now that powerful kings have failed thinks \"Shalya and Karna both failed how can anyone else win?\", Clearly showing inconsistency. \\n\\nThe BORI critical edition , made after researching different versions, omits the part where she rejects him. Even Sri Madhvacharya boldly declared in 13th century itself that Mahabharata is interpolated heavily and then wrote Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya. Here he too writes that Karna missed the target and later Arjuna wins it - no mention of rejection of Karna by anyone. So on strength of Acharya\\'s words and also research we know it\\'s a later insertion. \\n\\n(5) Draupadi insulted Duryodhana as blind son of blind man - this is not in any edition. This is just from BR Chopra serial. \\n\\nThe Sanskrit version doesn\\'t really mention her specifically. Neither does Bhagavatam, it just says the ladies laughed. Andhra Mahabharatam and some other versions says the Pandavas laughed and then Draupadi and other ladies also laughed. But it\\'s just laughing which was quite natural, seeing everyone was doing that and it was indeed funny. It wasn\\'t mean-spirited, Duryodhana was too proud and hence he took it in wrong light. \\n\\nSerial wanted to spice up matters by adding a dialogue like that, but it maligned her character as a haughty woman. \\n\\n(6) Draupadi was a haughty woman - She is the one who forgives the killer of her sons Aswatthama and asks Pandavas to spare him, so no way. There is no instance where she is proud at all. \\n\\n(7) Ghatotkacha was a noble and virtuous person - This is because of folk tales. Indeed he did help out the Pandavas and Draupadi during their exile, and he served his father and stepmother well. \\n\\nYes Bhagavan Krishna was the only one cheerful when he died and also one reason was so that Arjuna is saved from Karna\\'s Vasava Shakti. But the other reason He mentions,\\n\\n\"If Karna had not slain him with his dart in great battle, I myself would have had to slay Bhima\\'s son Ghatotkacha. From desire of benefiting you, I did not slay him before. That Rakshasa was inimical to Brahmanas and sacrifices. Because he was a destroyer of sacrifices and of a sinful soul, therefore hath he been thus slain. O sinless one, by that act as a means, the dart given by Sakra, hath also been rendered futile. O son of Pandu, they that are destroyers of righteousness are all slayable by me. Even that is the vow made by me, for establishing righteousness. Whither the\\xa0Vedas\\xa0and truth and self-restraint and purity and righteousness and modesty and prosperity and wisdom and forgiveness are always to be met with, thither I myself always remain.\" - Mahabharata Drona Parva Section CLXXXI\\n\\n(8) Krishna is just a man in Mahabharata except for Gita, Bhagavatam made Him a God. \\n\\nThis is the most laughable myth. Because every stanza of Mahabharata describes Him as God! I\\'ll just give one but literally there are innumerous references. In Ramayana itself there are so many references to Sri Rama\\'s divinity but in Mahabharata there are many many more. \\n\\nTwo main ones. Bhishma declares this in entire Sabha of all the kings of India and front of Devas also during Rajasuya Yajna. And Markandeya Rishi who personally met Bhagavan Narayana tells Yuddhishtira about Narayana and at the end says \"The Krishna you have with you now is that same Narayana \" and instructs him to worship Him. \\n\\nEven Duryodhana knew. Dhritarashtra is told this and that no one can win over Krishna. So he gets fearful and tells Duryodhana to stop fighting but Duryodhana says that he knows all this and that he can\\'t win but that still he needs to, he can\\'t stop himself, the anger against Pandavas is too great. Then Dhritarashtra curses his fate. \\n\\nThese are it for now! Doubts about any other incidents? Let me know! \\n\\nAdditional -\\n\\n(1)  Pandavas went to hell and Duryodhana went to heaven - that is just a vision. Why would Pandavas, the close friends of Krishna, go to hell? Krishna, who is declared as \"krishnam dharmam sanatanam\"? \\n\\nThe various abodes they reached are described in Mahabharata. Arjuna reaches Vaikuntha and is shown to be sporting with Krishna there. So no Pandavas did not go to hell. The Swarga Duryodhana went to is temporary as the Gita declares, it\\'s not a permanent abode of bliss like Vaikuntha. \\n\\n(2) Shakuni was motivated by revenge - Interesting tale but no factual basis. It is not mentioned in Mahabharata, \\n\\n\"the chaste Gandhari hearing that Dhritarashtra was blind and that her parents had consented to marry her to him, from love and respect for her future husband, blindfolded her own eyes.\\n\\nSakuni, the son of Suvala, bringing unto the Kurus his sister endued with youth and beauty, formally gave her away unto Dhritarashtra. And Gandhari was received with great respect and the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp under Bhishma\\'s directions. And the heroic Sakuni, after having bestowed his sister along with many valuable robes, and having received Bhishma\\'s adorations, returned to his own city.\"\\n\\n- Mahabharata Adi Parva Section CX. \\n\\nShakuni\\'s brothers are killed in Kurukshetra by the Pandavas, so no way they all died in a dungeon. He just loved his nephew and hence supported him. \\n\\n(3) Shakuni was a master strategist and rivalled only by Krishna, he planned everything - I don\\'t recall any instance where he really did that much. I can only remember him driving the game of dice forward but otherwise it was mostly Karna and Duryodhana taking decisions. Shakuni seems to be the most moral out of the \"evil 4\" in fact. \\n\\nNeither does he seem like a master genius anywhere, he was definitely a master dice player and was smart . But  his intelligence is overblown. I don\\'t recall any super genius plan of his, and definitely Mahabharata is not just a chess game between Krishna and Shakuni like people think. He was nowhere near Krishna. \\n\\nAdmittedly I can\\'t recall other genius plans, I\\'d like to know if there is any story that shows Shakuni plotting. \\n\\n(4) Arjuna hated Karna - The rivalry was more one-sided. Karna wanted to prove himself as the best warrior and better than Arjuna. Narada Muni says that there aren\\'t warriors that can beat Arjuna and Karna implying that they are the best, hence Karna wanted to prove himself better than Arjuna and built up hatred and jealousy for that reason from schooldays itself. \\n\\nBut Arjuna did not really hate Karna. He was indifferent. He only focused on bettering his skills. When Bhima takes the vow that Arjuna shall kill Karna in Kurukshetra after Vastraharana is probably when his anger starts. Even then it\\'s not such an intense feeling from his side - he definitely is angry at Karna but the intense rivalry is more from Karna\\'s side.\\n \\n(5) Krishna is a morally gray character - No, in fact He and Vyasa Mahamuni (I would add Vidura too) are the whitest characters morally. It is known to everyone that where there is Dharma, there is Krishna and that where there is Krishna there is Dharma. Hence even the Kauravas showed respect before the war. Krishna was immensely respected and it was known that He is always, always on the side of Dharma. \\n\\nNot once did He transgress morality or the words of the scriptures, in fact when He is reviving Parikshith one of the statements He says is \"If I have never told a lie, let this child be revived\" . So definitely He never lied. \\n\\n(6) Krishna is bound by Karma, that is why He could not escape Gandhari\\'s curse - Krishna is free to do whatever He wants. Not just Him, no jnani is bound by Karma, He declares this emphatically in the Bhagavad Gita which is found in Mahabharata. Second, it is not that He can\\'t escape Gandhari\\'s curse - \"Krishna suffered it to take place although he was fully competent to baffle it. Govinda was able to alter the very course of the universe with all its mobile and immobile creatures. What need then be said of the curse of even high-souled Brahmanas? \" - Veda Vyasa Mahamuni says this in Mausala Parva Section VIII. \\n\\n\\n\\nJai Sita Rama', 'This needs to be pinned.\\n\\n\\nPlease add your insights on Duryodhan and Shakuni that you previously shared in my question a few months ago.\\n\\n\\nI recently discovered that Shakuni asks Duryodhan to stop obsessing, to which Duryodhan threatens to commit suicide (emotional blackmail) to enlist Shakuni.\\n\\nJai Shri Ram!', 'very informative. thanks.', 'Mahabharat is history of India. There are no myths. It’s not a mythology', \"This is great. I would like to add.\\n\\nWhen the laughing at duryodhana episode happens, acharya madhva writes that Krishna started laughing first, then bhima, then draupadi and everyone else.

How to administer a kingdom that large and how to spread dharma. In this council all the kings, Krishna, narada and other great people were attending. *Duryodhana, who got a formal royal invitation, staggered in drunk out of his mind and late.* He also slipped and fell because he couldn't even walk properly because of the intoxication. The reason krishna laughed was to bring an end to him.\\n\\narjuna never talked about killing karna till he took part in the disrobing of draupadi. Arjuna got the various astras from Drona because he had won over the negative faculties and had conquered himself. krishna loved him because of that. Karna wanted the astras to be in the good graces of duryodhana and to be the one to kill arjuna. In fact, the sadhana of arjuna for the role had started before his being born as arjuna. The gandiva bow wielding boon, he had done tapas before and gotten it. Arjuna is indra himself with avesha of nara form of krishna.

That is 'worry' samadhi. There is no cognition of surroundings, just a blank stare. Or we might be engrossed in a book, caught up in a game, or intently watch a movie.

Dhyana and samadhi aren't possible with external objects because they keep changing. When the dharana is put to the truth, then it intensifies into dhyana and culminates in samadhi. Dharana is basically where there is you and your object of concentration. Dhyana is where there is no you, only the object of concentration. Concentration has now deepened into meditation. And samadhi is where even the object of concentration is not there. Only the distilled truth remains. This isn't possible with normal objects of the world, it requires some divine support such as the ishta devata. The point is not to concentrate the mind in selfish pursuits, but rather concentrate the mind on a universal truth or symbol of the truth like Om or the ishta devata. This concentration is not like the narrow minded and focused concentration of playing a game or reading a book, but is a very broad and encompassing concentration where you are concentrating on everything at once, per se, because you're concentrating on the symbolism of consciousness itself. And consciousness precedes all movement of mind. Hence, what you're describing is dharana. Where there is you and you focus on something.

Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point. Till we attain moksha which is the same as realizing that we are eternally Brahman, the normal rules of morality, human ends, meaning etc all apply. \\n\\nTo give an example, we all know that the world is made of fundamental particles of various kinds. However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels. All this everything is me etc is just a vessel to carry you to the truth and the vessel has to be abandoned one day, too. Like a boat, incredibly useful - to the other side of the river, then you abandon it and walk.\\n\\nWe use a thorn analogy, we use a thorn (advaita vedanta) to remove another thorn (human suffering) and then we discard both.\\n\\nAll this I am consciousness and everyone is me, etc etc will be refined and transformed. There is no I, consciousness is not an I. The I is the ego it\\'s ahaṃkara and consciousness is something completely different. The fact you can see the object of I-ness is proof it is not pure consciousness.\\n\\nReality is nondual, it\\'s not perceivable unless you\\'re using a mind to have transactions but the mind will limit you to a perspective of reality that is from the point of view of the mind. Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing. This disqualifies it\\'s classification of being nihilistic. Since nihilism has a \"no point\" sort of feel, and in Vedanta we believe existence is the point. Vedanta adds meaning to life, it doesn\\'t remove it.', 'What you said isn\\'t true for just Advaita Vedanta, it is true for all of Vedanta. The point that \"whatever I do is a barrier for moksha\". While it is true that the perception of \"being the only conscious being\" is not exactly the best way to word Advaita, still what you said is shared by all schools of Vedanta. \\n\\nI was going to give you a detailed answer backed up from Bhagavad Gita. But, Vashishta Muni already has answered this question when teaching Bhagavan Sri Rama. Hence it seems best that he should answer your doubt as well directly. \\n\\n[Refutation of Fatalism - Yoga Vashishta](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/yoga-vasistha-english/d/doc118039.html)\\n\\nYou can read the preceding 5 chapters to get an understanding of the basis for it if you wish.

Because if the question was asking for parallels between Buddhism(shoonyavad) and nihilism it would just be an ordinary philosophy class question.\\nBut the fact that the two, Advaita Vedanta and Nihilism might have some parallel, even such confusion is an insight.\\nAnd I would like to consider them one by one, so to start with Advaita Vedanta, I would like to quote a phrase from Adi Shankaracharya, \\n\"Brahman Satya Jagat Mithya, Jeevo Brahmaiv Na Parah.\"\\nThis translates to Brahman alone is real, the universe(or world) is unreal, and the individual self is no other than Brahman itself(the supreme self).\\nFor nihilism, I would like to define it as the following \"extreme scepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real existence.\"\\nSo the common thing between them is the negative value ascribed to the existence. \\nBut nihilism only ends there and has no other conclusion to draw from this fact.\\nWhile Advaita Vedanta, though says the world is unreal, but it has a conclusion, or an assertion to make regarding the reality of the individual. So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings. This is ego, made possible by mind and the senses, powered by intellect. \\n\\nThere are two ways I can describe our situation-\\n\\nA. Video game  \\nB. Dream\\n\\nIn all this \\'video game\\' we are a part of, we often forget ourselves, playing hours and hours (lives), initially remembering ourselves, but just for fun. Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives. He stabs you in the chest and you see that another person was watching impassively neither helping you nor the other guy. Now you wake up. Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan. You and the countless others before you and after you are the same, parts of dream of Vishnu. Now, you might think, why should I suffer for his Leela? He ain\\'t paying my emi nor helping me deal with office politics. But remember, in your dreams of fear and pleasure, everything was in your head, you imagined juvenile things with your latest crush or saving the world with iron man.

(And they refer to God/Bhagavant as “him”, like a personalized concept, not an abstract one.)\\n\\nDo Hindus actually talk about “God” in that way, and do they use the word “Bhagavant” for him?

Bhishma, the grandfather of the Kurus, having heard this, sent messengers unto the king of Gandhara. King Suvala at first hesitated on account of the blindness of the bridegroom, but taking into consideration the blood of the Kurus, their fame and behaviour, he gave his virtuous daughter unto Dhritarashtra and the chaste Gandhari hearing that Dhritarashtra was blind and that her parents had consented to marry her to him, from love and respect for her future husband, blindfolded her own eyes.\\n\\nSakuni, the son of Suvala, bringing unto the Kurus his sister endued with youth and beauty, formally gave her away unto Dhritarashtra. And Gandhari was received with great respect and the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp under Bhishma\\'s directions. And the heroic Sakuni, after having bestowed his sister along with many valuable robes, and having received Bhishma\\'s adorations, returned to his own city. And, O thou of Bharata\\'s race, the beautiful Gandhari gratified all the Kurus by her behaviour and respectful attentions.

Given that you're talking about mass destruction and what-not, that could potentially be understood in that light - destruction is not necessarily a bad thing, not at all, but rather a catalyst for transformation and new growth.

My perspective of Hinduism (You're allowed to have it). The whole universe is divine incl. us and all the intergalactic dust. Every atom recycles itself into something all the time in this universe. So it applies to one's soul(if you believe in soul anyway), it recycles once the carrying body is dead. So rebirth. The divine Brahman's body is all the matter in the universe and it's soul is God(conscience). Just like our body is a part of our universe, our soul is part of the collective conscience. Each soul has individuality and in order to reach God, it should have 0 net karma. These are all my own understanding and may not agree with popular theories. Also since you are talking about space, you can use the above theory that every soul reincarnate to fulfil their Dharma(which is acheive 0 karma). But if the carrier planet(Earth) is destroyed, the souls which has to be reincarnated will reincarnate in other planets with life. Intergalactic Hinduism.

He never asked for any wish or boon from Sri Krishna. When Krishna was at the verge of completing His Avatar, he called Uddhava and said,‘ Dear Uddhava, in this avatar of mine, many people have asked and received boons from me; but you never asked me anything. Why don’t you ask something now? I will give you. Let me complete this avatar with the satisfaction of doing something good for you also.’  \\n>  \\n>Even though Uddhava did not ask anything for himself, he had been observing Krishna from his childhood. He had always wondered about the apparent disconnect between Krishna’s teachings and actions, and wanted to understand the reasons for the same. He asked Krishna, ‘Lord, you taught us to live in one way, but you lived in a different way. In the drama of Mahabharat, in the role you played, in your actions, I did not understand many things. I am curious to understand the reasons for your actions. Would you fulfil my desire to know?’  \\n>  \\n>Krishna said, ‘Uddhava, what I told Arjuna during the war of Kurukshetra was Bhagavad Gita. Today, my responses to you would be known as ‘Uddhava Gita’. That is why I gave this opportunity to you. Please ask without hesitation.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava starts asking – ‘Krishna, first tell me who is a real friend?’  \\n>  \\n>Krishna says, ‘The real friend is one who comes to the help of his friend in need even without being called.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava: ‘Krishna, you were a dear friend of the Pandavas. They trusted you fully as Apadhbhandava (protector from all difficulties). Krishna, you not only know what is happening, but you know what is going to happen. You are a great gyani. Just now you gave the definition of a true, close friend. Then why did you not act as per that definition. Why did you not stop Dharmaraj (Yudhishtra) from playing the gambling game? Ok, you did not do it; why did you not turn the luck in favour of Dharmaraj, by which you would have ensured that dharma wins. You did not do that also. You could have at least saved Dharmaraj by stopping the game after he lost his wealth, country and himself. You could have released him from the punishment for gambling. Or, you could have entered the hall when he started betting his brothers. You did not do that either. At least when Duryodhana tempted Dharmaraj by offering to return everything lost if he betted Draupadi (who always brought good fortune to Pandavas), you could have intervened and with your divine power you could have made the dices roll in a way that is favorable to Dharmaraj. Instead, you intervened only when Draupadi almost lost her modesty and now you claim that you gave clothes and saved Draupadi’s modesty; how can you even claim this – after her being dragged into the hall by a man and disrobed in front of so many people, what modesty is left for a woman? What have you saved? Only when you help a person at the time of crisis, can you be called ‘Apadhbandhava’. If you did not help in the time of crisis, what is the use? Is it Dharma?’  \\n>  \\n>As Uddhava posed these questions, tears started rolling from his eyes.  \\n>  \\n>These are not the questions of Uddhava alone. All of us who have read Mahabharata have these questions. On behalf of us, Uddhava had already asked Krishna.  \\n>  \\n>Bhagavan Krishna laughed. ‘Dear Uddhava, the law of this world is: ‘only the one who has Viveka (intelligence through discrimination), wins’. While Duryodhana had Viveka, Dharmaraj lacked it. That is why Dharmaraj lost.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava was lost and confused. Krishna continues ‘While Duryodhana had lots of money and wealth to gamble, he did not know how to play the game of dice. That is why he used his Uncle Shakuni to play the game while he betted. That is Viveka. Dharmaraj also could have thought similarly and offered that I, his cousin, would play on his behalf. If Shakuni and I had played the game of dice, who do you think would have won? Can he roll the numbers I am calling or would I roll the numbers he is asking. Forget this. I can forgive the fact that he forgot to include me in the game. But, without viveka, he did another blunder. He prayed that I should not come to the hall as he did not want me to know that through ill-fate he was compelled to play this game. He tied me with his prayers and did not allow me to get into the hall; I was just outside the hall waiting for someone to call me through their prayers. Even when Bheema, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva were lost, they were only cursing Duryodhana and brooding over their fate; they forgot to call me. Even Draupadi did not call me when Dusshasan held her hair and dragged her to fulfil his brother’s order. She was also arguing in the hall, based on her own abilities. She never called me. Finally good sense prevailed; when Dusshasan started disrobing her, she gave up depending on her own strength, and started shouting ‘Hari, Hari, Abhayam Krishna, Abhayam’ and shouted for me. Only then I got an opportunity to save her modesty. I reached as soon as I was called. I saved her modesty. What is my mistake in this situation?’  \\n>  \\n>‘Wonderful explanation, Kanha, I am impressed. However, I am not deceived. Can I ask you another question’, says Uddhava. Krishna gives him the permission to proceed.  \\n>  \\n>‘Does it mean that you will come only when you are called! Will you not come on your own to help people in crisis, to establish justice?’, asks Uddhava.  \\n>  \\n>Krishna smiles, ‘Uddhava, in this life everyone’s life proceeds based on their own Karma. I don’t run it; I don’t interfere in it. I am only a ‘witness’. I stand close to you and keep observing whatever is happening. This is God’s Dharma.’  \\n>  \\n>‘Wow, very good Krishna. In that case, you will stand close to us, observe all our evil acts; as we keep committing more and more sins, you will keep watching us.

We've got some great reviews coming in and I thought of sharing this with the community to get your thoughts and feedback as well.

You will go head-to-head with your opponent, spending valor (a finite resource) to dispatch warriors to the front-line to not only deal damage but also defend your life.\\n\\nAs in the ancient myths, each warrior has a chosen weapon, which when paired together award bonus powers. Divine scrolls, inspired by interesting characters and stories from the Hindu myths, award you with powerful bonus skills, extra valor, and deadly force to help you take down your opponent.\\n\\nMaha Yodha features exquisite traditional Indian artwork, or Pattachitra, as well as specially commissioned illustrations of celebrated warriors and weapons in a really modern style that is getting a lot of appreciation from reviewers.\\n\\nIf you're interested to see the campaign, go here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leprechaungames/maha-yodha-an-epic-new-card-game-4000-years-in-the\\n\\nThanks for reading!\\n\\nedit: We've just updated our campaign with a major change which should be of interest to you all!

(Actually, grandparenting) My wife and I were in Madurai Meenakshi temple a few years back. After taking darshan, we found a quiet spot to sit and watch, over in a corner back behind the Siva sanctum. (We are never in a hurry on such pilgrimages, preferring to take time to take it all in.) So eventually along comes an older man with his bright little granddaughter in tow. Obviously the two of them have come to the temple for some outing. She\\'s dressed for temple. As they approach us, her eyes get bigger as we sort of stand out, being white. It may be the first time she\\'s seen a white pair of devotees in traditional garb like we wear. As they get closer  it\\'s obvious she\\'s really curious. So I say, \"You speak English?\" \\n\\nLo and behold she does ... fluently.  The Granddad also does but not as well. But his years of experience allow him to shut up and let her talk. And she does, as do we. We discuss her favorite God, her favorite part of the temple, how often she comes, her family and why she come on Fridays with Appappa. She asks us where we\\'re from, how we became Hindu, what we think of India, and more. I\\'m guessing it\\'s half an hour or so. But the really impressive thing was the ability to parent by the man ... the patience, the smiles at watching his dear granddaughter and the opportunity. \\n\\nAnd it could have been so much worse. He could have tugged her away.\\n\\nAum', \"That's one of the most wholesome things I have read today. I appreciate the way you communicated with her, I'm sure she will remember that conversation throughout her life and would remember you forever! \\n\\nBy the way, what's your favorite God?

In America we often see so much seperation between traditional Hindus and converts, it's wonderful too see in the Holy Lands that people from different places in the world understand, love and be interested in each other's relationship with God and his Host.\\n\\nLord Shiva is our father, Lady Parvati is our mother, the disciples of Him are our family and all of the three worlds are our home!\", \"What's wrong with tugging her away?

It seems that if the world is just a game/joke/play, and people are an expression of Brahman all playing their various roles and getting lost in their act, then it would be difficult to be empathetic because none of it is serious, fundamentally. If someone is deeply lost in their role, it’s just a superb ability to lose one’s nature in the play.\\n\\nI have never studied Hinduism so my understanding of these concepts could be incorrect.

In fairness, most of my concepts line up with Hindu concepts; but I don\\'t think that\\'s conclusive.\\n\\nThere was a Shakta (Goddess-worshipper) named Ramakrishna who performed a couple of bold experiments. He embraced Islam, then came back and announced that Islam was also a way to God and resumed worshiping Kali. He then had an experience of Jesus, announced that Christianity was also a way to God and resumed worshiping Kali. But he had this to say about Jesus: that, not only was He an Avatar; He was \"the Redeemer of the world.\" And he honored Jesus to the end of his days.\\n\\nI think the truth is a lot stranger than we are often willing to acknowledge. Formal religion is all about theology and self-discipline; and these things have value, don\\'t get me wrong. But, fundamentally, religion is about knowing God; and God won\\'t be put in a box, no matter how hard we try.\\n\\nI come from a Christian background and upbringing. I have not considered myself Christian since 1993; yet I have never denied the divinity of Jesus. I have simply gone a different path. For myself, I find Ramakrishna\\'s testimony compelling. I think Jesus is special -- that there is something about Him, His life and His sacrifice that stands alone. That doesn\\'t mean I\\'m going to believe everything that is hung on him, like ornaments are hung on a Christmas tree; people hang ornaments on Christmas trees to please themselves, but the tree is the tree.\\n\\nI include Jesus in my personal pantheon; and Lalita doesn\\'t seem to care. I would go further on this, but not publicly. In any case, I wouldn\\'t worry. Love God, however you conceive of Her; the rest will take care of itself. :)\\n\\nEDIT: I forgot to mention something. Pope John Paul II -- an amazing guy, IMHO -- said (regarding Christians, of course) that it was possible to participate in Jesus\\' substitutionary atonement, i.e. for a Christian to suffer for another\\'s sins. Don\\'t you think that\\'s amazing? To have the opportunity to participate in the redemption of the world?\\n\\nI have read, in Hindu literature, that it is not possible to take on the karma of another person; but I think that\\'s wrong. I feel sure of it. Love breaks all the rules, and what is love but the total gift of self to another. I think that, if anything, is the defining characteristic of God: that She gives of Herself, constantly and completely. I think we were created in order for Her to have others to give Herself to. How can we not give our whole selves to others? We are all One, ultimately. Can we not suffer for others?

Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes. This then to us regular ppl appears as someone having a really really sh\\\\*tty life full of misery, suffering, etc. SO Karma indeed is the answer but there are nuances within that as well.', \"4. The creature experiencing the evil is an incarnation of God, taking on the pain for some reason that will be known later.\\n\\nExample: the Ramayana\\n\\nAlso, I don't really consider 2 or 3 to be reasons for evil to exist. They are just incidental side effects of 1: Karma.\", \"I would argue that a omnibenevelant God would do bad in the interest of good by helping us grow through suffering. As demonstrated by yin and yan, there is good in bad and bad in good. So I would extend your reincarnation point to growth within a single life, as well as over multiple life times.\\n\\nThe point of good and evil being illusionary is interesting. I understand its called illusionary as we as humans conceptualise everything and as we do our definitions are out of touch with the way things are, it's not actually saying that these things don't exist. This teaching is only calling for a deeper understanding into reality, such as, can evil be classed as inheriently bad if its nessesary for good to exist?\", \"I've never heard of this 'well known' argument. Shucks darn. Mystics don't argue.\", ',hank you for posting.', 'A DETAILED ARTICLE BY MAANOJ RAKHIT ON HINDU CASTE SYSTEM&#x200B;\\n\\n**The basics before you proceed**\\n\\nThere is something you may want to understand well before you proceed any further. If your slate/page is full you won\\'t have any place to write on it until you clean it up well. Similarly, your mind, your thoughts, your emotions —almost your whole being—is covered with a blanket. This blanket is made of primarily three components - your religion, your education system and media around you. Using (or abusing) the Media (the immensely powerful tool that it is) you are constantly being bombarded with what you *should know*. These *invisible shackles* are too demanding to let you lose. \\n\\nYou may think that you are free to form your independent opinion—almost about anything—but the truth happens to be otherwise. You are also constantly reminded that you are making an informed choice but the reality is opposite. You never realize that you are always being fed with selective information. Your religious guides tell you what they want you to know. Much the same is the case with your educators and your media. Your psyche formation —right from your childhood through adolescence to the adulthood—takes place under their guidance. And, my objective is to break that cordon of cultivated misinformation, and the resultant ignorance.\\n\\nWhen an Untruth is repeated thousand times it begins to sound like truth. When it is repeated hundreds of thousands of time it becomes The Truth, and the real truth becomes the Untruth. Your school textbooks are the best tool to achieve this fate. From the very childhood your brains are washed thoroughly leading you to a make believe world of which you have no direct experience because it relates to that Past where \"you\" were not Present!\\n\\nYour direct experiences of today (if any) are projected as the direct outcome of that remote past of which you have no true experience, except whatever you may have been told via your textbooks, your religious guides, and media stories. Guides of organized religions have their own agenda that itself guides their thought and action, and based on that they guide the thoughts and actions of their followers. Contents of educational textbooks and media coverage get widely influenced by the images that their religious guides have helped them form over generations. If there remains any question of doubt it is duly taken care of by those who control things from behind the scene, the very support system which regulates breathing of educational institutions and media outlets (that is the inflow of finances and the power centers). \\n\\nThe repetition which has carefully shaped the untruth as truth can only be neutralized by equal amount of repetition. And therefore, you must not frown upon any repetition in my works, though they are often not verbatim repetitions. You may as well enjoy reading them. 25-10-2007\\n\\n**On gross social injustice in form of caste system**\\n\\nSome of you may have read *Seed-2* and some of you may not have. I receive plenty of feedback from my readers and I know that most often people do not get on hand the first book first. They get at random one of the books from someone and start reading it. It simply does not happen that they have access to all my works so that they can read them sequentially. Hence, those who have not read *Seed-2*, for them, the following section will be helpful. And for those who may have read *Seed-2*, for them, it may serve as recapitulation. Some arguments may be common with *Seed-2* and some not—to support the same case a different logic may have been used.\\n\\n*When you think of Caste system you think of gross social injustice towards a very large section of Hindu society. And Hindu Braahman is said to be the main culprit behind this injustice. This theory has been so well propagated that people today simply find no need to apply their mind. Just like any other superstition or blind faith they believe in this theory. Whenever any such propaganda driven theory is popularized with purpose, there is always some hidden beneficiary. Who all were those—that I have discussed elsewhere—I wouldn’t want to get sidetracked here—so let us stick to the point.* \\n\\nHindu society’s foundation was based on 4-Varn System: Braahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shoodr Varn. 16th century Christian missionaries coined a new term for this: Caste system. 19th century fiercely-Christian T B Macaulay introduced Christian Missionary driven English Education System by systematically eliminating Ancient Hindu Education System in BhaaratVarsh. Christian educators slowly poisoned the minds of unsuspecting Hindu children against Braahmans. 20th century Nehru dynasty pampered Marxist-fake-Secularist educators who continued the process with greater enthusiasm. Education system, newspapers, magazines, cinema, every possible media was used. With continued repetition every one came to believe that Hindu society practiced gross social injustice in the name of Caste system. Now look at these documented testimonies that give you a totally opposite picture. These testimonies were carefully kept out of your view for long, though they existed all along! You must read them and ask yourself a question— \\n\\n*Can the foundation of Hindu society be based on gross social injustice when ‘justice and truthfulness’ has been the lifeblood of the Hindu Society through the ages?*\\n\\nMax Muller filled 37 pages with examples of Hindu Justice and Hindu love for Truth and he said that he could go on quoting many-many more. To top it he titled the chapter as *Truthful Character of the Hindus* in his book *INDIA what can it teach us?* He categorically stated (p.50): \"Now, it is quite true that during the two thousand years which precede the time of Mahmud of Gazni, BhaaratVarsh has had but (\\\\*not) few foreign visitors, and few foreign critics; *still it is extremely strange that whenever,* either in Greek, or in Chinese, or in Persian, or in Arab writings, *we meet any attempts at* describing the distinguishing features in the national character of the Indians (\\\\*Hindus), regard for truth and justice *should always be mentioned first*.\"\\n\\nHe goes on to state (p.59): \"I have left to the last of the witness who might otherwise have been suspected—I mean the Hindus themselves. The whole of their literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth.\" \\n\\n*Now tell me—do you think a society could have all along practiced gross social injustice towards its own people, a society whose whole literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth?*\\n\\nAnd why does he say \"I have left to the last of the witness who might otherwise have been suspected\"? He knew that his audience (ICS aspirants at Cambridge University in England 1882) would think these were for talk not for practice. *Therefore, he cited numerous facts based on Hindu life style and conducts before he moved to Hindu literature so that his audience realizes that the teachings of Hinduism were truly reflected in the conduct of the Hindus—and that is the real test—the speech and action must corroborate, or else, it’s fake.*\\n\\nBefore Christ was born, 5th Century, Greek physician Ktesias dedicated in his works a special chapter on Justice of the Hindus. *Hindu Justice could not have been exemplary to Greeks if Hindu social structure was truly based on a system of gross social injustice towards the vast majority of its own people.* *This is nothing but plain logic and you do not need vast degree of intelligence to understand it.* Nevertheless, let us proceed with (a) what other observers documented about the Hindu society over a period as large as two thousand and four hundred years and (b) *witness the kind of consistency those documentations reflect at.* \\n\\nBefore Christ was born, 4th Century, Greek Ambassador Megasthenes spoke of Hindu love for Truth and that no Hindu was a slave. *Now tell me, how is it that Megasthenes documented in 4th century BC that \"no Hindu was a slave\" in a society that is supposed to have practiced gross social injustice in form of infamous Caste system?* \\n\\nAfter Christ was born, 2nd Century, Greek Arrian the pupil of Epictetus said Hindus were never accused of lying. 7th Century Chinese Hiouen-thsang spoke of Hindu Straightforward Honesty and Never Unjust nature. *How is it that a society, accused of practicing gross social injustice towards its own people, has been praised by Hiouen-thsang putting it on record ‘with regard to justice, Hindus make even excessive concessions’?* \\n\\n11th Century Muslim Conqueror spoke of Hindu Justice, Good Faith, Honesty and Fidelity. *Once again, it has been said that ‘Hindus were naturally inclined to justice and never depart from it in their actions’. How could they have allowed social injustice of the kind they were accused of by Christian educators and Communist educators?* Ever wonder if they were educators by profession or professional liars? *What was their objective? Did they want Hindu children to get cut off from their mainstream religious and cultural base and begin to look for alternative with (a) Christianity in ChristianBritish days (b) with Communism/Marxism in so-called post-independence days?*\\n\\n13th Century Italian Marco Polo spoke of **Hindu Braahmans** as the most Truthful, for they would not tell a lie for anything on earth! *Now ask yourself, who have been lying all along? These people from different origins, from different centuries, who came and visited Hindus and came to invariably the same conclusion? Or, Christian missionaries who had the hidden agenda to convert Hindus into Christianity by hook or crook? Or, Communist-Marxist historians of AMU and JNU who had a hidden agenda to spread their wings so they could keep their illegitimately acquired hold over Hindu society?* All fraudsters have a brotherhood kind of feeling and they support each other. This is what these Christians and Communists had been doing but simpleton Hindus did not see through their foul play. Wake up my Hindu nation and try to understand their game plan. \\n\\nOn the other hand, only three centuries later, the Saint of Christianity named Francis Xavier of 16th century (we will soon see what other people of 16th century have to say) calls Hindu Braahmans as perverse, wicked and crafty men and terms all Hindus as unholy race (Seed-5). Such happens to be the character of a Saint of Christianity. So, you can well imagine what would be the character of the lesser ones than a Saint. *When their ulterior motives are not otherwise fulfilled, they resort to tarnishing the image of others, and in doing so they reveal their own ‘wicked and crafty nature’.* The same applies to the ChristianEnglish educated ChristianizedHindus, and CommunistMarxist thinkers who adopted such questionable methods to raise their own social status by fraudulently reducing others. And, on that premise they built their imaginary theory of so-called **Oppressive Braahmanism** so that they could discredit the Braahmans, and occupy their coveted position in the Hindu society which these characters were not worthy of. Using (rather abusing) their hold over administrative machinery and educational system, they filled Hindu children’s minds with the filth that the Braahmans practiced much despised caste system and untouchability to retain their own superiority and their hold over Hindu society. *In the process, they not only* *tarnished the image of Braahmans in Hindu society, but effectively persecuted Hinduism itself on a much wider scale.* Their motive was simple: convert the Hindus into Christians. Communists followed the lead and used the same technique. Their motive was equally simple: convert the Hindus into Communists/Marxists. \\n\\n13th Century Muslims spoke of Hindus Free of all deceit, violence and fear of death. *And, Hindu Braahmans have been accused by Christians and Communists for deceit and violence in form of gross social injustice!* The foundation on which the Christians and the Communists built their propaganda was the **imaginary** theory of Aryan Invasion (Seed-2) and establishment of so-called (imaginary) oppressive Braahmanism. *This in itself was a fraud against humanity, and deceit of high order. This crooked theory has caused immense harm to the humanity.* \\n\\n14th Century Friar Jordanus speaks of Hindus True in Speech and Eminent in Justice. *But same Hindus are accused of gross social injustice by our Christian educators and Marxist intellectuals.* Must you continue to respect these liars who committed social fraud on you? *Ask Hindus, ask yourself. Don’t you owe at least, that much to yourself?* How long do you wish to live under the spell of these crooks that taught you nothing but lie?\\n\\n15th Century Persian Ambassador spoke of Perfect Security that Merchants enjoyed in our country. *Hindu Kshatriyas fulfilled their duty not only towards their own people but also towards foreign traders and an average Hindu fulfilled his duty towards the society at large.* And, what have these crooks given you now after destroying the social fabric of Hindu society? \\n\\n16th Century Muslim Minister Abul Fazl spoke of Hindu Truthfulness, gratefulness, and unbounded Fidelity and Never flies from Battlefield type character. *This was true of every Hindu Kshatriya—when he left for the battle field his mother would tell him that \"the day has arrived for which Kshatraanis (Kshatriya women) breast fed their milk to their children and the time has come to repay that debt!\"* And, what these Christian educators have taught you all along, that, Hindus were so much divided all the time that they could not face the Muslims. Besides, lowering your self-esteem what else have they given you? Have they given you the knowledge that has benefited you, or have they cheated on you while maintaining a poker face all the while? 19th Century common Muslims spoke of Hindu Straightforwardness. Do you find any trace of straightforwardness in these Christian and Marxist educators? Why do you still continue to let them remain your educators? \\n\\nMax Muller compares legendary Hindu honesty with English and French, and finds it superior to the Europeans. He also mentioned that he can go on quoting book after book and you will find that no one ever accused Hindus of falsehood. *Think, my dear fellows, think, can the Truthfulness of this magnitude survive in a society allegedly ridden with social injustice? Or, the allegation itself has been fraudulent, and a fabrication with ulterior motive?* We will deal with those motives, in detail, in our other books. You will see from historical evidence that historical frauds have been so common with Christianity from its very inception that it has become the second nature of Christianity. 18th century Warren Hastings \\\\[India’s First Governor General 1774-1784\\\\] spoke of Hindus as Less prompted to Vengeance for Wrong Inflicted than any people on the face of the earth. This is probably the reason that Hindus continue to tolerate these fraudsters, who have perpetrated social fraud of such magnitude that they have destroyed a great civilization that lasted thousands of years until these crooks arrived on the scene. Expect me not to use better adjectives for them—they should be identified as they have been and as they are. Bishop Heber spoke of Hindus as more easily affected by kindness and attention to their wants and feelings than any people he ever met with. *This is probably the reason that Hindus respected Christianity looking at handful of honest Christians like these counted few.* \\n\\nElphinstone spoke of Hindus about their freedom from gross debauchery. *People who live a life of purity, they do not indulge into the kind of gross social injustice they have been accused of,* by Christian educators and communist educators. \\n\\nSir Thomas Munro, the eminent Governor of Madras, spoke that Hindus were not inferior to the nations of Europe and he was convinced that England had more to gain if Civilization became an article for trade between BhaaratVarsh and England. *Do you think Sir Thomas Munro would have said something like this if our Hindu society were ridden with social injustice of the kind these Christian and Marxist educators have told us, and told the world?* \\n\\nProf. Wilson spoke of better quality of Hindu Honesty at Calcutta Mint than other mints elsewhere in the world. *Do you think that the people who cannot have any social justice within their social framework can have people commonly as honest as indicated here?* \\n\\nProf. Wilson spoke of **Braahman Simplicity truly Childish**. *Do you think that these Braahmans could have been credited with such childish simplicity if they happened to be such dirty people, who were alleged to have created this treacherous caste system for their own benefit?* Look at the statement (see *Seed-5 Christianity in a different Light—Face behind the Mask*) of St. Xavier, which painted Braahmans as perverse and wicked. Look at his reason, which he himself described to the Society of Jesus. *Xavier could not convert many Hindus into Christianity. His ulterior motive was hurt. So, he painted Braahmans in such bad light. His successors did the same thing. Later day missionary educated Hindus parroted what their teachers had taught them. Realize that you have learned the falsehood from your Christian educators and you have spread that falsehood further through television serials, movies, newspapers, etc. Now you must stop and reverse that process, which you too are responsible to some extent but only as the pawns in the hands of those master conspirators, who fooled you and cheated you all along.* If anyone is to be despised, it is not **Braahmans** but these cheats called Christian educators and Communist-Marxist educators.\\n\\nColonel Sleeman has put on record that he had before him hundreds of cases, in which a man’s property, liberty, and life depended upon his telling a lie, and he refused to tell it. Max Muller then asks: Can many an English judge say the same? *Could our so-called wretched caste system and a socially unjust society have produced such truthful Hindus incomparable elsewhere?* Do you realize the significance of this sentence: Can many an English judge say the same? *By deductive logic, if the outcome was so great, then the foundation also had to be equally great. And, that foundation was the 4-Varn System.* People with vested interest speak against it. People of ignorance keep parroting the same. Today, if we do not see any trace of such legendary truthfulness amongst Hindus, it is because these Hindus have become Christianized-Hindus, under the very bad influence of six generation of English-Christian Education System, which Macaulay instituted as he wanted to Christianize the Hindus. \\n\\nMax Muller says that for past two thousand years Greeks, Chinese, Persian, Arabs, all described the most distinguishing feature of Hindu society as its regard for truth and justice, *but for two hundred years English-Christian education system taught Hindus that the most distinguishing feature of Hindu society was its social injustice in form of 4-Varn System, which they renamed as caste system.* Were these Christian educationists lying all along? *Was their lie part of a much bigger conspiracy against Hindu society? Was it to bleed Hindu society to death?* \\n\\nEnglish Merchants spoke that commercial Honor stood higher in India (BhaaratVarsh) than in any other country. Why we do not see any evidence of it today? *Is it because Christian educators have completely ruined the sense of ethics amongst Hindus? Educators, who themselves posses no ethics, what else can they pass on to their pupil?* *If they themselves were not truthful, then how could you expect to learn anything about justice from them?* \\n\\nYou must understand this basic fact: *if the foundation is* *based on fraud, its outcome will also be fraud. In this context, English-Christian education system’s foundation was based on fraud against Hindu society. Their purpose was ignoble. Their intentions were conspiratorial. There was simply no regard for truth and justice in their belief system. Therefore, they produced crops like themselves. Students of their education system, through next six generations, gradually continued to become fraudulent like their teachers. They lost regard for truth and justice that happened to be cherished Ethos of Hindu society until two centuries ago!* \\n\\nMax Muller wrote the whole of Hindu literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth. He expressed doubt whether in any other of the ancient literatures of the world you will find traces of that extreme sensitiveness of conscience which despairs of our ever speaking the truth. *Now, ask yourself a question. Here stood Hindu society which practiced truth and justice by thought, speech and action for thousands of years, and with consistency. Could there have existed, unnoticed by all concerned, the gross social injustice of such magnitude in form of the infamous caste system? Was it the brainchild of those conspirators, who converted into reality of today, something that was nonexistent in the days of which they spoke of?* \\n\\nMax Muller writes, Hindus may teach us at least one lesson of truthfulness, that is, truthfulness to ourselves. *What did Christian educators do? Instead of learning that truthfulness from Hindus, they destroyed the truthfulness of Hindus.* This is what you acquire from an Aasuric religion like Christianity. They have destroyed your sense of ethics, justice, truthfulness all that you ever valued. \\n\\n*If it was all so good for 24 centuries continuously, as documented in the testimonies of non-Hindu visitors to this Hindu land, then what went wrong in less than two centuries? The answer is simple. Keeping all factors constant, the only variable on the scene is the presence of Aasuric influence of Christianity, which has eclipsed the Hindu society.* \\n\\n**Braahmans were the poorest of all**\\n\\n*It generally takes longer to build than to dismantle! Not for centuries, but for millenniums,* ***Braahmans*** *played the exemplary role. They themselves lived as the poorest of the lot but raised rich morals among the rest in the society. And, ample evidence of such rich morals, as documented by many-many foreign visitors to this Hindu land over more than two millenniums, you have already seen.* Do you remember the legendry poor *Dronaachaarya* who could not buy milk for his only child *Ashwatthaama*? Do you remember poor *Sudaama* who could only carry few grams when he went to meet his childhood friend Shri Krishn? Do you remember the stories that you read during your childhood? Whenever the central figure of the story happened to be a Braahman, did those stories not begin as \"Once upon a time there was a poor Braahman\"? Can you remember any story \"Once upon a time there was a rich Braahman\"? Well, I would not be surprised if you manage to find me one of them created during past fifty odd years by one of those MarxistCommunist intellectual professors of JNU who have mastered the technique of fabricating history in connivance with their bedfellow AMU professors. You will find enough evidence of such historical fabrications in *Seed-1.*\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nNow I invite you to take a special note of the fact that all the testimonies that I have presented before, are \\n\\n• Not by people who had a specific mission \\n\\n• Not by people who subscribed to a single ideology \\n\\n• Not by people who were part of a single theology \\n\\n• Not by people who were in any way connected with each other by an invisible thread \\n\\n• Not by people who had any reason to carry any special leaning in favor of the Hindus \\n\\n• Not by people who could be accused by any stretch of imagination that they were working together towards building a specific image for the Hindus. What does this all convey to you?\\n\\nThe extraordinary character and integrity of Hindu society was incomparable in the recorded history of mankind, and therefore, I see no reason whatsoever to be defensive about our ancient 4-Varn System and try to explain it away apologetically in the manner many modern interpreters tend to do. *It is their own low self-esteem that makes them do so. Their knowledge is of no use if they cannot see through the game plan of those conspirators who have brought their self-esteem to this low level.* \\n\\n*It is our 4-Varn System that prevented extinction of Hindu society under thousand years of barbaric Islam invasion, whereas* financially supported (by Hindus) one-class (monk based) Buddhist society was totally wiped out from BhaaratVarsh on account of the same Islamic invasion. \\n\\nHindu Society that was known for its regard for Justice over two thousand years \\\\[5th Century BC-AD 19th Century\\\\]. *Such society could not have been practicing gross social injustice within its own framework. This is nothing but plain and simple logic!* \\n\\n**A message to the Braahmans** \\n\\nI am not a Braahman by birth. I have no personal interest in defending you. I am on the side of Dharm.

I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house.

Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred.

Or also in my case as a way to think about how fast exponential growth is (I am a math teacher)\\n\\nIt goes something like this:\\n\\nWhen the game of chess was invented in ancient India it became extremely popular through out the country.  In particular there was a king that was especially fond of the game and quite good at it.  He was so confident in his abilities he made a challenge to his subjects that if someone could beat him at the game he would grant them any prize that was in his power to give.\\n\\nMany people attempted to beat the king but all failed, until eventually a timid man came forward to take the challenge and actually ended up winning the game.\\n\\nThe king being very impressed with the man\\'s skill asked what the man would like for his prize and the man responded:\\n\\nWhat I want is this: on the first square of the chess board place one grain of rice, on the second square of the chess board place two grains of rice, on the third square of the chessboard place four grains of rice and so on doubling the amount of rice on each square until you get to the end.\\n\\nThe king laughed at the seemingly humble request and called to his assistant to fetch a bag of rice from the store room.\\n\\nHowever the Kings accountants quickly realized that the mans request was far from humble, because if we went on continuing to double the number of rice on each square by the time we got to the 64th square there would be 2^63 grains of rice, or 9,220,000,000,000,000,000  or 9.2 Quintilian grains.  Which is more rice then the entire planet could produce in a thousand years.\\n\\nWhen the king realized the blunder he made by accepting to give this to the man, the man revealed himself to be the Hindu god Krishna (If I remember correctly, I could be wrong about their name)  and Krishna told the king that he did not expect payment right away and could be paid over time.  And so to this day people still offer rice to the god as penance for the arrogance that he displayed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain I just like this story because it illustrates exponential growth and the idea of \"look before you leap\"  But I wanted to know if this story was actually part of Hindu tradition, if it was actually Krishna or a different god,  and if it is not a part of Hindu cannon is it offensive to tell the story this way?  Because I think it is kind of like poetic justice to have it end that way.\\n\\n\\nAny thoughts or comments are welcome, thanks!', 'Yes it is a part of Hinduism. The temple \"Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple\" was built based on this action of Sri Krishna.

Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\n--------\\n\\nThis is a tough question to answer.

Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\nIt makes me wonder:\\n\\nWhat does one gain if it is not a dream, if it is not an illusion? If something is \"just\" a dream, this implies that there is some sort of reality to which \"just\" cannot be applied. What is that? When you scrape this real world, what comes off in your hand? It\\'s more than experiences, so what is it? What is left over that makes this real world more real than the illusory world?\\n\\nIf the problem with the illusory world is that it doesn\\'t have a point, the real one must. What is that, and how does it differ from a set of experiences?', \"One answer is that it will still feel real to you. If a Godhead is dreaming it or not doesn't really change the reality of pain/sorrow/enjoyment.

Can you explain in any clear terms what the statement \"A dream in the mind of the Godhead\" even means and why we should think that this is what is the case?\\n\\nI am not aware of a single Hindu school that says we are a dream in the mind of a Godhead. And this is why you\\'re not having any luck, it\\'s a nonexistent position only found in new age books and video games. ', \"Krishna Consciousness What is Paradise? Would it be some kind of situation in which every desire is satisfied? That would be a hollow kind of joy, and anyway, there would always be some unavoidable conflict with others wanting different things. Actually to want some kind of immortality as an individual ego is something very shallow, true joy begins where false ego ends.\\n\\nSo a more sophisticated explanation is something like “Nirvana” as it is described by certain Buddhist schools, the complete destruction and dissolution of all ego. It is clear that false ego is the primary cause of suffering, with all of the subconscious games it plays keeping us caught up in empty fascination. Hence the contemplative techniques, meditative techniques, found in all serious forms of religion, which are designed to help us see through our own selves, to look within and see the face beyond the masks. *“Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes”*, said Carl Jung.\\n\\nYet there is something unsatisfying about this. Ego-Death is a kind of death after all. There is something fundamental to humanity, the desire to live, something about the experience of being human which makes us wary of annihilation, even if it be a form of peace beyond that of individual existence. There is a natural desire to live, to be a human being, even if *“life is suffering”* as Buddha taught. This instinct often leads us away from religion, into the life of the senses and worldly pursuits for gain, but it can also lead us to a more holistic, more total, conception of a Paradise.\\n\\nKrishna Consciousness begins with the notion that we are all originally servants of God, whose qualities are encapsulated and present in the name KRISHNA. To be liberated from suffering is to return to our original position as servants of God, rather than as servants of the senses and of our desires. As God is in every way perfect, serving God is therefore the highest form of bliss any soul can attain.  \\n\\nUntil we turn away from the material life and engage in the Devotional Service of Krishna, again and again we are cast into physical bodies in order to satisfy particular desires and in accordance with the results of our previous actions. Just as the body changes from youth to old age but the soul remains the same, so do we change bodies but remain the same spiritual spark of consciousness. Returning to our original position, seeking to again become servants of Krishna, is the way to freedom from this cycle of Death and Rebirth known as Samsara. Thus it is taught that through Devotional Service we will attain rebirth on one of the spiritual planets collectively known as Vaikuntha and continue forever serving Krishna in His presence.\\n\\nThis whole conception quite nicely synthesises the other two conceptions of Paradise as Eternal Bliss or Ego Annihilation. What’s more, Krishna Conscious philosophy also includes in itself these other forms of Liberation or Paradise, which it considers to be partial and temporary. The worshippers of Demigods after the death of this body go to different planets where fulfilling the desires of the senses is very easy, before eventually returning to earthly realms. The “Mayavadis” and Buddhists who seek Ego-Annihilation are dissolved in the light emanating from Krishna, also eventually redescending into material creation.\\n\\nWhat we must understand is that Krishna is not an abstract concept or some incomprehensible effulgence. He is a personality (Vigraha) possessing all opulences. Sat-Chit-Ananda; Eternity, Bliss, and Knowledge. He is the Supreme Personality, qualitatively the same as us but quantitatively superior.  We must understand that Eternal Joy is found in no longer serving the Ego but serving Krishna instead. Everyone must serve something, be it some sectarian religion, their country, their family etc., but the intelligent person takes to serving Godhead. After all, God is the source of all things, the source of all happiness. We simply must accept that we are not and shall never be God, nor shall we find any permanent joy outside of serving Him.  \\n\\nThis Yoga of Devotional Service, is known by the Sanskrit name of BHAKTI YOGA.\\n\\nVarious simple rules were put into place by Prabhupada, the founder of the Krishna Consciousness movement in the West, for those wishing to practise Bhakti Yoga. There are four Regulative Principles: 1) No Meat Eating 2) No Gambling 3) No Intoxicants 4) No Illicit Sex, which devotees of Krishna should strive to conform to. In general we must avoid those things which keep us bound up with material nature, identified with the material body rather than the spiritual soul.  \\n\\nFood should be offered to Krishna before being consumed in order to free us from the Karmic effects of it’s production. We should not eat meat, fish and eggs along with onions and garlic are also prohibited. To kill, even an animal, is against the laws of nature, and cow protection is a central pillar of Krishna Consciousness – after all, the cow is like our mother, giving us milk. In general asceticism proves useful in returning back to the spiritual planets, back to Godhead, but we should not be extreme:\\n\\n“*There is no possibility of one's becoming a yogi, O Arjuna, if one eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.” (Bhagavad Gita As It Is 6:16).*\\n\\nNonetheless it is quite possible to seek to serve Krishna even if we haven’t mastered the Regulative Principles, any efforts will bear fruit. Most importantly, and before everything else, it is necessary to chant the MAHA MANTRA:\\n\\nHARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE  \\n HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE\\n\\nThis Mantra, the Holy Name, is not quite like many forms of prayer. We are not asking for anything except to be the servant of Krishna always, there is no question of wanting money or material exaltation. The chanting of the Mantra is compared to a child crying for its mother. It contains all the potencies of Godhead in its transcendental sound vibration. People remark that it is not tiring to chant this mantra as some other mantras can become. Devotees in these times try to chant a minimum of sixteen japa (16 x 108) of this mantra each day, though in the past saints have chanted many more and a few still do today.\\n\\nThe chanting of Holy Name was widely popularized by the last Avatar of Krishna, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, in the 15th and 16th century. He was the “Yuga Avatar” of Krishna, giving the appropriate teaching for the present age. We are currently in what is known as Kali Yuga, the dark age of the cycle of four ages. In this age human life is shorter, there is more suffering, little spirituality or charity and many other negative symptoms.

This is even more so when the Vedantaic schools blossomed because of their excellent explanations and theories on the areas of the World, God and Soul. \\n\\nI personally admire 'Srila Prabhupada' as a master of Bhakti Shastra, I like to believe his statements like how you said,\\n>Don't do that\\n\\nare agreeing to my point here, but the Hare krishna people on the ground, which we meet and interact, they don't seem to have understood fully that message of Shrila.

This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe).

Do all Hindu traditions actually place importance on the Vedas?I always heard how the word Hinduism is actually a word of foreign origin and is not the real name of the religion, but the real name is Sanatana Dharma in which the different traditions have their basis in their Vedas. How much truth is there in this claim, and where does the term come from?\\n\\nI haven't read Balagangadhara's work that in-depth yet, so I probably have a few things wrong, but what I've read so far is that the concept of Hinduism itself is a colonial construct that was created by the British, and that the concept of Hindu traditions being united by following the Vedas is something that came later so that Hinduism could be a real religion and fit somewhat of an Abrahamic framework. Basically, Abrahamic religions are the only religions, while other forms of practices are traditions.\\n\\nDo all traditions that are classified as Hindu actually value the Vedas, even if it's just lip-service? If not, then what is the basis of the term Sanatana Dharma? Was the concept of Sanatana Dharma actually a thing or was it just an attempt to create a Sanskrit term for Hinduism?\\n\\nThere's a lot of rambling here, so hopefully this makes some sense.\", \"Hinduism did not evolve as a single religion or identity, so no matter what you call it, it will be whimsical. That said, it is a good idea to call ourselves Hindu because it affords a social and political and even economic classification that can be helpful to keep traditions alive and make sure people aren't being preyed on.\", \"To understand what Balu is saying, one first needs to be clear about two themes in discussions - One, we are not talking about the names whichever one you use.(At best, a name can give a hint some shared concept exists, but words can also cause confusion, we can be divided by a common terms with different meanings). Two, he is not saying that 'Hinduism was constructed in the 19th century'. This has been said by a lot of postmodernists etc. \\n\\nInstead the issue is something like this - imagine you have two board games with very different rules and players of board game 1 see board game 2 and because of surface similarities, try to understand it as a variant of game 1. So things which are not seen by game 2 players are seen by game 1 players and some of the basic themes which actually do exist in game 2 are missed.\\n\\nWhat about the game 2 players? Because of the language issue and need to fit into laws designed by game 1 players, another thing happens - either game 1 words are understood by game 2 players in terms of their own concepts while being unaware of their original meaning(ie Indians dont understand western ideas even when using western words for previously existing concepts, ex: 'religion' is understood as dharma), or alternatively, game 2 players lose access to their own previous understanding(unlike the former case, they might actually understand dharma as religion) due to growing up in a new educational environment and game 2 just seems strange and incomprehensible(game 1 rules dont really work for understanding game 2) - why would anyone play it?\\n\\nSo, this is not a question of definition. Imagine, if alien anthropologists discover the chess board game along with extensive records of games. One can easily just go around defining 'chess' in terms of surface features like white pieces and black pieces, the shapes of pieces, 'we have discovered a lot of diversity - in this part of the world, the knight piece  looks different' without developing any understanding. They need to develop a theory of what is going on and test it against extensive record of annotated games.(Slowly discovering piece moves, exceptional things like en passant, when the game ends and so on)\", \"Some Yoga traditions are slient.

Since when Hindus started considering themselves as distinct religious community 3 Usefulness of  definition based on Vedic scriptures. \\n\\n1\\n>  Basically, Abrahamic religions are the only religions, while other forms of practices are traditions.\\n\\nThat would depend on definition of term religion itself right?  Definition of religion has evolved amongst anthropologists in last couple of centuries from definition which was very narrow,  applied to only organised sects. At that time catholicism and various branches of protestants like Lutherans, calvinism, anglicanism were considered separate religions and concept of religious freedom and separation of state and religion etc evolved even though everyone was Christian at that time. Now definition has broadened to something like \\n\\n> Religion is any cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, world views, texts, sanctified places, ethics, or organizations, that relate humanity to the supernatural or transcendental.\\n\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion  It is important to use broad definition of religion and consider Hinduism, Chinese traditional religion, shintoism etc as religions because special legal and social status modern society accords to \"religions\" as opposed to non religious ideologies. Eg Legal sanctions against discrimination based on religion etc. Social sanctions against persecution of someone because of his religion. For example it is socially acceptable to say \"punch a nazi\". It is socially acceptable or even socially required to fire someone for being a nazi even if that person has done no crime ever, participated in no violence and has done nothing more than hold some flag in some rally. While same society takes pains to constantly remind everyone #NotAllMuslims even though Muslim texts contain intolerant statements about Jews and infidels and there are instances of large scale violence by Muslims throughout history. \\n\\n2\\nStart of thinking of Hindus as one religious community definitely precedes British.  You have saints like Kabir preaching unity of \"Hindus and mussalman\". Sikh gurus saying be neither Hindu nor mussalman. These statements etc only make sense if popular conception at that time thought of Hindus and Muslims as two distinct religious communities. Shivaji founding hindavi swarajya,  maratha polity writing letters which show anger at tipu sultan\\'s forced conversion of Hindus in faraway kerala region etc also suggest pan Hindu communal identity in opposition to mussalaman was already in place. Without opposition to Muslims also we see one text describing Hindu as \"worshipper of narayana etc devatas\" . In pre-Islamic times we see division between astika traditions and nastika traditions in philosophical discussions though for ordinary people that division probably wasn\\'t much important. \\n\\n3\\nReason for defining Hindu using \"vedic scriptures\"  (which include scriptures other than Vedas  which accept authority of vedas) is simply practical. All extant non vedic nastika traditions that is Buddhism, jainism and Sikhism have rejected label Hindu. While all other astika organised traditions who accept authority of Vedas call themselves hindu. That leaves lingayats and masses of people who call themselves Hindus but may never have heard of Vedas. While hindu-ness of lingayats is controversial issue. Most of common Hindus who don\\'t belong to any officially vedic sampradaya have beliefs and practices extremely similar to those described in vedic scriptures. It is simply practical to define Hindus using vedic scriptures while being mindful of spectrum of scriptural to folk Hinduism.

'God of universe' vs 'God of man' .If we were to hit a rod onto the surface of a flowing stream, the undivided flow of water seems momentarily divided into two streams. In the evening sky, the moment the first star appears and twinkles, the otherwise unending sky appears to have acquired a point of reference, quadrisected into four cardinal directions.\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0This material world too, in all its eternity, gets divided into two parts as soon as the star of human awareness starts twinkling.\\xa0 Dichotomies like the beautiful and the ugly, the fragrant and the malodorous, the melodious and the harsh to hear, the soft and the hard, the dear and the unpleasant, the good and the bad, the divine and the evil, and others emerge as soon as human need becomes the point of reference in this cosmos. All that humankind considers good, pleasant and helpful is one part of this world while all that is unpleasant, all that unfavorably or adversely affects human existence is the other part of this world. He who creates the good part is “God” while he who creates the bad part is the “Rakshas”, “Asura”, “Satan” or “Devil”. Accepting these elementary human sensibilities as the working criterion for understanding the usefulness, goodness or badness of the cosmos is quite unavoidable.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Our ancestors realised ages ago that it was impossible to count, analyse, characterize and qualify or quantify each and every living species and non-living entity of this immeasurable and unfathomable universe. Instinctively they chose to analyse the things and beings in the universe using the five senses humankind is gifted with- touch, sight, scent, hearing and taste. Now everything had one or more attributes one could, well, “sense”. For example, the rose was red by color, soft to touch and fragrant by scent. While a fruit was sweet or sour by taste, aromatic by scent, cool and wet to touch, with a certain appearance for the eyes. A cuckoo was black to see and sweet to hear. A breeze was cool or warm to feel (to “touch”) while a sea storm was frightening to hear, forceful to feel and salty to smell. Given the primitive times then, this very idea of using the five senses was a veritable leap of human ingenuity! They developed this thought process to call the five senses representatives of the Pancha Maha Bhootas (The Five Great Elements), namely Pruthvi (Earth or the solid state of matter), Aap (Water or the liquid state of matter), Tej (Fire, light energy or radiations), Vaayu (Wind, air or gaseous state of matter) and Aakash (Outer space, vacuum or the Great Void). Spiritually, they theologized that whatever conversation or dialogue we humans could have with the God of this universe was also through these five senses, hence they even developed the concept of the five-headed deities, like Pancha Mukhi Mahadev, Pancha Mukhi Hanuman or Pancha Mukhi Ganesha.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Just as the process of studying the universe and its objects and beings with our five senses was so natural and instinctive, so were the attempts at trying to figure out if there indeed was any psyche behind the very forces who could create this universe. These forces were deified and became objects of faith across ancient cultures. The thought that came forward was that by creating this bounty and abundance of natural wealth for human prosperity, Nature was indeed very kind-hearted and affectionate like a mother who provided for her children, us human beings. Nature was\\xa0Mother\\xa0Nature,\\xa0Mother\\xa0Earth,\\xa0Mother\\xa0Life, the Goddess “Srushti” or “Prakruti”, who tended to us her children. By psyche she was all that a mother could be- affectionate, loving and providing. This “faith” has only been reinforced from time to time by the gifts Mother Nature has been showering onto us from time and again onto humankind till today! Likewise the Creator was Father Creator, the powerful “Purusha”, who though so powerful was yet, by psyche, so kind, gentle, caring and compassionate that He laid the very seed of human existence and a habitat to sustain human life!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Truly, for the benefit, utility and happiness of humankind, the compassionate God has created nature with such meticulous paternal love! This sun, this ocean, how majestically big these Great Elements! But the kind God employed even them for the service of humankind. Just as a mother would keep cool sweet water filled up for her kids coming home from their play out in the afternoon sun, so does the “Sun-God”, using sunrays as suction conduits, suck up only the water sans the salt from the salty oceans thereby sparing the sweet water of the rivers – and then store up this distillate in heavenly reservoirs, making it tempting even to the Gods! Just imagine the control mechanism over this saltwater-to-Sweetwater conversion – only as much capacity is there in the sunrays for this conversion as is the water required in one year and only as much is the water storage capacity of the celestial reservoirs- the clouds. At the same time, the oceans are themselves not turned sweet, sparing our whole life from becoming tastelessly bland!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Look at the animals! They are of various calibers of intelligence and various specializations, as varied as the varieties of services humankind expected of them in the pre-industrial ages! The Gods taught the camels the art of eating desert thorns and going without water for days, adapting them to life in a desert habitat – and they became the ship of the desert, a lifeline for sustaining human life in the inhospitable harsh desert! And how swift is the horse! God has given him strength and forbearance to both gallop for hours and to manoevour in the midst of a pitched battle all the time balancing and bearing the weight of a human rider for hours. There are many examples of steadfast loyalty where horses have even sacrificed their life for their masters, like the horse Chetak who carried Rana Pratap to safety before dying of exhaustion. Yet God has not over endowed the horse with the intelligence to ride a human being instead. Take the dairy cow or buffalo - one just has to push dry grass from one end to get rich, creamy, fresh, life-giving milk in abundance from the other end. Really, how kind God must be to his human children for creating such a biochemical process as milk formation! What’s more - God endowed the same dairy cow or buffalo that produces milk with the ability to leave behind her own progeny, a reproduced copy, with the very same miraculous biochemical abilities to turn dry unpalatable inedible grass into sweet, creamy milk before she retires or passes away. A milk-vending machine that vends not just milk but also another milk-vending machine!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0One has to sow just one grain of wheat - and it turns into a plant producing more than a hundred grains! Just\\xa0one\\xa0mango – a divinely juicy, delicious, nutritious, pulpy fruit – but it comes with its own seed that if sown and nurtured, turns into a majestic tree that gives\\xa0hundreds\\xa0of juicy mangoes for generations of a human family, year after year. Not just that, the mango even appears by branch grafting, producing whole orchards after orchards of the noble fruit in veritable abundance! Rice, millet or other varieties of different foodgrains with different nutrient profiles and tastes grow in all sorts of climatic conditions – in each case, one gets a whole sack full from one single, sowed grain. The varieties of fruits- pomegranates, bananas, apples, figs, jackfruits, dates… from different climatic profiles follow the same law - just\\xa0one\\xa0sown seed supplies enough fruit for satisfying the needs of at least a small family! All sorts of tasty, nutritious vegetables grow by themselves when kind of “ordered” by the mere act of being sown – the Lord God made this possible for us his human children! Then there’s sugarcane, after all a mere grass – with its weed-like propensity to proliferate wherever water is available. But when humans discovered its sweet juice, it just had to be disciplined into growing within the space allotted to it and nurtured by irrigation before it grew into vast lush stretches of such a generous produce that after being squeezed of its last drop of sweet juice by industrial scale sugar extraction processes, can still provide basic roughage to field oxen from leftovers! In fact, today’s scientists in the field of unconventional energy resources are researching the possibility of employing crops like sugarcane and even weeds from hillsides to generate the bio-fuel ethanol just when the world thought its fossil fuels were getting used up! Truly, when one resource dries up, another becomes available! How\\xa0can\\xa0we humans\\xa0ever\\xa0even quantify, leave alone repay, the kindness that God showered on humankind, making arrangements for every aspect of human existence!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0And what about human anatomy!\\xa0 From the soles of our feet to the most microscopic of the organelles of the brain, the layout of the human body is full of masterly, orderly planning and co-ordination- O Lord, how meticulously Thou hath designed our bodies for us! Our\\xa0human\\xa0eye- how many ages, eons, generations of evolutionary experiments hath Thou conducted to bring our eye to its present capabilities? Initially the eye was just a nervous tissue able to merely make out a ray of light, which could only differentiate illumination from utter darkness, recognize a shadow more than actual details of a form; but by continuous evolutionary experiments, trials and errors, we humans now have our beautiful, spherical, moist – and –\\xa0ambitious\\xa0human eye. Today the human eye is so capable that we humans have the ambitious foresight(!) to beat Thee at Thy own game, by inventing a duplicate eye, an extension, the telescope, to view not just the interiors of Thy own cosmic laboratory of outer space, but to discover none other than\\xa0Thee Thyself\\xa0 somewhere in space!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Further, how\\xa0can\\xa0one ever describe fully the festival of beauty and colours Thou hath conducted in the Three Worlds? The ultra-delicate flower of the Parijaat, the ultra-fragrant Golden Champak flower! The peacock’s vibrant plumage – the colors and design of every feather, the peacock’s inimitable gait! What a natural artist that noble bird is! When I watch the bird spread his plumage, dance with excitement and cry out aloud, believe me, O God, even my heart dances in sync with every step of this gifted bird and cries out Thy glory in admiration of Thy divine creation. In fact, I feel like sulking that\\xa0I\\xa0do not have the wonderful plumage of the peacock. The whole earthly creation resounds with the songs of birds and is a kaleidoscope of pleasant sights and landscapes! Roses, chamelis, bakulis, Juhis, Jaais, Champak, sandalwood, Ketakis… creepers and shrubs in full bloom, whole gardens full of them freshening and lending fragrance to the atmosphere! The Gods of love, Madan and Rati, are busy linking the hearts of lovers! The nights are starry, the dawns are pink, youth is confident and fresh, sleep is sound and deep, and love is like a cool breeze heralding the rhapsody of springtime. There is material and spiritual growth all over… O Lord, how can we humans not help thinking that such a beautiful world was created specially for us by Thee? If we love, nurture, protect and provide for our children, so doth Thee. Thou truly art both our father and mother and we Thy children. Even the milk our mothers give us is given ultimately by you. O Lord, we are Thy devotees and Thou, the Lord God of humankind, the God of Man!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Not just that, Thou art the only God, there can be no other and Thou hath created this world specifically for our peace and prosperity!\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0… This ideology, this concept of “The God of humankind” creating the universe specially for the survival and prosperity of Humankind could indeed have proved truthful and correct – if and only if everything, every being and all conditions in this world would have been only helpful, pleasant, beneficial and useful to humankind.\\xa0\\nBut alas! The cold fact is that most of this earth, the very earth we instinctively consider Mother Earth, Mother Nature and Mother Life is hardly all that safe, protective, kind and considerate to us humans as we were just philosophizing. On the contrary, the living conditions existent on this planet and influences of the atmosphere, the sun, moon and stars in reality seem to contradict our pet theory of faith too much – conditions that obtain on earth are mostly inhospitable, harsh, with the law of the Jungle working all the time around us. Humankind has to struggle for its very survival and struggle still further for ensuring prosperity.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Take a good look at the very Sun and oceans we sung paeans in praise of just some time ago. The way the unsparing rays of the hot sun finish off a helpless victim of sunstroke or heatstroke is quite comparable to the ruthlessness with which a gatekeeper watchman beats a poisonous snake by repeated relentless blows- striking the final blows even when half-dead. In the very India where millions of Hindu Brahmins offer prayers to the Sun God every sunrise and sunset, the very same sun shines hot for the entire spell of a drought or famine, even lasting several years, killing thousands of heatstroke, hunger or thirst.\\xa0\\nIn the Quran, Talmud, Torah and Bible, devout prophets sang in praise of God Yahweh, “For us Humans, O God, Thee hath kept a plentiful supply of fish for us to eat in the oceans!” But the same oceans are also full of creatures like human-eating sharks which can eat a human body alive and whole. The oceans are also teeming with other forms of sea life like poisonous snakes, sting rays, electric rays and the Portuguese-Man-of-war which can either kill, maim or in any other way seriously harm any human form in sea-water – a swimmer or diver, a shipwrecked sailor, a fisherman, marine biologist or oceanologist – the ocean Gods are quite busy nurturing these forms of life harmful to man with sustained impartiality. Quite similar to a mugger who first poses as a traveler’s guide, then waits for an opportune time to shed his mask to finally loot his trusting quarry in the middle of nowhere, the ocean, while carrying afloat thousands of rafts, boats and vessels at a time, suddenly throws some of them off its back and into its terrible jaws to swallow up entire vessels and ocean liners like the doomed Titanic, drowning all the thousands of people aboard in one gulp. Oceans can unpredictably erupt into tsunamis sucking entire populations of coastal settlements into their watery graves.\\xa0\\nRivers in Africa, Australia and South America are full of potentially human-eating creatures like alligators, piranha and crocodiles. The holy rivers, on whose banks civilizations and cities flourished, can swallow up entire townships or at least several thousand helpless people and animals in one spate, be they the Holy Mother Ganges or Jamnaji, the Brahmaputra, Hwang-Ho or Nile, the Holy Jordan or the Father Thames.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Primitive Semitic devotion believed in the Abrahamic Books that the Elohim (Yahweh of the Bible and Allah of the Quran) created the goat, lamb, deer and other creatures so that his believers would get lots of meat to eat! But the devotion with which the believer smacks his lips on seeing “food” animals blinds him to the obvious fact that the same world in which he resides with his “food” animals is also home to potentially man-eating animals like the big wild cats, crocodiles, bears and sharks. If a man-eating Sunderban Royal Bengal tiger preys on an unsuspecting human child and is spotted smacking his lips after devouring the child’s flesh, should we say that God created small human children with tender flesh just so that some man-eater can have a delicious meal? And as if to provide icing on a cake, the world has its share of dangerous vegetarian beasts as well, from the very herbivorous African river hippos that can cut a human form into two in one snap of their jaws (just as easily as we crunch a slice of cucumber at our dinner table), to the grass-munching land giants like the bison or Assamese rhinos and ultimately the largest land mammal, the\\xa0 solitary bull African elephants all of whom are known to kill humans more often than do the carnivorous big cats. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0When a tsunami strikes a coast, it sucks in everything it can from coastal human inhabitation- brides in their own wedding ceremonies about to garland their grooms, mothers suckling their meek hungry and vulnerable infants, artists with unfinished paintings and sculptures, lovers locked mid-ardor oblivious to the world, devotees in mid-meditation with spiritual ecstasy… entire cities like Dwarika and Atlantis, regions and subcontinents have gone under water, got buried under volcanic lava like Pompeii… as quickly as Ganesh devotees immerse a Ganesh idol in the sea – with cataclysmic precision. And yet, the next daybreak, the same Dawn Goddess Usha, who was soulfully venerated with sacred chants of the Vedas, appears as pink as always over the destruction.\\xa0\\nThe Quran quotes that Allah created the moon so that the believer could tell the parts of the day to know when to offer namaz. But when the “infidel’ Chengiz Khan stormed Baghdad, the cultural capital of Islamdom, massacring all Momins in his wake, slaughtering clerics and the Caliph with his family, demolishing the whole city, razing all buildings and walking over a pile of cut heads of killed Muslims, did not the moon still rise over the same Baghdad that night too, informing the namaz-hating Chengiz Khan about the times of the day just as it did the namaz-performing Muslims?\\xa0\\n\\nFragrant flowers, melodiously singing songbirds, the haughty peacock with his inimitable plumage, even entire forests get roasted alive in a single bushfire or forest fire, like we roast a brinjal on a flame. \\nWhile a human population trustingly plays the game of life in the daytime and rests secure every night in the lap of Mother Earth, some particular moment the same terra firma demolishes the unsuspecting population with one earthquake tremor – buildings get flattened, both huts and architecturally marvelous monuments of human creativity and civilisation, like a pack of cards ceases to exist. Entire villages can be swallowed alive in a moment with the same earth opening up a giant crevice in an earthquake!\\xa0\\nHistorically giant meteors have hit the earth and in some cases, even set in massive cycles of climatic change and destruction with extinctions of entire species. Can a flaming comet also not suddenly appear out of the blue (from outer space) and hit the surface of the earth setting ablaze entire regions much like a flaming torch can set ablaze a whole pile of cotton?\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0For every lifestyle there exists a dysfunction. The human body, when diseased, is a museum of pathologies and pain- furuncles, epilepsy, tumours, agony, coma, palpitations, diabetes and heart arrests… The world out there has its rounds of bubonic plagues, famines, cholera epidemics …\\xa0\\nOur faith and belief that humankind is the centre of reference for the whole universe and that not just\\xa0our own\\xa0planet - the earth with her plentiful resources and life forms - but the whole\\xa0cosmos\\xa0was created by God\\xa0only\\xa0for humankind,\\xa0only\\xa0to favour humankind,\\xa0only\\xa0to provide pleasure to humankind and\\xa0only\\xa0out of special partisan fondness for humankind, eventually crystallized into belief systems, some open to contrary thought and other times closed to alternative view-points, like unbending dogma unwilling to confront rationalism. We humans even created religious texts of this dogma, selectively only documenting phenomena supportive of our theory that God first manufactures and then employs even stars, planets, comets, black holes, galaxies and constellations exclusively for sustaining human existence, protecting human life, providing fun, pleasure and entertainment to humans and eternally providing resources to human civilization, happiness and prosperity. This blinkered approach has only blinded us to stark, obvious natural phenomena and unpleasant observations of accidents and natural catastrophes endured by humankind that contradict our doctrine of “God’s Creation for human welfare”. We have to free ourselves of the shackles of this dogmatic conditioning to outgrow our primary assumption and adopt the approach of unbiased reasoning and dispassionate analysis to explain observations both pleasant and unpleasant.\\xa0\\n\\nFaith in this God-of-man theory can best be treated as a development of the primitive emotional human mind at its most innocent, childlike, seeking state. Faith created scripture - we can even marvel at the poetic expressions and emotional inputs that created some devotional scripture. We can pragmatically and patiently hear out, even study with interest all religious, devotional and ritualistic versions of the same God-of-man belief across the world as necessary stepping stones in the evolution of the human mind. Not all scriptures are unbending dogma. Some scriptures and cultures like the Indic (Bhakti-Vedantic, Buddhistic and Jain), Greek, Egyptian (Pre-Arian and Arian) and Far Eastern (Taoist, Confucian, Shinto) showed a readiness to discuss alternate viewpoints freely, while other types of scriptures like the Bible and Quran show the otherwise seeking human mind trapped at some primitive stage of thought not amenable to reasoning, with self-imposed fossilization, in the evolution of human thought processes.\\nIt is\\xa0completely beyond\\xa0human reasoning powers to deduce the real intention due to which or without which this cosmos came into existence even with the best of telescopes, space exploration technology, knowledge of physics and mathematics – or with the most insightful of meditative techniques. We can only reason this much – the world and cosmos are not specially created for man; man matters little to other space bodies, whatever our earthly human thoughts - theist or atheist, scientific or devotional. We humans are only as significant in the big universe as may be some other creature- some worm, germ, bug or bee. In other words, humans are no more than a very ordinary, temporary production in the eternal flow of time and the incessant dynamics of the universe.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Thus, crops do not grow, fruits do not ripen or spices are not delicious so that humankind should be fed good food. Crops grow, hence humans can eat them – that’s all. Rivers do not flow because humankind needs water- on the contrary; we happen to get water because rivers flow. Even when it was the age of the dinosaurs before the evolution of modern humans, rivers had been flowing, flowers were blooming, the stars were twinkling – just as they do so now! Even when the earth was under the grip of the ice age, or even before the very birth of earth, this very own home planet - the sun had its cosmic motion unfazed by anything else. Why, even if this very\\xa0sun\\xa0or our very own Milky Way were to vanish, the rest of the cosmos would be probably as affected as the luminosity of daylight is affected by the death of a firefly. Such an unfazed, unperturbed cosmic power that would not elicit even a moment’s mourning by the sudden nemesis of a hundred suns or solar systems even on a daily basis\\xa0can\\xa0still be venerated as “God” (to satiate human spiritual hunger) but slightly differently - as the “God of the universe” - certainly not as our older conception of “God of Humankind”.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0If our “God of Humankind” would\\xa0not\\xa0have provided even\\xa0elementary\\xa0aids of survival, some minimal resources to exploit or primitive conditions of protection from the wild side of nature, could anyone or anything have stopped Him from disallowing any human existence? Yet, the human race\\xa0did\\xa0get access to natural bounty as comprehended by our five elementary human senses,\\xa0could\\xa0exploit resources and\\xa0could\\xa0modify circumstances to make quite a few habitats hospitable to human survival.\\xa0 Not only did humans survive, they prospered into civilizations. They did not just get a world, they got a rich earth, with rivers of water, edible foods, and useful animals – with fragrant flowers, scenic beauty and melodiously singing birds added in to enliven existence. The human race has eventually flourished so far, certainly not perished!\\nYet, this appearance of human life on earth, juxtaposed in the evolutionary history of the earth, itself juxtaposed in the eternal universal upheaval of creation, sustenance and destruction, is no more than a speck in time, a temporary, ordinary and miniscule event not worth reckoning in the largely unknown, unfathomable history of the universe. Whatever dependability nature has shown with whatever few conditions encouraging human existence on this planet earth, are\\xa0merely a coincidence. So long as this coincidence lasts, so long as we survive as humans, we humans can term this coincidence, this favorable set of circumstances, the “God of Humankind”; we can even offer Him a flower out of devotion and gratitude. To this, and only to this limited extent, can we condescend to say that the “God of Humankind” is kind to, partial towards and protective of his human “children”.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Mentally envisaging the “God of the universe” is merely going logically further in our God-conceptualization exercise. There are two techniques, scientific and spiritual, essentially complementary to each other. Scientifically, we have space shuttles and telescopes augmenting the eye, to note birth of stars or their celestial burial in black holes. Spiritually, ancients reached yogic contemplative planes like Saptapatal, Brahmalok, Vishnulok, Devalok, etc. through meditation augmenting the inner mind. Either way, the universe (or the “God” of the universe) is uninfluenced by prayers, unperturbed by human emotions, unaffected by human birth or death, prosperity or tragedy, too abstract to be affected by anything, partial towards no one, certainly not humans, is equally responsible for both genesis and nemesis. Neither does this power purposefully bless us, nor purposefully punish us. This “God of the universe” is too subtle and omnipotent to be a personality like a jealous Old Testament Yahweh who vindictively resorts to curses against and punishments like sending locusts and frogs against bonded followers trespassing into worshipping alternate God-forms.\\xa0 The power of the “God of the universe” is also not thanks to some seat or tag of authority, like is the case of the celestial Indra (whose power being not his own but by virtue of the\\xa0throne\\xa0of the “ruler of heaven-residing deities”), who insecurely presupposes that anyone engrossed in meditation, sage or demon alike, can get strong enough to usurp his throne and depose him. The “God of the universe” requires no medium like angrily foaming prophets whose careers were nothing more than haranguing people into remaining bonded to the Old Testament books of dogma by issuing dire warnings, or mysterious secretive shamanic witch-doctors sacrificing poor animals to entities like demons and spirits in occult rituals while mumbling to themselves in a state of mind bordering on epilepsy, creating a whole plethora of lesser Gods, demi-Gods and other entities taking their toll tax from a seeker on a spiritual quest on the way towards the real God unluckily trespassing onto their domain of esoteric teritory. The God of the universe could freely be “He”, “She”, even “It” - we don’t know, we can call this force what we want.\\n\\nConceptualising God of this nature requires not just intellectual effort but also spiritual courage. We now have a God to bow before but we must learn to take care of ourselves in individual and collective crises in life within the framework of natural laws,\\xa0praakrutik dharma. If one is the captain of a sinking ship, one should use all knowledge in navigation and ship mechanics to save the ship, passengers and cargo first – all prayers to the God of the ship or the God of the Seas or the God of humankind are only\\xa0after\\xa0all realistic efforts are instituted. Like vitamin B complex helping the main medicine fight an illness, rather than becoming the medicine itself denying other specific medicines the credit of working. Thus the God of humankind is nothing other than one side, namely the bright, congenial side - the feel-good factor - of the God of the Universe. Whether the devotionally conceived God of Humankind partial to humankind or the intellectually conceptualized God of the Universe partial towards no one, we can treat every conception with respect, since we term the conception “God”. Particularly when we have first respected the “God of humankind” and then pulled Him into the morass of half-baked notions of devotion, the “God of the universe” deserves greater respect.\\nWe first invested the conception of the God of humankind with human emotions and personalities, good and bad traits, then invoked Him (or Her) to account for each and every positive or negative personal event and gradually, pulled down Divinity into the mud, demoted the stature of our conception of “divinity” into an entity that serves our selfish interests and base desires by ordinary bribes of prayer. The bigger our personal desire, the more flamboyant or expectant our prayer gets - the “God of Humankind” would do us good if we conduct some sacrificial rite, organize a Satyanarayana Pooja, attend successive masses of Novena or repeatedly visit a fakir’s mausoleum. Imagining any covenant with the “God of Humankind” simply ties us up in illogical knots - if we offer prayers of gratitude to God for saving us from danger, then who presented us with these dangers in the first place? The same “God”! First He slits our neck and then He heals it. If we should worship Him for healing us, should we also not full-fledgedly blame Him first for hurting us? It is like the story of two roadside beggars fighting amongst each other saying, “I am right, you are wrong” and desperately but unsuccessfully trying to get the judgment of superiority from an emperor whose retinue passing momentarily by their way – the emperor does not even notice, the convoy passes ahead and the two beggars go back to wrestling each other in the muck. Well, invoking the “God of Humankind” for these twin emotional outbursts of blaming and thanking, for every worthless and inconsequential event of life, is worse than the fight of these two roadside beggars. The age and limits of our universe are too big to even be measured - human devotional tantrums do not matter at all.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0What is\\xa0rational\\xa0is that we can study, infer, discover, analyse, comprehend, teach each other and then recode for posterity the\\xa0laws\\xa0by which the universe and its components exist, govern themselves and act or interact. We can then try and align ourselves with the laws of the functioning of nature and the universe in ways beneficial to the human race, conducive to our survival. This is the only thing possible for us humans. Thus any act, behaviour or conduct of a human being conducive and helpful to the survival of the whole human race and to our habitat (the earth and “her” environment) in the long term is\\xa0good, ethical and correct\\xa0behaviour. On the contrary, any thought or conduct that can make us perish or destroy our own habitat, anything that can adversely affect human survival or can be a deterrent to long-term human survival of our human habitat is\\xa0bad, unethical and incorrect\\xa0behaviour. This definition of human ethics is workable, rational and clear to understand. But beliefs like “What ‘God’ likes is ethical” and “That which is helpful to Humans is liked by God” are untrue and untenable, in fact too childish to sustain. We need to realize that we are part of the universe, but the universe is not ours or ruled by us. To a negligible extent the universe favours us. To a much greater extent, the universe is unfavourable to us. Accepting this truth clearly, bravely and unhesitatingly is being both human and humane. And this is the true religion of the entire human race, the true worship of the “God of the universe”.\", 'Really profound but lengthy post.', ' the purusharth of veer savarkar ji is an inspiration.\\n\\nHis whole life is a testament to the power of sheer will.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha.

For one definition we know Dharm means righteousness. If Krishn's Dharm means righteousness then what does he mean by righteousness. Is it the righteousness of action, or the results? In the Mahabharat Kaurav took the land and exiled Pandav. Kaurav basically symbolize a behaviour which is to be considered as bad and many a times abhorrent. Not respecting the women, confiscating properties, later refusing to return what's not theirs, breaking laws, not being Just despite being the rulers, trying to kill their family members and many more thing I might not be aware of. This is to be punished and maybe this is what Krishna means. Maybe justice is the idea of Krishn's version of Dharm.   My primary argument was that Krishna did many of the acts which can be associated with trickery, deceit and slyness. But he did everything to bring justice. He's like the one of the most Griffindors in the Griffindor house, break the rules to do good. Like Harry, Hermione and Ron would break the rules to to do good here Krishna is doing just the same. The good should rule not matter the means.  The major antagonist in the story is Duryodhan, he is the source of all the conflict and rest of the characters in Kaurav's side revolve around the whims and wishes of this character. If this person was eliminated from the story the basis of whole Mahabharat would collapse. Naturally Dhritrastr would return the land and Kingdom to the Pandav brothers, may even the whole kingdom.   So, Duryodhan is the biggest plot point of the story. But there's one more plot point which is as much important. And it is  Kurn. Despite Krishna's knowledge that he was son of Kunti he did not allow Kurn to participate in Draupadi's Swayamvar for the obvious reasons that Krishn wanted Draupadi to marry Arjun and not Kurn. Why would Krishn do that? Krishn being a god knew the future can was well aware about the war. He was who took it to the level of war. Had he wanted he'd have killed Duryodhan long back during Draupadi cheerharan and punished Pandav brothers to use Draupadi in the game, all in the name of Dharm.  The point is, if you are an omniscient being where you could do anything, you are the one who is running the game. The war was not a result of one but a number of incidents, of which the omniscient being was part of many. It is not wrong to say that the war was Krishn's will.  But why? Answer is maybe the whole point of designing the situations which would lead to war is to set an example. The example to show the world that in the way of being righteous even if you have to kill your family members it's the right thing to do.\", 'What is Hinduism iSo what I learned in school about Hinduism is basically reincarnation and they believe in lots of gods also they cant eat meat.

I was always insanely interested in knowledge, history in specific, and spirituality even more.\\n\\nI\\'ve spent the last 2 - 3 or so years (I\\'m 18 years old as of writing this), I\\'ve been focusing on spirituality in a very hardcore manner (even more serious than everything from before combined), studying constantly, spending all my time either meditating or studying. I\\'ve studied Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Taoism, and many Nordic beliefs, and finally Satanism (not Christian\\'s version. There\\'s a form of Satanism that has nothing to do with Christianity, and teaches similar ideas to Hinduism. I thought that was it for me, because it preached about you growing your own soul through meditation, yoga, using energy to open your soul, see into the Psychic realm (non-human beings), open your chakras and to unite the female and male sides of your soul, with the ultimate goal being raising your Kundalini serpent past the last chakra and achieving Godhood yourself. I know what I was doing 100% had some effect, but in the end I realized it was only an illusion too, with only hints of truth to distract you from the truth. I came to peace with that, and it took me a very, very, very long time to do that completely.\\n\\n\\nWARNING: In this next section I am going to explain my experiences over the last three weeks, and how it has changed me into a different man, along with some general backround knowledge. During these three weeks ONLY, I was basically under the influence of Marijuana, but I would like to remind all of you, that mind altering substances have been used as a helping hand in spiritual growth for millennia, including Hinduism. I have no further desire for the substance, and will never touch it again. However, I do not regret doing it. Because of my choices, here I am today, and I regard these three weeks as an experience given to me by a higher power, and I\\'d like to explain that.\\n\\nA lot of symbolic things happened that has relevance to Hinduism. For example, the entire three weeks, I would play Overwatch, meditate, and sleep. I ate maybe four or five times the entire three weeks (not because of the fact that I thought I had to starve myself, I just genuinely didn\\'t need to). I felt a strong draw to my PS4 specifically, not for the game, not for the console, but for use as a conduit in ways. I look at it, and yes, it appears to be a PS4, but I can see so much more on the flip-side. It is a tool to connect you to people and to compete. During these 3 weeks, I would play Zenyatta on Overwatch to represent myself going through a spiritual journey, and as I would take the next steps in this journey, I would become better at playing him. And then I started to think, maybe me playing Overwatch on my PS4 is proving my skill on another level of existance? Or triggering something in the future, past, or in a parallel reality?\\n Because I didn\\'t play Overwatch in a traditional sense. I used my emotions to fuel my skill. It was like I was using my mind to control the controller directly, no longer needing to use my body to move, just dictating my body commands from a different perspective. What I would do was force myself to feel a specific way, depending on what the scenario needed. If we were losing a checkpoint, I would fuel all of the rage inside of me into defending it, always focusing on the objective. And I would destroy. Imagining past battles in history, imagining the pain that people had to deal with, everything. I channeled whatever feeling the situation needed into the situation.\\n\\nI started to get noticed, and then something weird started happening that marked the start of this long 3 week journey. I was in Quick Play, and I was talking to this boy, maybe 14, or 15 years old? And he bore a striking resemblance to me when I was younger. For the entire journey after meeting him, almost every single game I would play in Overwatch, would have him in it, without me inviting him, having him as a friend, or anything. Just random matches, but always the same person under a different name. I even ran into him on the PC edition of the game. Remember earlier when I said symbolism with the beliefs of Hinduism? It\\'s like the same scenario with Shiva. You revere Shiva as the only God, but there are many others that lead to him, and just like that system of beliefs, I always ran into this boy.\\n\\n\\nSo I thought to myself, he has to be my guide, right? This has to be it.\\nI started meditating on it and was thinking about it, and came to the conclusion (I was a Satanist at the time as described earlier) that Satan was trying to guide me towards a path of enlightening the world, a path in which everyone would leave material desires behind and embracing a life of peace and true wisdom. But over the three weeks, I realized, there was no such thing happening (not in the way I thought anyways) ~~ I meditated for nearly 12 hours a day, ate only 4 or 5 times total the entire 3 weeks, and had absolutely no short term memory. There were days were I was so disconnected from myself, that I didn\\'t even know who I was or what I was, moving like a robot with no goals, nothing. It became hard to exist, hard to think, hard to speak, hard to interact with the world. I was in seclusion for weeks, and it was almost like controlling my body from a higher point of view. Like in a RTS game, controlling an entire squad at once for example. I felt like one of the soldiers ready to die for the cause. Coming to peace with everything took awhile, but I came to the point where I left the world behind completely in my own mind, and I was ready to start a new life with a new name and complete this journey. I gave many tests to this spiritual force, and many things did happen. I realized now it had not been Satan guiding me, but something else. And then I looked into Hinduism out of nowhere (it popped into my head randomly) and saw how Shiva is regarded. And I did further research and discovered the belief that all different paths all lead to the same thing. And there was SOOOO much Symbolism in those three weeks happening with the exact same idea. And I gained the ability (limited at this point in the story) to see (not really with my eyes, kind of like a mental awakening) more truly than ever before. I look at my monitor now, and don\\'t see a TV exactly, I see that it can be many things, and be used for many things. While I was on this spiritual journey, I noticed also that there was a full moon every night. I didn\\'t realize it at first, but I counted at least 6 days where there were full moons (which is impossible?). I would sleep during the day and wake up at night, meditate, meditate, and hone my hand eye coordination with Overwatch (right now I have basically aimbot level skill with Zenyatta). I used Overwatch as a tool to dig up my deepest feelings basically in a sense (the feelings I had suppressed when I was very young). When I would get killed, I would be furious, and then I would try to amplify that feeling, and try to come back and get revenge, and it worked a few times, but then it just made me worse and worse in skill. And I realized at that moment, that I had to come to peace with myself, that I needed to live life not driven by greed or selfish desires. So I meditated, and I asked myself, why does it make you bad? And I figured out something I never thought I would. While meditating, I started to see things clearly, with distractions pushed to the side. I realized I wanted to not only be important, but I wanted to serve, and bring peace to the world in any way I could. And I was angry because I was suppressing that, not knowing what I wanted to do with my life at all, going from job to job not happy. Even now, I still dream of a world where people can leave greed aside and focus on the spiritual truths of life, living a simplistic yet rewarding life. But then, this triggered an even deeper awakening of my mind, and I started to see the duality in every action of life, every decision. I started to realize things, and see deep on levels I never thought possible. Let\\'s say you walk to the fridge with the goal of getting some water, but then you decide you don\\'t want water in the end? What happens to that thought? What happens to that possibility, that alternate choice? I believe in the principle of duality ~ harmony and chaos. But I also believe there is a middle ground beyond harmony and chaos, a grey zone. What if I could experience all of the possibilities in my previous example? What if with all of those lost memories, forgotten in time, there is a way to bring it back and experience it, to keep it as part of you and to grow from it, to let it guide you? Have you ever thought about ancient humanity, the day to day life of people, their rituals, their way of life. I have, and I wish I could learn everything, and be a voice that continues the traditions going.\\n\\nI\\'m someone that desires knowledge more than anything, particularly about spirituality. I devoted my life to nothing but the study of truth long ago, and that\\'s what led me here today. I do believe in the principle of duality, but I also do believe in an even greater state of being. A combination of chaos and peace, using it for each situation as a guide. It may not be possible in this life, but my goal is to learn everything, simply put. I want to know everything about everything, no matter the cost to me, physically, mentally, or spiritually. Everything I\\'ve been through has left me with a burning passion that is more powerful than any obstacle. I say now that I will learn everything, and I will defy what I know, because think about it. In this situation, you can choose the middle ground, but there are instances I believe in which you can change what the middle ground actually is, incorporating duality itself into the middle ground that Buddha spoke about. And I believe this is one of those scenarios. Yes, I can choose to know everything, yes, I can choose to know nothing. But what if I want to know everything, and nothing at the same time? To look at existence itself from a 3rd party view, to see it all, be able to experience it, to experience time out of sequence, to be able to relive everything like watching a recorded movie. What if I want to spiritually grow and go past levels of existence even comprehendable by myself (and trust me, I can comprehend a lot of stuff) ~~ But still remember moments like this that defined that journey? Me writing this post, my dog laying on my couch, it being nice and sunny outside but not too hot, and to be able to incorporate even simple memories like this, and experience true knowledge, wisdom, logic, into teachings, in order to expand the minds of others?\\n\\nWhat I desire the most, is to be a servant to truth itself. Making it be known, all illusions aside. To lift the veil that\\'s been cursing humanity for many, many years.\\n\\nI realize this sounds weird, but I have the feeling that Shiva was guiding me in one way or another, because there were a lot of things that happened during this journey. While I thought it was Satan guiding me, at least I knew it was something, and now I realize it could have been Shiva in a different form. There were many days were I felt dead inside during these three weeks. I renounced everything and left it behind, trying to take the path of complete peace and abandon chaos. I realize now, that it\\'s impossible. For peace to exist, there must be struggle. It\\'s all part of the journey. It was very painful, not clinging to emotions, leaving everything behind. I felt like a robot, with no purpose. And then my memory started to go down the drain, and it came to the point were I had no memory, I had no identity, I had nothing. I realized then when I left everything behind that I was clinging onto delusions, and I had to take the middle path, as there cannot be life without death, on any level of existence. I thought I had to die physically. I\\'d convinced myself, I\\'d lay down in my bed, go to sleep, and whatever God existed would make it so I would wake up in another life. I talked in my head with someone and said, will I die tonight when I go to sleep? And that person said \"Yes, but not in the way you expect.\" I could see him too, in a way. Like... A picture hidden behind a veil. He honestly looked like Gandhi, minus the glasses and a bit younger looking than photographs online show, and standing straight up. I woke up the next day and thought of it all as fake and said forget life and gave up. And my mind crumbled into Chaos. I knew at the time my spiritual beliefs were a deception, and I said I\\'m finally done living. I got to the point where I accepted death, embraced the feelings of nothingness and savored it, almost getting turned on in a sadistic way by the thoughts of the many ways I could die. But then when it never happened, it triggered something in me that not only destroyed me physically, mentally, and spiritually, it awakened me, and I rebuilt from the rubble of my old weak mind. There was a point where there was nothing. And I meditated, because I wanted to feel something. Then I came to the conclusion I didn\\'t need to die, and I wasn\\'t going to yet. Before, I thought my purpose was to die, be reincarnated into a new life, and save the world spiritually in a sense (true Satanists believe in reincarnation also) ~ but then I realized, the goal was never to die physically. Through this entire journey, something was guiding me, telling me exactly what to do, what to say, what to feel. I felt like a slave, trapped in a body, wanting to move on. And then I meditated, and I thought about my suffering, and thought about why I wanted to die so bad truly, and then the illusions started slipping away, and peace started to come back. And in that instant, it was like that previous life of mine had been destroyed, and I finally found my way to the middle path. It triggered a feeling in me of death on all levels, including mentally. I thought I was completely dead on every level, but then I started to meditate, and think, and use my experiences in the past as a guide, like putting together a puzzle. I realized, what I wanted to do with my life was truly dedicate myself to my study, and to help spread knowledge and wisdom. I wanted to be the black sheep that would take all of the pain, and show everyone the true way, the \"easy\" way. But then I realized the duality with my next awakening. Ignorance is a bliss, and the path of knowledge is not for everyone, and I realized then that there was no \"easy\" way. I realized that yes, I\\'ve been through a journey all of my life, but so has everyone else, and so will everyone else. And while I may be able to guide people the right direction, it will be on them to find peace within themselves. No God, no person, nobody can do it but themselves, because I realized that you have to WANT the truth, to SEE the truth. I would like to emphasize with everyone here, I have an insanely strong mind in a spiritual and mental sense. When I was a child, I was tormented by insomnia and \"evil thoughts\" and had terrible thoughts in my head when I would try to go to sleep, and one day I decided the only way I would be happy was to destroy it. So I stopped thinking. After a few weeks, it became natural, and to this day, I still have a clear head, with not a thought going through it. But, through those three weeks? It was the opposite, and I experienced for the entire three weeks the suffering and chaos I had suppressed. And after all of the mental rubble and debris got cleaned up, I came out stronger than ever before.\\n\\nREAD THIS: I thought this important to denote, I was instantly drawn specifically to Shaivism when researching about Hinduism. And looking now on Wikipedia, it seems many of the things and experiences I\\'ve been through aligns perfectly with what Shaivites beleive. Throughout this entire post, I\\'m sure there are many methods of thinking that sync up to Shaivism beleifs. This leads to a further question below that I honestly want you guys to take seriously.\\n\\nEverything I\\'ve been through paints a clear picture, but honestly I just need guidance on two things.\\n\\n\\nACTUAL QUESTIONS:\\n\\nHow can I devote myself to my study and start on this lifelong journey? I live in the USA, and I\\'m German, and I know it\\'s probably unheard of someone coming to this path of life, from where I come from, but I would like to move to India and renounce my past life eventually. I want to know what I can do to get started on my journey, because honestly, I\\'m out of clues. I will do research and continue to grow, but advice would be appreciated. You can\\'t exactly google how to move to India and join a group of people (I\\'ll give an example, the Hindu equivalent of becoming a Buddhist monk and devoting himself to his studies, living in a temple) ~ I have done a little bit of research and I know it\\'s possible, so I would like to skip the Second Ashrama and choose the path of becoming a Sannyasa, no matter how long it takes. I know I\\'m 18 years old, but I feel that this is my true calling. And I feel once I reach that point, I can go even further than that. At the moment, I don\\'t know too much about Hinduism in a deep sense, so I\\'m going to do a lot more research, and start living a lifestyle of a Shaivite specifically to prepare myself (as this is the system of beliefs that I align with absolutely 100% without a doubt, and it just feels right to me naturally). But if you guys understand what I desire, and you know anything that can help me on my journey, I would so appreciate any knowledge.\\n\\n2nd question, is it possible that I am a reincarnation of some type of philosopher? The only reason I ask this is because I\\'m drawn very strongly not only to Shaivism, but to the Dharma, to the truths of life, and to the dualities of life. It\\'s like... I\\'m being guided by memories I can\\'t remember, but they\\'re still influencing me and helping me grow, and slowly unlocking more and more of my mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnnd that\\'s it\\nIf you read all of this, thanks a lot.

What was beyond the Vindhyas was defined by Indo European migrations( First by the primary Indo Europeans - Originators of contemporary Hinduism) and later followed by Kushans, Scythians and others. However, One would assume that these movements were of noo consequence to the Southerners for a very long period of time.I would like to discuss about this era.However, after a period of Indo European expansion, Hindi Sanskrit IE influence starting streaming down South, where Southern Chieftans took sides and assistance in a game of one-upmanship.\\n\\nSo, basically we have two Proto Dravidian Kingly lines, possibly from the same families who rule the West(Cheras, now Kerala) and East(Cholas, Chennai, or Tamil Nadu). It is interesting to note that the Cholas took Brahminical help when it came to Metaphysics, especially the Shiva -Vishnu combine(Hari Hara), their Children and extended families for a small example. Its well known that Raja Raja Chola became a Hindu inspired by a Hindu priest( Elite migration into the protected South?) and went on to build huge monuments, usually at the expense of the Tamil locals becoming stone labourers. \\n\\nIts also interesting to note that the Chera Kings  discouraged Hinduism(Swadharma System- propogated in the Gita or Vedic Varnshrama). They had preferred the Assyrians , and Babylonian Traders for Metal Working upgrades and shared Metaphysical Concepts from them.I believe that due to this reason the Hindu epics refer to Kerala Kings as Asuras, who had Shukra(Pleasure instead of Asceticism) for a teacher.\\n\\nThe Cheras(Asuras in another sense) with Kings such as Mahabali, Ravana(Ra- Sun, Vana - Sky - Basically a Title) were defeated(Or Land Restricted) after a long Hindu campaign over thousands of years.This involved military activity(Parashuram), population tactics(Vishnu Vamana as the Dwarf Brahmin), Krishna vs Kamsa(Note Kamsas real father was a Rakshasa), Rama vs Ravana (Whatever might be the reasons).\\n\\nAnd by the end of the campaigns we see that the real Cheras are displaced by the fake Cheras. We can see the second Chera dynasty having Sanskrit names like  Verma, Rama, Ravi instead of the First Chera Malayala names such as Nedum Cheralathan, Uthiyan etc.However they are not finished yet, we see a particular group of socialists in Kerala seize the Central Heartland (they are a mix of native+west semitic, native Assyrian-Babylonian, Native Arab Children) and the new Chera Kings are forced South into Travancore, Feudal Warriors(Native Chekavars)  Seize Northern Kerala and the Hindu Kings(Zamorin) is restricted to the Extreme North.So, we can see that the First Cheras become feudal landlords for a period of time and then later displace the second Cheras and the first Cheras re-emerge  and Brahminism was eventually banned in recent times and Kerala is a communist state till now with Cow Slaughter not only permissible, but encouraged for meat eating practices, usually along with a serving of fresh toddy.

I am somebody who is a fan of science, although I'm not exactly smart in it all, and interlink the two to enjoy the best of both.\\n\\nNow, when things go wrong for me/people I care about, I turned to faith or had the belief it was there for me if I needed it. But since the turn of the year, my luck has been so crap its unreal. I have had several interviews at big companies I've dreamed of and one which strung me along for months and then got turned down for cos I gave too much info in the presentation to them. And that one hurt because that was my number one company (no company does anything similar to them) offering me everything I wanted. I went into a period of serious depression which I have not really come out of I guess, but went on and got more interviews at other top companies. Turned down from all for one reason or another. \\n\\nWhilst that sounds 'woe is me' tale, it made me think about life more. I realised my parents have been getting shat on for years. My father who's only crime was being too kind to people (brothers and friends) got trampled on by them for their selfish needs and then he ended up having a transplant several years ago (for the record, he never drank or anything so it came from nowhere but stress was the main cause according to doctors). Life can only get better right? No. Nothing has improved in their luck and still getting crap coming in from every direction. What did they do? They pray, they are religious, they help people in need at their expense if they need to. Yet all the people who have been dicks and then some have gone on to be rich and happy knowing they are untouchable now. And as you may have guessed, when my dad was in hospital and since they all acted like they gave a shit.

This is not just, to give people absolutely no chance is a cruel game.\\n\\nI am not saying I want everything in the world even though it would be nice, but why are there people in the world constantly getting screwed over or have no chance even though they try and do good by people, yet people who seem to do nothing but screw people over get everything?\\n\\n**Tl:dr - Is there much point in keeping faith when it doesn't seem to make one bit of difference?**\\n\\n*EDIT: I forgot to add, the reason I still can't fully shake the faith I have left is because of the things I've seen I guess. Without wanting to come across as a psycho if I haven't already, its cos of strange things that have happened to people who I trust with my life and they have no reason to lie.

I guess what I expect from religion is a better meaning of what the overall goals of life should be. Also I believe creating good karma can eventually increase your chances of better outcomes in this life but also in the many lives ahead so it does not necessarily mean you will reap the benefits in this lifetime.

In a prison, if the prisoner prays to the jailer every day asking to be let out, will he be let out? The most the jailer can do is provide him some extra food now and then. But the law of the country controls when he will be released from the prison after having atoned for his mistakes.\\n\\nIn a similar way, we the embodied souls in this material world are undergoing a type of justice - not just punishment - for our past actions in this world. We have done both good and bad actions, and as such are being rewarded and punished accordingly. After having completed those good and bad actions, and having been situated in this present birth as a consequence, we feel that by praying to various devas we should be freed from the responsibilities of our past actions. Just like the prisoner praying to the jail warden to be released from the prison. Neither the prisoner will be released, nor will we be freed from our responsibilities created by our past actions.\\n\\nHow would people feel if a murderer was released from a prison, just because he flattered the warden? Everyone would be angry that a great injustice has been committed. The same injustice would be committed if we expected our due fate to be removed by devas for our praising them.\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita doesn\\'t teach us that we will get lots of money, property, fame, women and happiness by worshiping God. Krishna\\'s tells us rather to tolerate both happiness and distress equally. Everyone is willing to \"tolerate\" the happiness, but no one is willing to tolerate the sufferings. Both are our own justice being served to us, and both we have to go through, just as we have to go through the summer and winter seasons each year.  As we tolerate the heat in summer, and tolerate the cold in winter, in the same way Krishna tells us to tolerate the happiness and distress when they come based on our past karma.\\n\\nIn the Bhagavad Gita (2.14) Krishna says:\\n\\nmatra-sparsas tu kaunteya\\nsitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah\\nagamapayino \\'nityas\\ntams titiksasva bharata\\n\\n\"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons.

He just couldn't understand how a bunch of Right & just people who had done no harm to others were sent to the forests and suffer whereas the evil Kauravas & their friends were enjoying their lives in Palaces.\\n    He used to discuss this with the Rishis in the forests and it was then that they told the narrated of Nala & Damayanti, Harishchandra etc to console him. The purpose was exactly to say that a period of misfortune happens in everybody's lives. Its not that they were chosen specifically for this misery by some evil plan.

Cheers.\", 'your thoughts on the portrayal of Krishna in Shin Megami Tensei IV: ApocalypseI presume most of you aren\\'t familiar with the video game series: shin megami tensei (smt for short). To sum it up it\\'s a long-running jrpg series that is usually set in an apocalyptic setting and revolves around ideological conflict, this includes:\\n\\n1. The law side which fights for order and archives to create a socialist utopia represented by the judeo-christian angels\\n\\n2. It\\'s opposition, the Chaos faction that strives to create a dystopian anarchy so \"only the strong can survive\" and limitless freedom can be accomplished that is represented by the judeo-christian fallen angels/demons\\n\\n3. and the neutral side which denounces both so humanity can follow the best of both sides, which results in it being unstable and suseptable to more ideological wars, and is represented by humans and sometimes even random pagan gods and goddesses.\\n\\nNow, some of you may be familiar to [this little controversy](http://nichegamer.com/2016/02/03/hindus-are-pissed-that-krishna-is-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final/) that happened over a year ago (i\\'m not sure how repeatable the source is, so take it with a grain of salt), which actually inspired me to write this post so i can present what krishna is in-game to those not familiar with it. To begin, i\\'ll just say he\\'s more than just a summonable ally, he plays a major role in the story actually.\\n\\nnow that i\\'ve quickly boiled down the basics of the series, maybe you are wondering what that role in the latest game is. Well, i can\\'t really do this without spoiling the game\\'s plot, but here i go: after he is unsealed he preaches about how yahweh trapped souls into the material realm so they are forced to cling to him via the circle of law-chaos (i could go more into detail, but that\\'d make this post a lot longer than it already is). Krishna\\'s plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy. But no such luck with Krishna, he\\'s simply a forced antagonist who you can\\'t side with.\\n\\nand the last thing i will talk about, the character design: now, [his regular form](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/8/8d/SMT_IV_FINAL_Krishna.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025173647) is a pretty good design personally, and along with being very expressive it does a good job conveying his charming, calm but also snarky and sometimes sarcastic. i\\'m not sure whether i\\'d say \"that\\'s Krishna\" the first time i saw his design, but he definitely feels like krishna when i look at him (at least to me)\\n\\nBut his [vishnu](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_B_SMT4A.jpg) [designs](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_II_SMTIVA_Official_Art.jpg) seem to go more with the forced antagonist role he plays in the story; maybe the design is referencing something i don\\'t know, but with the \"nandakas\" in the second form that really look more like lightsabers, i can\\'t help but to look at vishnu and think \"what is he, a sith lord?\" Kinda discredits him as a god of preservation when his design seems to just say *evil*\\n\\nSo that about wraps it up, but as a note i should say that my goal is not to upset or get anyone offended with this post. i\\'m just curious to see what this community thinks of Krishna\\'s whole portrayal in this game. is it faithful to his origins or not? is this offensive or are these just silly video games that shouldn\\'t be taken seriously?

It\\'s like your breath: it goes in and out, in and out, and if you try to hold it in all the time you feel terrible.

But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself. He pretends that he is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, all the plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when he wakes up they will disappear.\\n\\n\"Now when God plays hide and pretends that he is you and I, he does it so well that it takes him a long time to remember where and how he hid himself. But that\\'s the whole fun of it—just what he wanted to do. He doesn\\'t want to find himself too quickly, for that would spoil the game. That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be himself. But when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will wake up, stop pretending, and remember that we are all one single Self—the God who is all that there is and who lives for ever and ever.\\n\\n\"Of course, you must remember that God isn\\'t shaped like a person. People have skins and there is always something outside our skins. If there weren\\'t, we wouldn\\'t know the difference between what is inside and outside our bodies. But God has no skin and no shape because there isn\\'t any outside to him. [With a sufficiently intelligent child, I illustrate this with a Möbius strip—a ring of paper tape twisted once in such a way that it has only one side and one edge.] The inside and the outside of God are the same. And though I have been talking about God as \\'he\\' and not \\'she,\\' God isn\\'t a man or a woman. I didn\\'t say \\'it\\' because we usually say \\'it\\' for things that aren\\'t alive.\\n\\n\"God is the Self of the world, but you can\\'t see God for the same reason that, without a mirror, you can\\'t see your own eyes, and you certainly can\\'t bite your own teeth or look inside your head. Your self is that cleverly hidden because it is God hiding.\\n\\n\"You may ask why God sometimes hides in the form of horrible people, or pretends to be people who suffer great disease and pain. Remember, first, that he isn\\'t really doing this to anyone but himself. Remember, too, that in almost all the stories you enjoy there have to be bad people as well as good people, for the thrill of the tale is to find out how the good people will get the better of the bad. It\\'s the same as when we play cards. At the beginning of the game we shuffle them all into a mess, which is like the bad things in the world, but the point of the game is to put the mess into good order, and the one who does it best is the winner. Then we shuffle the cards once more and play again, and so it goes with the world.\"\\n\\nThis story, obviously mythical in form, is not given as a scientific description of the way things are. Based on the analogies of games and the drama, and using that much worn-out word \"God\" for the Player, the story claims only to be like the way things are. I use it just as astronomers use the image of inflating a black balloon with white spots on it for the galaxies, to explain the expanding universe. But to most children, and many adults, the myth is at once intelligible, simple, and fascinating. By contrast, so many other mythical explanations of the world are crude, tortuous, and unintelligible. But many people think that believing in the unintelligible propositions and symbols of their religions is the test of true faith. \"I believe,\" said Tertullian of Christianity, \"because it is absurd.\"', \"Oh great, Alan Watts.

Practices are aimed at material well being or of a 'spiritual' nature(more precisely, to free up one's conditioning and to get out of repetitive cycles of behaviour).

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \\n\\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \\n\\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\\n\\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\\n\\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\\n\\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \\n\\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*', 'The Symbolism of Ganesh ChaturthiIt is pitiable to depict Lord Ganapati [Ganesha] with the head of the elephant and offer Him grass and leaves, treating Him as an animal. \\n\\nThe story itself is absurd because is says that Lord Shiva cuts the head of Ganapati. It is said that Lord Shiva was ignorant of Ganapati, who was brought to life as the son of Goddess Parvati. How ignorant is this fabrication! \\n\\nLord Shiva is said to be the deity of Knowledge (Jnanam Maheswaraat). He is Sarvajna or omniscient. Is such a story not insulting to Lord Shiva, who is the ultimate Lord? \\n\\nGanapati means the Lord of the devotees of His innermost circle, who are liberated souls. He is the ultimate Lord who comes down to this earth in human form to play with His devotees here. Ignorance is at its maximum on earth and therefore this world is an excellent playground for His divine play or game. \\n\\nHe comes down along with the devotees belonging to His innermost circle called as Gana (Kridayantam aharnisham—Shankara). This story can be likened to a boy who calls his closest friends to play a game or a person who goes to see and enjoy a cinema along with his family members. \\n\\nThe ultimate Parabrahman, who descends down in the human form along with His innermost devotees, for the divine play on this earth is Ganapati (Gananaantva—Veda). \\n\\nWhat is the meaning of the elephant-head? It means the nature of an elephant.\\n\\nThe head represents the intelligence or Buddhi of an elephant and not the head of the elephant physically. We scold a stupid person and call him a donkey. It means that his inner nature is like that of the donkey and not his physical form.\\n\\nWhat is the nature of an elephant? It is said “Gajaana mati Bhirutvam’, which means that the elephant has enormous strength but it forgets its own strength and is always afraid of everything. Similarly, when the Lord comes down, He imposes ignorance on Himself to enjoy the role. The actor should forget himself in the role if he wants to fully enjoy his character. Therefore, the Lord forgets His divine strength and acts like a Jeeva (soul), fearing the onslaught of troubles in this world.\\n\\nThe Veda says that fear is a characteristic of the limited soul (Atha tasya Bhayam Bhavati). Only by being fearful can the Lord fully enjoy and also do full justice to the role.\\n\\nIt is said that Goddess Parvati prepared the body of Ganapati and also introduced life into it. This statement has an inner spiritual meaning. Goddess Parvati represents Maya. When the Lord incarnates in this world, Maya prepares the human body and also introduces life, which is Para Prakriti, into it.\\n\\nTherefore, life or awareness is only a part of creation and is not Parabrahman. \\n\\nGanapati also shows five faces like Shiva. This indicates that Parabrahman indicated by the word Shiva has entered the human body. Ganapati is said to be the husband of Siddhi and Buddhi. Siddhi and Buddhi are not two ladies although they are symbolically shown to be so. \\n\\nBuddhi means knowledge associated with logical analysis. Siddhi means attainment. You have to attain the Lord in human form, who is the Satguru by logical analysis, so that you can eliminate fraud preachers. Siddhi means the attainment of the Lord in human form.\\n\\nYou should take the inner sense of Lord Ganesha’s story, which alone is the truth.\\n\\nScholars explain the concept in a symbolic language for the sake of illiterate and ignorant people. \\n\\nGanapati is said to be very brave, having stood against even Lord Shiva. This means that when the Lord is with full knowledge in His original form, He is fully aware of His divine strength. But when the head of Ganapati is replaced by the head of an elephant, He forgot all his divine strength and was afraid of everything. \\n\\nThis is a symbolic story. \\n\\nThe actual meaning is that the Lord in his original form is fully aware of Himself and His power. But when he comes down in human form, He forgets His divine strength and fears like an ordinary soul. This gives full enjoyment to the Lord in the human role. \\n\\nThe vehicle of the huge Ganapati is a small rat. This means that when you enter the service of the Lord, you need not think about your capacity to serve Him. By the will and power of the Lord, you’ll gain the capability to serve Him. You are just an external instrument and the Lord wants to give you divine fame. \\n\\nThe small rat carries the huge Ganapati and this is not due to the strength of the rat. It is only by the power of Ganapati that the small rat carries Him.\\n\\nIf you want to read more, you can find the original text can be found at:\\n\\nhttp://www.universal-spirituality.org/downloads/DivineDiscourses-3.pdf (page 6 onward)', \"Hi!

Hence, karma is also beginningless. There was no \"first\" point in time according to Dharmic philosophies.\\n\\n>Hinduism is not like Christianity or Islam who think that there is an absolute \"good\" and absolute \"evil\".\\n\\nChristianity and Islam, if this is what they hold, then fall prey to the following well-known dilemma:\\n\\nIs something good because Allah/Yahweh say so? Or did Allah/Yahweh say something was good and something else was bad because good/bad existed before Allah/Yahweh said so. Neither of these horns are rather welcome given Christianity and Islam\\'s insistence on creatio ex nihilo.', 'Doctrine of karma as described in mahabharatha by  draupadi to yudhistira states that a person\\'s immediate future is determined by\\n\\n1. Chance\\n2. Unforeseen consequences of past actions(samskara/adrsta phala)\\n3. Immediate consequences of current actions(drsta phala)\\n4. There is no fourth\\n\\n>1. Did brahma create n number of souls when he created our universe?\\n\\n Atman are neither created nor destroyed. \\n\\n>2. Was \\'0\\' karma alloted to each soul?\\n\\nAtman is beyond karma. If you are a jaina then the atman gets veiled by karma which clings to it as dirt. You can assign a 0 to this primordial state.\\n\\n>3. I was told that my soul chose my body because it that that it is now able to handle the difficulties. Does that mean more difficult life = more karma? If it is about the experience, there are infinite way a soul can experience difficulties in different ways. Won\\'t that be considered as an opportunity cost?\\n\\nAt every birth - an amount of karma is randomly  allocated from your karma backlog. This karma is called prarabdha and it contains both karma with beneficial consequences/phala and those with antagonistic consequences. Depending on the relative ratio - your life would vary from super easy mode to hell difficulty.\\n\\n\\n>4. Is it like a video game? Collect n number of karma to go to swarga, x for vaikuntha etc.?\\n\\nDepends on the denomination. Your good actions doesn\\'t override the bad ones. You go to swarga to enjoy the rewards that weren\\'t adequately rewarded and you go to naraka to get punished for that which were not adequately punished. Another interpretation  is that swarga is life on the world in super easy mode where you get everything for little effort and naraka is life on earth in hell mode where the world is out to screw you.\\n\\n>5. Who decides good or bad karma? Hinduism is not like Christianity or Islam who think that there is an absolute \"good\" and absolute \"evil\".\\n\\nAll actions have consequences. Beneficial vs Antagonistic is more appropriatethan good vs bad in my opinion. Causality doesn\\'t necessarily need an ishvara - so answer varies with denomination \\n\\n\\n>6. How does my karma up till now affect my current life?\\n\\nIt affects by determining the difficulty for every task and prunes the game tree accordingly. Now let us say you want to give an exam - if you have very good prarabdha then you can score 100 by studying the night before exam. If your prarabdha is very negative then you may barely pass by studying very hard throughout the year. \\n\\n\\n>7. As I mentioned earlier, according someone on this sub, my soul chose this body to experience something. So is that soul bound to choose from certain bodies whose lives will be somewhat similar (according to their astrology, which I assume the soul knows how to read). Bound to choose from a set of bodies whose life paths and the soul\\'s karma match?\\n\\n In samkhya yes the Purusha gets entangled with a body to experience something. This is a divine mystery. Atleast the samkhya school believes it is the prakriti not the Purusha that determines what the body should be depending on all that the Purusha has experienced to give the purusha a more comprehensive experience so the atma doesn\\'t exactly choose a body.', \"There will be varying answers, so take all with a grain of salt.

Maya in simple terms is defined as space, time and causation. All the objective quantities in the universe which we can perceive through our senses and mind (in the form of thoughts, beliefs, etc) all come under Maya. Within maya, one objective quantity can be simplified and explained in terms of other objective quantity.  In particular, all your questions regarding karma are of this type.\\n\\nBut all of maya is just an appearance of the ultimate truth; Atman(which is very loosely translated as soul, whose meaning varies from context to context), which encompasses all the objective happenings in maya. The Atman is not an object, rather, it is that which illumines every objective experience in maya. Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya.

The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis. Many of them go this way because, they cannot just simply accept what someone tells them, they need to see it, feel it, make it, experience it and realise and understand it themselves. A fervent need for intellectual stimulation. \\n\\nFor someone like this, is Bhakti yoga really viable ? are Bhakti and jnana from a broad perspective just diametrically opposite to one another?  On a simplistic level, the Bhakti yogi is less likely to question things as the jnana yogi is to accept things as is. \\n\\nAre these two things opposed to the other? What does reconciliation of these two really mean, does it mean you give up on one of the paths ? What prevents the jnana yogi from being able to surrender, is it the ego ? the notion of  \"I have to know, I have to find out\" ? I\\'d love to hear your thoughts on this.', '[deleted]', '\"The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation\"  \\n\\n\\nLmao what a joke xD', 'A great path for those who make the mind reflective and pure.

Making the mind pure and clear with truths is a fine path.', 'Monk Academy&#x200B;\\n\\nI am an twenty-year-old full-time monk (brahmacari) living in our monastery in upstate NY. My name is Tirtha. I joined the temple a year ago and my life has completely transformed. Before coming here I was a confused young boy, who had just finished school. I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.). But by the mercy of my teachers, I was able to transform my life and become a better person. Although I have just started my path. I can confidently say that my life is meaningful and it has a deep purpose. I am happy, therefore I want to share this opportunity with others.\\n\\nBrahmacharya is a life of a monk, it\\'s a commitment to restrict oneself from sense gratification, and focus on your spiritual growth. Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek. There is a beautiful lake right next to us and breathtaking waterfalls just a few minutes away. It is a peaceful, quiet, and relaxing environment that is perfect for our spiritual practice.\\n\\nThis is exactly what we are doing in our ashram (temple). We are training young men (from 18 years old) to become strong, responsible individuals in our society. We are studying Vedic scriptures, under the guidance of our teacher Rasik Mohan Prabhu who is a lifelong monk, and who lived in a monastery in India for 16 years of his life. Every day we are practicing yoga and meditation. We also have a lot of service (seva) to do. Our project started only a year and a half ago. We have a lot of things to do and we are also open to new possibilities.\\n\\nWe are also learning many different arts and skills such as yoga, meditation, visualization, construction, painting, building, gardening, book publication, writing, singing, artistic skills, memorizing verses, studying different scriptures, public speaking, and many other things.\\n\\nSo as a resident of the monastery I am inviting every young man who is interested to come and learn how to think like a monk, and most importantly how to live like a monk.\\n\\nIf you are interested or have any questions you can write here or contact me: brotherhoodofmonks@gmail.com\\n\\nNamaste,\\n\\nTirtha', 'Am I correct in understanding that you belong to the gauDIya vaiShNava sampradAya but not to ISKCON?', 'I wish more young people would take up monkhood in a traditional way.', 'Today I saw a short video on youtube about Shiva being played in a game.

For a time we identify with the roles being played as real characters (when in reality they are just actors).\\n\\nAren't we into the role of our self (lower-case 's') right now and can't we enjoy expansion of that self in love and being free?\", 'Much of this confusion is due to promiscuous usage of language. Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point. Till we attain moksha which is the same as realizing that we are eternally Brahman, the normal rules of morality, human ends, meaning etc all apply. \\n\\nTo give an example, we all know that the world is made of fundamental particles of various kinds. However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels.

Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing.

So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings.

Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives.

Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan.

Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes. This then to us regular ppl appears as someone having a really really sh\\\\*tty life full of misery, suffering, etc. SO Karma indeed is the answer but there are nuances within that as well.', \"4. The creature experiencing the evil is an incarnation of God, taking on the pain for some reason that will be known later.\\n\\nExample: the Ramayana\\n\\nAlso, I don't really consider 2 or 3 to be reasons for evil to exist. They are just incidental side effects of 1: Karma.\", \"I would argue that a omnibenevelant God would do bad in the interest of good by helping us grow through suffering. As demonstrated by yin and yan, there is good in bad and bad in good. So I would extend your reincarnation point to growth within a single life, as well as over multiple life times.\\n\\nThe point of good and evil being illusionary is interesting. I understand its called illusionary as we as humans conceptualise everything and as we do our definitions are out of touch with the way things are, it's not actually saying that these things don't exist. This teaching is only calling for a deeper understanding into reality, such as, can evil be classed as inheriently bad if its nessesary for good to exist?\", \"I've never heard of this 'well known' argument.

This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe).

Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality\\n\\nSo literally doing anything at all goes against non-duality? In which case, Shankara who wrote volumes of literature and spent his entire life debating people would also be pretty non-advaitic. You sound like some edgy nihilist who just discovered buddhism.\\n\\n\\nThe brahman maybe formless but it's not some dead and static inertia where literally nothing happens.

To sum it up it\\'s a long-running jrpg series that is usually set in an apocalyptic setting and revolves around ideological conflict, this includes:\\n\\n1. The law side which fights for order and archives to create a socialist utopia represented by the judeo-christian angels\\n\\n2. It\\'s opposition, the Chaos faction that strives to create a dystopian anarchy so \"only the strong can survive\" and limitless freedom can be accomplished that is represented by the judeo-christian fallen angels/demons\\n\\n3. and the neutral side which denounces both so humanity can follow the best of both sides, which results in it being unstable and suseptable to more ideological wars, and is represented by humans and sometimes even random pagan gods and goddesses.\\n\\nNow, some of you may be familiar to [this little controversy](http://nichegamer.com/2016/02/03/hindus-are-pissed-that-krishna-is-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final/) that happened over a year ago (i\\'m not sure how repeatable the source is, so take it with a grain of salt), which actually inspired me to write this post so i can present what krishna is in-game to those not familiar with it. To begin, i\\'ll just say he\\'s more than just a summonable ally, he plays a major role in the story actually.\\n\\nnow that i\\'ve quickly boiled down the basics of the series, maybe you are wondering what that role in the latest game is. Well, i can\\'t really do this without spoiling the game\\'s plot, but here i go: after he is unsealed he preaches about how yahweh trapped souls into the material realm so they are forced to cling to him via the circle of law-chaos (i could go more into detail, but that\\'d make this post a lot longer than it already is). Krishna\\'s plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy. But no such luck with Krishna, he\\'s simply a forced antagonist who you can\\'t side with.\\n\\nand the last thing i will talk about, the character design: now, [his regular form](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/8/8d/SMT_IV_FINAL_Krishna.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025173647) is a pretty good design personally, and along with being very expressive it does a good job conveying his charming, calm but also snarky and sometimes sarcastic. i\\'m not sure whether i\\'d say \"that\\'s Krishna\" the first time i saw his design, but he definitely feels like krishna when i look at him (at least to me)\\n\\nBut his [vishnu](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_B_SMT4A.jpg) [designs](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_II_SMTIVA_Official_Art.jpg) seem to go more with the forced antagonist role he plays in the story; maybe the design is referencing something i don\\'t know, but with the \"nandakas\" in the second form that really look more like lightsabers, i can\\'t help but to look at vishnu and think \"what is he, a sith lord?\" Kinda discredits him as a god of preservation when his design seems to just say *evil*\\n\\nSo that about wraps it up, but as a note i should say that my goal is not to upset or get anyone offended with this post. i\\'m just curious to see what this community thinks of Krishna\\'s whole portrayal in this game. is it faithful to his origins or not? is this offensive or are these just silly video games that shouldn\\'t be taken seriously?

I am enchanted.', '[deleted]', 'Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism# Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism\\n\\nsource: paraphrased from several talks by Swami Paramarthananda.\\n\\nThere is a lot of confusion around the necessity and role of Vedas and guru in Hinduism.  These are some common questions that people have.\\n\\n1. Why do I need to study the Vedas?\\n2. Is a guru really necessary?\\n3. Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\\n\\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\\n\\n>tadviddhi praṇipātēna paripraśnēna sēvayā |  \\n>  \\n>upadēkṣyanti tē jñānaṁ jñāninastattvadarśinaḥ || 4.34||  \\n>  \\n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus? How do know that am not a guru?', '[deleted]', 'Very great post, and finding a Guru is one of the most valuable steps a seeker can take.\\n\\nAn important point is to not to treat acceptance of a guru casually and make a quick decision(something which happens a lot these days, sometimes followed by regrets). This is much more important than even something like marriage, and it is not considered good to leave and accept another person as Guru.  The student is usually encourage to spend some time testing and only when convinced at heart,  to commit to someone as Guru and be fully dedicated to their teachings.\\n\\nAlso, we need more guidance about sadhanas that somebody who hasnt yet found their Guru can do, how to find sadhanas which get you close to the Guru principle/tattva,  like Guru Gita, stotras to Dattatreya or Dakshinamurty,', 'Thank you for writing!', 'Indeed satsang (company of learned people) is very helpful.

Those who live by these four attain happiness irrespective of what race, religion,ethnicity, region, gender you belong.  \\n', 'Hinduism isn\\'t one religion. it\\'s more of an umbrella term. you see, when the Persians first invaded India, they referred to people in the valley on the other side of the Indus River as \"Hindus\". later, when other groups came into contact with the Indian subcontinent, they referred to the religious practices of the people there as \"Hindu religion\". these people had various different beliefs, practices, gods, and so on, including the Brahman religion as well as many others. it wans\\'t until after the colonization of India by the British Empire, and the subsequent call for an Independent India (then called Hindustan), that the people there really began to form the idea of a united Hinduism. \\n\\nHinduism, as a term, is a recognized world religion, but it still encompasses many different religions and schools of philosophy. there are the Vaishnavas who believe that Vishnu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead; there are the Shaivites who believe it is Shiva who is Supreme Personality of God; there are the Shaktas who believe Shakti is the Supreme Personality, with different schools believing that it is either her form Kali or her form Devi; and there are Smartists who believe that there is no single Supreme Personality, and that each person chooses their own God to be representative personality of God to them.\\n\\nthere are Hindu schools of thought that claim God is singular and manifests in many incarnations as the other gods and demigods; there are those who believe that God is entirely impersonal and exists in all things and is synonymous with the Universe; there are those who believe that there is one Supreme God and many lesser gods beneath him.\\n\\nsome believe that your station in life (everything from your financial status, to your caste if any, to your species) depends on you karma from your previous life. if you were evil or sinful then you will be born into a lower station or even as an animal, bird or reptile, insect, plant, or even a rock. these people believe that only humans have free will and responsibility and can sense God; others believe that you can reincarnate into various species with no rhyme or reason, and that your social station is not entirely based on your karma from a previous life, but can be changed in this life through good works.\\n\\nthe common ultimate goal of all Hindus is generally to achieve Moksha and end the cycle of reincarnation. this is interpreted differently for each Hindu. some believe that you go to a sort of Paradise lke Heaven. some believe that you join with God and lose all Ego and sense of individual identity. some believe that Moksha is like Nirvana and you are simply enlightened and don\\'t have to die to enjoy the bliss that comes with it. however, there are even a few Hindus who believe that ending the cycle of Samsara is selfish, and instead seek to merely Love and give eternal devotion to God. I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house. I have come to Hinduism after a long exploration of other religions since my teens. ', \"Hinduism is difficult to understand in few short paras or even book. For example, many hindus will refute your claim about it being polytheistic, stating all those gods/demi-gods etc are just manifestation of one power which is formless and attribute-less (some hindus will claim one god but with attribute and form instead). Coming from abrahamic religions, people get confused with not-so-well-defined aspects of Hinduism, so I recommend reading some publications from Hinduism Today which clarifies Hinduism in detail. http://www.hinduismtoday.com \\n\\nAdding to /u/storytimesover response -\\nSwastika - considered auspicious among Hindus, still used a lot even though world sees it differently. This documentary might be of help - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbeYIBT9XVc\\n\\nGanesha - considered to be God of wisdom and remover of obstacles (that's why you'll ganesha idol in majority of cars owned by Hindus). May be this might help although it's a long read - http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1366. Google will show many more perspective of Ganesha. \\n\\nWeird rules - depends on perspective\\n\\nMeaning of life - that question is essence of Hinduism, not the god/deities/rituals/rules. Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred. Offer your food to the god you wish to please (offering to Krishna pleases all the gods).\\n\\nReincarnation: Your next vessel is a result of the karma (action) of this life and previous lives. You can overcome reincarnation by returning to Godhead/Krishnaloka/Vaikuntha.\\n\\nThe meaning of life, in my opinion, is to live for Krishna and create a better world for all living entities.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha. So end of Mahabharata brings about a change not just in the rulers of Hatinapur but gave a new direction to the entire the then future of India wherein not just a new power  arose to rule but also a different philosophy which was Non-Vedic in nature gained prominence.

Reading the spark note esk back story on the devas made we want to look up and learn more about them and what they represent. I was an athiest for several and had tried other religions and philosophies before as I've stated before , without feeling the tiniest sliver of anything. Then after reading the Mahabharata and the Ramayana I prayed for a sign that this was the proper path for me and was answered! And now I'm way happier than I ever was with anything else and I owe it all to Smite getting that going.

One is supposed to approach him through devotion alone.\\n\\nDo you see the contrast between this and when he is a 'cool' character in a video game and does 'cool' stuff. Though Rama is the main figure in Ramayana, he is not a character from a book. He is viewed by many as God who is to be revered, to be worshipped. Hence the perceived offence.\\n\\nThat aside, Hindu gods do have a ton of qualities that make them nice video game material. And personally, I kind of agree with the  company president's statement.

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \\n\\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \\n\\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\\n\\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\\n\\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\\n\\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \\n\\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*']\n",

Unwholesome thoughts prime us/increase the likelihood of us to commit unwholesome actions that would then result in paap.\\n\\nI believe the effect of violent video games on human psyche  is a subject of active academic research. Current research is non conclusive in either direction if I remember correctly. Virtual world might offer an alternate avenue to relieve stress hence making said individual more unlikely to commit real world aggression but this doesn't say anything about if that individual is experiencing an overall uptick in aggressive impulses which he/she then satisfies via more gaming. You can read more about them in their respective websites/articles etc. You can also look into studies that investigate how pornography and the type of pornography affects the psyche and if this is correlated with rape crimes. I believe the underlying mechanisms should be similar for all these virtual stimuli.\", 'Dear u/Procambara, \\n\\nI saved this question and took me a couple of days of reasoning out in the back of my brain to finally answer. \\n\\nHow do you define “killing” of something that has no life to begin with? \\n\\nMake a shape of a human in a block of wood. \\nNow casts it into the fire. \\n\\nDid you kill it? \\nNo. Because it’s just “wood”. \\nMaybe you could argue you killed “wood” but not a man, that is, the shape of a man into the wood. \\n\\nKilling a virtual character is not different. \\nYou can’t kill something that had no life to being with, it’s like throwing a block of wood into the fire. \\n\\nWe define killing of a virtual character based on some false information we got; the character is made to emulate a real living being while it carries absolutely no life in it. \\nIf you installed a set of mechanisms inside the block of wood and made it walk; do you consider it alive? \\n\\nNow let us see the killer instead. \\n\\nThere’s no killing at all because even the killer is not alive. \\nYou control another piece of wood that cast another into fire; let’s call it piece K for Killer and piece V for victim. \\n\\nDid K just kill V? None of them has any life into it. \\nYou are just interacting with nothing more than logs of wood.\\n\\nTo define “killing” a living entity must be present and must be defined as the killer; another living being instead will be called the victim. \\nWithout one of these no killing is possible. \\n\\nIt’s how we define killing that shapes the actions and therefore Karma. \\nAssuming a virtual character has life in it is just a mistake based on a “simulated liveness” which of course is nothing more than a mere illusion. \\n\\nPeace.', 'want to know all about karma1.

If it is about the experience, there are infinite way a soul can experience difficulties in different ways. Won\\'t that be considered as an opportunity cost?\\n\\nAt every birth - an amount of karma is randomly  allocated from your karma backlog. This karma is called prarabdha and it contains both karma with beneficial consequences/phala and those with antagonistic consequences. Depending on the relative ratio - your life would vary from super easy mode to hell difficulty.\\n\\n\\n>4. Is it like a video game? Collect n number of karma to go to swarga, x for vaikuntha etc.?\\n\\nDepends on the denomination. Your good actions doesn\\'t override the bad ones. You go to swarga to enjoy the rewards that weren\\'t adequately rewarded and you go to naraka to get punished for that which were not adequately punished. Another interpretation  is that swarga is life on the world in super easy mode where you get everything for little effort and naraka is life on earth in hell mode where the world is out to screw you.\\n\\n>5. Who decides good or bad karma? Hinduism is not like Christianity or Islam who think that there is an absolute \"good\" and absolute \"evil\".\\n\\nAll actions have consequences. Beneficial vs Antagonistic is more appropriatethan good vs bad in my opinion. Causality doesn\\'t necessarily need an ishvara - so answer varies with denomination \\n\\n\\n>6. How does my karma up till now affect my current life?\\n\\nIt affects by determining the difficulty for every task and prunes the game tree accordingly. Now let us say you want to give an exam - if you have very good prarabdha then you can score 100 by studying the night before exam. If your prarabdha is very negative then you may barely pass by studying very hard throughout the year. \\n\\n\\n>7.

So is that soul bound to choose from certain bodies whose lives will be somewhat similar (according to their astrology, which I assume the soul knows how to read). Bound to choose from a set of bodies whose life paths and the soul\\'s karma match?\\n\\n In samkhya yes the Purusha gets entangled with a body to experience something. This is a divine mystery. Atleast the samkhya school believes it is the prakriti not the Purusha that determines what the body should be depending on all that the Purusha has experienced to give the purusha a more comprehensive experience so the atma doesn\\'t exactly choose a body.', \"There will be varying answers, so take all with a grain of salt.

Maya in simple terms is defined as space, time and causation. All the objective quantities in the universe which we can perceive through our senses and mind (in the form of thoughts, beliefs, etc) all come under Maya. Within maya, one objective quantity can be simplified and explained in terms of other objective quantity.  In particular, all your questions regarding karma are of this type.\\n\\nBut all of maya is just an appearance of the ultimate truth; Atman(which is very loosely translated as soul, whose meaning varies from context to context), which encompasses all the objective happenings in maya. The Atman is not an object, rather, it is that which illumines every objective experience in maya. Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya. Try to go beyond Maya — break free the bondage by associating our self with body and mind.', 'I started a series on this exact topic.

My name is Tirtha. I joined the temple a year ago and my life has completely transformed. Before coming here I was a confused young boy, who had just finished school. I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.). But by the mercy of my teachers, I was able to transform my life and become a better person. Although I have just started my path. I can confidently say that my life is meaningful and it has a deep purpose. I am happy, therefore I want to share this opportunity with others.\\n\\nBrahmacharya is a life of a monk, it\\'s a commitment to restrict oneself from sense gratification, and focus on your spiritual growth. Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek. There is a beautiful lake right next to us and breathtaking waterfalls just a few minutes away. It is a peaceful, quiet, and relaxing environment that is perfect for our spiritual practice.\\n\\nThis is exactly what we are doing in our ashram (temple). We are training young men (from 18 years old) to become strong, responsible individuals in our society. We are studying Vedic scriptures, under the guidance of our teacher Rasik Mohan Prabhu who is a lifelong monk, and who lived in a monastery in India for 16 years of his life. Every day we are practicing yoga and meditation. We also have a lot of service (seva) to do. Our project started only a year and a half ago. We have a lot of things to do and we are also open to new possibilities.\\n\\nWe are also learning many different arts and skills such as yoga, meditation, visualization, construction, painting, building, gardening, book publication, writing, singing, artistic skills, memorizing verses, studying different scriptures, public speaking, and many other things.\\n\\nSo as a resident of the monastery I am inviting every young man who is interested to come and learn how to think like a monk, and most importantly how to live like a monk.\\n\\nIf you are interested or have any questions you can write here or contact me: brotherhoodofmonks@gmail.com\\n\\nNamaste,\\n\\nTirtha', 'Am I correct in understanding that you belong to the gauDIya vaiShNava sampradAya but not to ISKCON?', 'I wish more young people would take up monkhood in a traditional way.', 'Bhagwan Shiva and Bhagwan Ganesha in game , your thoughts , video link in comments', 'Namaste, thank you for the submission.

Good times.\", 'I will definitely play this game', 'JUST WOW !!!!', 'Gyaan Yoga - The Path of Knowledge**A Surprising Discovery**\\n\\nIt is surprising to me that there are not more posts here about Gyaan Yoga: The Path of Knowledge. The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis.

Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point.

However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels. All this everything is me etc is just a vessel to carry you to the truth and the vessel has to be abandoned one day, too. Like a boat, incredibly useful - to the other side of the river, then you abandon it and walk.\\n\\nWe use a thorn analogy, we use a thorn (advaita vedanta) to remove another thorn (human suffering) and then we discard both.\\n\\nAll this I am consciousness and everyone is me, etc etc will be refined and transformed. There is no I, consciousness is not an I. The I is the ego it\\'s ahaṃkara and consciousness is something completely different. The fact you can see the object of I-ness is proof it is not pure consciousness.\\n\\nReality is nondual, it\\'s not perceivable unless you\\'re using a mind to have transactions but the mind will limit you to a perspective of reality that is from the point of view of the mind. Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing. This disqualifies it\\'s classification of being nihilistic. Since nihilism has a \"no point\" sort of feel, and in Vedanta we believe existence is the point. Vedanta adds meaning to life, it doesn\\'t remove it.', 'What you said isn\\'t true for just Advaita Vedanta, it is true for all of Vedanta. The point that \"whatever I do is a barrier for moksha\". While it is true that the perception of \"being the only conscious being\" is not exactly the best way to word Advaita, still what you said is shared by all schools of Vedanta. \\n\\nI was going to give you a detailed answer backed up from Bhagavad Gita. But, Vashishta Muni already has answered this question when teaching Bhagavan Sri Rama. Hence it seems best that he should answer your doubt as well directly. \\n\\n[Refutation of Fatalism - Yoga Vashishta](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/yoga-vasistha-english/d/doc118039.html)\\n\\nYou can read the preceding 5 chapters to get an understanding of the basis for it if you wish. This would have the answer though. \\n\\n\\n\\nJai Sita Rama', 'Knowing that this is maya or imagined reality through anubhava is only one half of awakening. The other half is the remembrance of who you are.', 'It\\'s a beautiful question, the questioner\\'s mind has popped out of the closed box mindset, it lets me guess. Because if the question was asking for parallels between Buddhism(shoonyavad) and nihilism it would just be an ordinary philosophy class question.\\nBut the fact that the two, Advaita Vedanta and Nihilism might have some parallel, even such confusion is an insight.\\nAnd I would like to consider them one by one, so to start with Advaita Vedanta, I would like to quote a phrase from Adi Shankaracharya, \\n\"Brahman Satya Jagat Mithya, Jeevo Brahmaiv Na Parah.\"\\nThis translates to Brahman alone is real, the universe(or world) is unreal, and the individual self is no other than Brahman itself(the supreme self).\\nFor nihilism, I would like to define it as the following \"extreme scepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real existence.\"\\nSo the common thing between them is the negative value ascribed to the existence. \\nBut nihilism only ends there and has no other conclusion to draw from this fact.\\nWhile Advaita Vedanta, though says the world is unreal, but it has a conclusion, or an assertion to make regarding the reality of the individual. So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings. This is ego, made possible by mind and the senses, powered by intellect. \\n\\nThere are two ways I can describe our situation-\\n\\nA. Video game  \\nB. Dream\\n\\nIn all this \\'video game\\' we are a part of, we often forget ourselves, playing hours and hours (lives), initially remembering ourselves, but just for fun. Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives. He stabs you in the chest and you see that another person was watching impassively neither helping you nor the other guy. Now you wake up. Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan. You and the countless others before you and after you are the same, parts of dream of Vishnu. Now, you might think, why should I suffer for his Leela? He ain\\'t paying my emi nor helping me deal with office politics. But remember, in your dreams of fear and pleasure, everything was in your head, you imagined juvenile things with your latest crush or saving the world with iron man. They are not true, but your perspective in dream know it. The ego won\\'t allow that. And that leads to all the \"suffering\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>It also terrifies me to think that under all the layers of personality I think of as \"me\", there is really just a single consciousness, the same in everyone. \\n\\nWhy would \"you\" feel terrified when \"you\" in your thoughts and feelings, insecurities and securities, the physical and mental manifestation is but a dream? When \"you\" come out of the ego that there is neither \"I\" nor \"you\", there is no world but just a dream, everything in Brahman and everything from Brahman, every thought, action and feeling from him, why would \"you\" \"feel\" anything at all?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI would suggest you to read Bhagawad Gita (I read the translation by Swami Sivananda and checked any doubts in YugalSarkar website). If you could think this much, that is the will of God that your character is to come out from the game.

', 'your thoughts on the portrayal of Krishna in Shin Megami Tensei IV: ApocalypseI presume most of you aren\\'t familiar with the video game series: shin megami tensei (smt for short). To sum it up it\\'s a long-running jrpg series that is usually set in an apocalyptic setting and revolves around ideological conflict, this includes:\\n\\n1. The law side which fights for order and archives to create a socialist utopia represented by the judeo-christian angels\\n\\n2. It\\'s opposition, the Chaos faction that strives to create a dystopian anarchy so \"only the strong can survive\" and limitless freedom can be accomplished that is represented by the judeo-christian fallen angels/demons\\n\\n3. and the neutral side which denounces both so humanity can follow the best of both sides, which results in it being unstable and suseptable to more ideological wars, and is represented by humans and sometimes even random pagan gods and goddesses.\\n\\nNow, some of you may be familiar to [this little controversy](http://nichegamer.com/2016/02/03/hindus-are-pissed-that-krishna-is-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final/) that happened over a year ago (i\\'m not sure how repeatable the source is, so take it with a grain of salt), which actually inspired me to write this post so i can present what krishna is in-game to those not familiar with it. To begin, i\\'ll just say he\\'s more than just a summonable ally, he plays a major role in the story actually.\\n\\nnow that i\\'ve quickly boiled down the basics of the series, maybe you are wondering what that role in the latest game is. Well, i can\\'t really do this without spoiling the game\\'s plot, but here i go: after he is unsealed he preaches about how yahweh trapped souls into the material realm so they are forced to cling to him via the circle of law-chaos (i could go more into detail, but that\\'d make this post a lot longer than it already is). Krishna\\'s plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy. But no such luck with Krishna, he\\'s simply a forced antagonist who you can\\'t side with.\\n\\nand the last thing i will talk about, the character design: now, [his regular form](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/8/8d/SMT_IV_FINAL_Krishna.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025173647) is a pretty good design personally, and along with being very expressive it does a good job conveying his charming, calm but also snarky and sometimes sarcastic. i\\'m not sure whether i\\'d say \"that\\'s Krishna\" the first time i saw his design, but he definitely feels like krishna when i look at him (at least to me)\\n\\nBut his [vishnu](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_B_SMT4A.jpg) [designs](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_II_SMTIVA_Official_Art.jpg) seem to go more with the forced antagonist role he plays in the story; maybe the design is referencing something i don\\'t know, but with the \"nandakas\" in the second form that really look more like lightsabers, i can\\'t help but to look at vishnu and think \"what is he, a sith lord?\" Kinda discredits him as a god of preservation when his design seems to just say *evil*\\n\\nSo that about wraps it up, but as a note i should say that my goal is not to upset or get anyone offended with this post. i\\'m just curious to see what this community thinks of Krishna\\'s whole portrayal in this game. is it faithful to his origins or not? is this offensive or are these just silly video games that shouldn\\'t be taken seriously?

L. Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes.

This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe). It is more like Kashmir Shaivism and other similar traditions.\", \"Advaita Vedanta is a beautifully rich tradition, but I fear it often becomes the most popular choice for people (often westerners) who are simply shopping around for interesting philosophies. \\n\\nRemember to ground your understanding in some sort of real practice or Sadhana, otherwise it's just intellectual gymnastics. \", '[deleted]', \">you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ‘you’ stay in this material world and utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' (the impeccably designed video game).

Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality\\n\\nSo literally doing anything at all goes against non-duality? In which case, Shankara who wrote volumes of literature and spent his entire life debating people would also be pretty non-advaitic. You sound like some edgy nihilist who just discovered buddhism.\\n\\n\\nThe brahman maybe formless but it's not some dead and static inertia where literally nothing happens. In kashmiri shaivism, the idea of constant internal movement - spanda - is the defining characteristic of the highest non-dual reality, as it is of the grossest reality.\", 'Jcink Roleplay - Hinduism ElementsIf you don\\'t know - a roleplay on a message board (like Jcink or Proboards) is essentially writing parts of a story with friends online (you write part of it, then a friend will respond and write the next part, and it goes from there, piece by piece). \\n\\nPantheons (Greek/Roman, Norse, just to name a few) are a fun subject to explore with this type of collaborative writing setting.\\n\\n**I had a friend that wanted to make a roleplay but involve the Hindu pantheon in some shape or form (modern day gods on earth, children of the gods, mortals blessed with the god\\'s powers through blessed items, etc.).

I am enchanted.', '[deleted]', 'Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism# Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism\\n\\nsource: paraphrased from several talks by Swami Paramarthananda.\\n\\nThere is a lot of confusion around the necessity and role of Vedas and guru in Hinduism.  These are some common questions that people have.\\n\\n1. Why do I need to study the Vedas?\\n2. Is a guru really necessary?\\n3. Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\\n\\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\\n\\n>tadviddhi praṇipātēna paripraśnēna sēvayā |  \\n>  \\n>upadēkṣyanti tē jñānaṁ jñāninastattvadarśinaḥ || 4.34||  \\n>  \\n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus? How do know that am not a guru?', '[deleted]', 'Very great post, and finding a Guru is one of the most valuable steps a seeker can take.\\n\\nAn important point is to not to treat acceptance of a guru casually and make a quick decision(something which happens a lot these days, sometimes followed by regrets). This is much more important than even something like marriage, and it is not considered good to leave and accept another person as Guru.  The student is usually encourage to spend some time testing and only when convinced at heart,  to commit to someone as Guru and be fully dedicated to their teachings.\\n\\nAlso, we need more guidance about sadhanas that somebody who hasnt yet found their Guru can do, how to find sadhanas which get you close to the Guru principle/tattva,  like Guru Gita, stotras to Dattatreya or Dakshinamurty,', 'Thank you for writing!', 'Indeed satsang (company of learned people) is very helpful.

Those who live by these four attain happiness irrespective of what race, religion,ethnicity, region, gender you belong.  \\n', 'Hinduism isn\\'t one religion. it\\'s more of an umbrella term. you see, when the Persians first invaded India, they referred to people in the valley on the other side of the Indus River as \"Hindus\". later, when other groups came into contact with the Indian subcontinent, they referred to the religious practices of the people there as \"Hindu religion\". these people had various different beliefs, practices, gods, and so on, including the Brahman religion as well as many others. it wans\\'t until after the colonization of India by the British Empire, and the subsequent call for an Independent India (then called Hindustan), that the people there really began to form the idea of a united Hinduism. \\n\\nHinduism, as a term, is a recognized world religion, but it still encompasses many different religions and schools of philosophy. there are the Vaishnavas who believe that Vishnu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead; there are the Shaivites who believe it is Shiva who is Supreme Personality of God; there are the Shaktas who believe Shakti is the Supreme Personality, with different schools believing that it is either her form Kali or her form Devi; and there are Smartists who believe that there is no single Supreme Personality, and that each person chooses their own God to be representative personality of God to them.\\n\\nthere are Hindu schools of thought that claim God is singular and manifests in many incarnations as the other gods and demigods; there are those who believe that God is entirely impersonal and exists in all things and is synonymous with the Universe; there are those who believe that there is one Supreme God and many lesser gods beneath him.\\n\\nsome believe that your station in life (everything from your financial status, to your caste if any, to your species) depends on you karma from your previous life. if you were evil or sinful then you will be born into a lower station or even as an animal, bird or reptile, insect, plant, or even a rock. these people believe that only humans have free will and responsibility and can sense God; others believe that you can reincarnate into various species with no rhyme or reason, and that your social station is not entirely based on your karma from a previous life, but can be changed in this life through good works.\\n\\nthe common ultimate goal of all Hindus is generally to achieve Moksha and end the cycle of reincarnation. this is interpreted differently for each Hindu. some believe that you go to a sort of Paradise lke Heaven. some believe that you join with God and lose all Ego and sense of individual identity. some believe that Moksha is like Nirvana and you are simply enlightened and don\\'t have to die to enjoy the bliss that comes with it. however, there are even a few Hindus who believe that ending the cycle of Samsara is selfish, and instead seek to merely Love and give eternal devotion to God. I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house. I have come to Hinduism after a long exploration of other religions since my teens. ', \"Hinduism is difficult to understand in few short paras or even book. For example, many hindus will refute your claim about it being polytheistic, stating all those gods/demi-gods etc are just manifestation of one power which is formless and attribute-less (some hindus will claim one god but with attribute and form instead). Coming from abrahamic religions, people get confused with not-so-well-defined aspects of Hinduism, so I recommend reading some publications from Hinduism Today which clarifies Hinduism in detail. http://www.hinduismtoday.com \\n\\nAdding to /u/storytimesover response -\\nSwastika - considered auspicious among Hindus, still used a lot even though world sees it differently. This documentary might be of help - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbeYIBT9XVc\\n\\nGanesha - considered to be God of wisdom and remover of obstacles (that's why you'll ganesha idol in majority of cars owned by Hindus). May be this might help although it's a long read - http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1366. Google will show many more perspective of Ganesha. \\n\\nWeird rules - depends on perspective\\n\\nMeaning of life - that question is essence of Hinduism, not the god/deities/rituals/rules. Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred. Offer your food to the god you wish to please (offering to Krishna pleases all the gods).\\n\\nReincarnation: Your next vessel is a result of the karma (action) of this life and previous lives. You can overcome reincarnation by returning to Godhead/Krishnaloka/Vaikuntha.\\n\\nThe meaning of life, in my opinion, is to live for Krishna and create a better world for all living entities.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha. So end of Mahabharata brings about a change not just in the rulers of Hatinapur but gave a new direction to the entire the then future of India wherein not just a new power  arose to rule but also a different philosophy which was Non-Vedic in nature gained prominence.

I understand that I'm not saying its not a valid stance. However Smite is what sparked the fire with my conversion to Hinduism. Reading the spark note esk back story on the devas made we want to look up and learn more about them and what they represent. I was an athiest for several and had tried other religions and philosophies before as I've stated before , without feeling the tiniest sliver of anything. Then after reading the Mahabharata and the Ramayana I prayed for a sign that this was the proper path for me and was answered! And now I'm way happier than I ever was with anything else and I owe it all to Smite getting that going. So with both main sides being addressed(obviously its not just a two side question) what does everyone else think about it?\", 'I want Hindu Gods and Goddesses to be used in video games because it increases the exposure to a different audience.\\n\\nI do find offensive the World of Warcraft, the most popular MMORPG, depiction of Goddess Kali imagery as a demon and they even have a NPC known as [Jagganath](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=90458/jagganath#screenshots) who need to be slain for the players to progress. ', \"I understand how someone might find the video portrayal a bit offensive. It is sort of trivialising. \\n\\nTake for example Sri Rama.

One is supposed to approach him through devotion alone.\\n\\nDo you see the contrast between this and when he is a 'cool' character in a video game and does 'cool' stuff. Though Rama is the main figure in Ramayana, he is not a character from a book. He is viewed by many as God who is to be revered, to be worshipped. Hence the perceived offence.\\n\\nThat aside, Hindu gods do have a ton of qualities that make them nice video game material. And personally, I kind of agree with the  company president's statement.  And anyway it is not like offended people will blow themselves up and kill someone.

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \\n\\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \\n\\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\\n\\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\\n\\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\\n\\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \\n\\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*', '\"you are the universe experiencing itself\"', 'Namaste, thank you for the submission.

Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya. Try to go beyond Maya — break free the bondage by associating our self with body and mind.', 'I started a series on this exact topic.

Do you know the reasons for not eating meat or fasting for certain periods?\\n\\nAttending temple is certainly not mandatory **BUT**  the temple is a place to attune spiritual energies. Just as how many people choose to go to the gym instead of working out at home, attending places that serve a purpose attune your mind to a different frequency.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, you are a teenager and will be questioning everything. The answers are there.', \"It's tough being a teenager these days. Your parents are just doing what they think is right for you. I wouldn't be too hard on them. Still, you have your own life to live, and some day you'll be independent. I recommend a book for you called 'Life Skills for Hindu Teens' published by Himalayan Academy. It's free to read on-line, and you might get something out of it. One of the stories (it's written as fiction, with lessons inside each story) is almost exactly your dilemma. \\n\\nGood luck. May you find a happy compromise that suits both you and your parents.\", 'Hahaha a Hindu is someone who destroys their own ignorance. We are seekers of truth and integrity is a huge part of that. If you want someone else’s words about it, I say if you want to be more empowered then you need to get rid of the laziness keeping you from temple. Think of that. What’s keeping me from going to God? Tiredness? Is it because you’re non-veg? You need to pay attention to your thoughts and karmas because that is literally what Hinduism is about. Not just Bhakti, but also liberation from samskaras and it seems you have a kind of immature view of why Hindus do what they do so you should learn more and appreciate your beautiful and blessed culture. It will make you understand the importance of vegetarianism and why temples are so important and why we do puja and wear traditional clothing and such. It’s all to lead to enlightenment right?? So if you let your tiredness stop that, then it’s like saying you’re not seeking enlightenment, just love for god. Which isn’t inherently bad, buttttt it’s not exactly fully integrated to it. Though I understand. And if someone forces you, you want to do the opposite so they love you and care but may need you to step into your own path. They just want you to be blessed and live a good life. Even if it annoys you', 'I’m not sure what to say here. You won’t go to a temple because you’re lazy?

His book mainly deals with how one can apply the concepts of law and order in daily life, personal, social and universal levels. However, the book, as is evident from its inconsistent manuscripts all over India, is not entirely the work of a single self assumed “Manu”, but rather a collective work of creative and stubborn fascists who had but a very strong vision on rule-making and science of administration.\\n\\nBefore we spit out to the Manu and the Brahmins, we must also note that Manu could not have been a single author, and he could not have been a fully racist casteist. Though Manu does appear racist fascist in designating non Aryans outside Aryavarta as barbarians, and casteist through his statements, it is to be noted that only less than 60% of the book is really authentic. And within that, there are internally inconsistent verses. So, in whole, even to this day, one can follow the Manu smrti that suits him, from the collection of verses we have today.\\n\\nSo what does it speak about?\\n\\nContrary to the popular belief, Manu smrti is not about imposing rule in lower castes, but it is a text that really traps Brahmins (which eventually forced Brahmins to manipulate it by adding escape clauses), and makes him not more than a robot, without self opinion or thought or choice of action. Having killed his opportunities and pleasures, the Manu “genersously” gives Brahmin a position highest in the society. (And does not forget to mention that Brahmins should always follow those restrictions) But yea, our later Manus who tampered with the text created verses that finally created an arrogant Brahmin caste in top with immense positions, who could not be questioned, but could dictate anything.\\n\\nManu discusses in detail about the different “Varnashramas” of different castes. The Brahmin’s part is naturally the largest, consisting of restrictions for every breath and movement. Almost four whole chapters are dedicated to restricting, controlling and immobilizing the Brahmin. Manu makes many clauses, some of them directly contradicting, but in the core, Manu wants Brahmin to be simply spiritual, above worldly pleasures, and highly orthodox. Manu, apart from prohibiting meat for Brahmins (somewhere else he also comments that one may eat meat “incidentally” as a leftover of a legitimate animal sacrifice), also prohibits a wide range of foods right from onion, garlic, mushroom… Brahmin is also prohibited to do any jobs other than his Veda teaching, learning, gifting, receiving business. And Manu also considers the following to be highly shameful jobs to a Brahmin (apart from the other “prohibited” jobs of other castes) : astrology, music, dance, doctor… Even Brahmin’s dress code is highly limited - he cannot wear beard if without proportionate hair locks, and even in such cases, the Brahmin with hair locks is not called to many functions like death anniversary feasts. His normal clothing, normal appearance, the attitude everything is predefined. Everything right from breathing (not joking), even eating posture (again, not a joke), walking, doing jobs, when to teach, when to learn, what to not do, how to not live your life, what not to eat, what not to think, what not to wear, where not to live, who should not invited for your parties and feasts, what not to desire, whom to marry, whom not to……\\n\\nNow comes the part of Kshatriya, the king. The Manu unlike the prohibition he made for all Brahmins from worldly pleasures, allows those “pleasures” to the king, but without addiction. However, Manu does create limits to the king and asks him to stay away from certain vices. The king’s laws are there in two chapters, but detailed so as to aid his rule. Personal rules are lesser. The rules of administration are well designed, though our later Manus have had a part in interpolating some “generous” verses into them.\\n\\nThe Vaishya and Shudras have rules separate, only in a single chapter, about 8 rules for Vaishyas and 2 for Shudras. Almost no personal restrictions as a part of their code, but their status much depends on the presence of other castes, the other caste determines the status of how one caste tends to behave.\\n\\nApart from all these personal restrictions to Brahmins in four long chapters (Kshatriyas have only two chaps for them, even when talking about ruling guidelines in detail), Manu supported Brahmins and Brahmanism. Manu does hint about Shramanas, and looks down upon them. The later Manus, through addition of thoughtful verses, made a Brahmin unquestionable. And, it would be silly to blame the initial Manu for all that.\\n\\nApart from the usual laws, Manu also anticipates laws during emergency periods. Here, a convenient relaxation is given in laws.\\n\\nIt is probable that initial Manu envisioned a well divided caste society with more pressure on Brahmins, who but recieved great respect, lesser pressure on King, who deserved respect from all, and almost no pressure on Shudras or Vaishyas. Castes below that have no personal restrictions - they can live their life without “offending” the other castes.\\n\\nAltogether, the Manu Smrti is a well planned, but corrupted text, just like any text post vedic age there are power games which are noticable, we know these inconsistencies come when any \\'religion\\' in power, we know this because we can observe this with Bhuddism and jainism scriptures as well, the moment they become the dominant religion of a region/s they start downplaying the \\'ahimsa\\' principal, we know that no matter the religion the priests which were patronised indulged in religious propaganda on the king\\'s behalf when their king and his ambition in regards to war and conquest grew and then they justified their \\'dharmic\\' war and their practices some of which are abbhorent, this was a practice done by every major religion in india when they were in the dominant position, this point is expanded upon in Upinder Singh\\'s book \"political violence in ancient india\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy point through all this is that given that we know there was power politics and propaganda in these smrities/shastras etc how much weightage do you place on these scriptures, they are not shruties which are the axiomatic texts of hinduism, you don\\'t buy into vedas and hinduism falls appart, that is not the case with smrities, so how much weight do you place on dhramshastras/smriti texts?? should they be read with \\'shraddha\\' and be above criticisms like vedas like manusmrities suggests or should they be subjected to scrutiniy and not be above criticisms??', 'The smriti deals with two kinds of dharma: viśesa dharma (special duties) and sāmānya dharma (common duties). The former pertains to the responsibilities allotted to the individual in the varnāśrama framework while the latter deals with the ethical and moral values that he must adopt.\\n\\nWe learn from the Gītā that varna is determined by svabhāva (nature). In the ancient past, it was possible to distinguish individual varnas by lineage alone owing to the prohibition on varna-sankara. In the modern age, where there is ambiguity regarding lineage, śīlā or character, becomes the identifying marker for varna. For it is written:-\\n\\n>**Mahābhārata Vana Parva, section CLXXIX**\\n\\n>“Men of all the four orders are without restriction constantly begetting children on women of all the varnas. And speech, cohabitation, birth and death of men of all the orders are similar in all respects. It is, on this account, that the wise have asserted that the character (śīlā) is the chief and needful thing.”\\n\\nThe injunctions of the dharmashastras regarding jurisprudence (vyavahāra), custom (ācara) and expiation (prayāschitta) cannot be applied in all circumstances for they operated on the presumption of a janma based varna system which obviously does not exist today. Thus, while the portion of the dharmaśastras pertaining to viśesa dharma is more or less defunct in this day and age, the prescribed sāmānya dharmas (such as ahimsa, āsteya, śauca) still apply.', 'The vedas are considered divine text so they are at the highest level, the other texts like smriti are not divine or authoritative, personally I think they should be ignored', 'Books for Motivation/PassionHello Everyone,\\n\\nRight now I (20M) am in a very competitive college program here in the U.S. and have worked very hard to get here, but recently I have been having a really distracted mind and unfocused on my studies.

The worse the Villain, the better the hero. This is the approach taken by many sects, **but does it mean the sects are wrong?** **No, I am not saying the Vaishnava sect or the Shaiva sect etc... are wrong,** but it\\'s not how many are portraying it to be. See, all it takes to destroy such an approach is just to prove that hero cannot be a hero without a villain. Or a king is only a king because of the people in the kingdom. If the kingdom is empty then **he is the king of what?** Another question can be asked. If the same almighty God created these non-almighty demigods, then why is the religion not written like the western religions where there is absolutely no doubt who is who and who is not? Why Vedas? Why Darshanas? Why Tantras? Why Itihasas? Any are these non-almighty gods outside the one Almighty God? Or are they within/part of the one Almighty God? If they are part of the Almighty god then that means this almighty god has parts that are non-almighty. It\\'s like saying my body has some cells that are of lesser and insignificant quality, in scientific terms, it\\'s called Cancer. So what are these sects?\\n\\nFor example, Srimad Bhagavatam is one of the pinnacle of Bhakti Puranic literature dedicated to Sri Krishna for Vaishnava. But in that, there is a chapter dedicated to Shiva in which he is addressed as Brahman. In the same Purana, Sri Vishnu calls Trimurti are essentially the same. So there was no need for a Vaishnava literature to say that. Even Prabhupad said that \"Sri Vishnu and SadaShiva are the same\" but only in one instance, but I will not go deep into them.\\n\\nNow take Devi Bhagavatam: Though it\\'s a pinnacle for Bhuvaneshwari, the highest order of sustenance is given to Sri Maha Vishnu than Shiva. They didn\\'t have to do that.\\n\\nNow go back to Itihasas: Both Shankara and Krishna are called Rudras. And Narayana says I am in the heart of Rudra and Rudra is my heart and those who make distinctions are fools.\\n\\nNow go back to great saints: TulasiDas who is a staunch devotee of Rama wrote Rama Charitramanas first gave salutations to Vani and Ganesha and also composed Rudrastakam (inhered from Ṛṣi Lomasa), why?   \\nBhartruhari a staunch devotee of Shiva said \"I do not see any fundamental difference between Shiva the Overlord of the universe, or Vishnu the Inner Soul of the universe.

It\\'s done so for the purpose of Sādhanā (a focused approach to rising in consciousness, without distractions of other schools).

I made a post identical to this one on the r/Buddhism subreddit as well, since it is also used to support the shifting belief system.\\n\\nFor those unaware, Reality Shifting (also called Shifting, quantum jumping, moving realities, etc.) is a HUGE community built around the idea that by using certain ‘methods’ you can move your subconscious to another reality and live out a totally new life, or that you can become aware of your already existing consciousness in another reality. Stereotypically it’s used by kids and teenagers to shift to Harry Potter and date the characters (specifically Draco) but it goes deeper than that, and many people use shifting as a way to live multiple lives with all of their favorite characters in their favorite shows/movies/anime/games/etc. Shifters tend to talk about ‘the multiverse theory’ (usually broadly or using the Many Worlds Interpretation) and use that to prove that shifting and all of these fictional worlds are real and that when they use their methods, they actually go there/become aware of their subconscious there.\\n\\nShifters tend to cite Hinduism and ‘ancient Hindu practices’ (with no elaboration) as proof that shifting is real and not just something that rose to popularity during the 2020 lockdowns on tiktok.

This is a very sick approach. Why? It\\'s like a movie where a Hero can only be a Hero because of the villain. The worse the Villain the better the hero. This is the approach taken by many. All it takes to destroy such an approach is just to prove that hero cannot be a hero without a villain. Or a king is only a king because of the people in the kingdom. If the kingdom is empty then he is the king of what? Another question can be asked. If the same almighty God created these non-almighty demigods, then why is the religion not written like the western religions where there is absolutely no doubt who is who and who is not? Any are these non-almighty gods outside the one Almighty God or are they within/part of? If they are part of the Almighty got then that means this almighty god has parts that are non-almighty. It\\'s like saying my body has some cells that are of a lesser and insignificant quality than the others, in scientific terms, it\\'s called Cancer.\\n\\n**2. I heard seen their preachers insulting many gods as demigods and way below the god in which they have faith, even they insult devotees of others\\' beliefs harshly calling the term \\'Mayavadi\\':** One has to read and explore the Veda composed by over 300 Vedic Rishis. None of them played this hasty game. None of the Rishis said, my homage or Vedic Suktam is better than your Suktam. Or my Vedic Divinity is better than yours. Many CULT preachers operate on Headcount, meaning, they are good at marketing, and their headcount determines the validity of their faith and teachings. As the saying goes **\"Believers go in groups, seekers go alone\"**. The three biggest things that anyone can do to destroy the Sanatana Culture are: 1. by distorting the credibility of the Guru and the magnificent beings born in this culture. 2. alter the Sanskrit text to one’s own desire. 3. create a hierarchy of Divinity and downplay them by calling them cheap names/designations.\\n\\n**What is an Authorized Sampradaya?** The fact is there were over 1008 Vedic Śākhās whose lineage goes back to the Vedic Rishis and Brahmanas. Today only 14 Śākhās exist and only 6 of these families still continue this tradition. **They are called Authentic.** **Got it!!!** Now there is the Agamic tradition that comes from Tantra. Today both Agama and Nigama are mixed like water and concrete. Only hand full of these agamic schools exists and are very secluded and hidden from popularity. Go and sit with these 6 Śākhās, spend time with them, serve them, and learn from them. Learn grammar (Vyakaranam) and get initiated. Chant and learn for 14 years. Then tell us what abides with the Vedas and what is not. People reading printed books and translations and coming to social media and throwing up their textbook knowledge, writing articles with their 2cent analysis is not worth the paper, nor the battery power of their phones/tablets and computers.\\n\\n**Does Smartha say all divinities are the same?** No, the Vedas themselves don’t say that, if so there was no need for so many divinities. Vedas explain various concepts of Rta, one cannot create a competition between them by putting them in a ring match and seeing who has more power and who wins. That only happens in Comic books and movies. Smartha operates on giving equal importance to all when homage is given but mandates one’s own kula-divam (Divinity/Rishi lineage of the family and ancestors) to be given the final importance.

The colloquial identification of the self and body is due to coordinative predication, which is called samAnyAdhikaranam in Sanskrit Grammar.\\n\\nThis means that the body is treated as a prakara or mode of the self, and during the time when they are associated together, i.e., the individual is alive, one can speak of the individual (body + soul) as one unit. \\n\\nIf the individual is named John, this name can be associated with the body without any error as long as John is alive, but technically, John is the name of the consciousness that inhabits John\\'s body.\\n\\nOnce John is dead, it would be incongrous (though still accepted in common parlance) to associate any name or label to the mortal remains.\\n\\nThus, as long as body and soul are associated, any property, name or label possessed by the soul is transferred without any error onto the associated body. This is the principle of SharirAtmabhava that was the bedrock of scriptural interpretation used by Swami Ramanuja and his followers. \\n\\nUsing this principle, they were able to provide a consistent framework for interpreting the entire body shruti vAkyAs, those that taught bhEda, those that taught abhEda, and those that taught a reconciliation or ghataka between the two. In contrast, Dvaita ( viz. Advaita) has to provide a justification at the outset why Bheda ( viz. Abheda) shrutis must necessarily be the correct ones to interpret.\\n\\nNow coming to your question, Ishwara is \"in\" the bad people in the sense that Ishwara pervades their soul the same way their soul pervades the body. The karma of the bad people affects their realisation of this fact, and in their ignorance, they literally identify themselves with their gross body. The karma only affects their body and soul, but not Ishwara. The soul is affected by experiencing the fruits of its actions in this birth and next. The body is affected by actual suffering it undergoes when associated with the soul.\\n\\nIshwara is unaffected. This is the statement of the parable of two birds in the Chandogya.\\n\\nAn important corollary of Ishwara being unaffected is that he bestows free will on the Jivatmas while being the absolute master of all. He expects Jivas to seek Him of their own free will. This also means Jivas have the potential to do evil. And this is reflective of their karma rather than His will. That this free will exists is stated clearly in the Brahma Sutras, and this disposes of the problem of Evil for the Vedantin.\\n\\nAnother important corollary is that any glory of the Jivatma is a vibhuti of Ishwara, the same way that the name John that is incorrectly assigned to the body us actually the name of the soul. Similarly, any imperfections pf the conduct of the Jivatma is a product of its karma and not Ishwara\\'s will, similar to how any physical imperfections of John do not affect his soul.', 'Although demons were created by God, their purpose is to represent the adversity to overcome on the path to Enlightenment.

The reality or truth is not held by the helms of time, space and causation, so from the perspective of reality, the transactional plane is mithya. But mithya does not mean false in the sense that it does not exist, it just means that it is an appearance, a limited manifestation in the helms of time, space and causation and is hence not the essential reality of things.

People come from all walks of life and from all kinds of circumstances, and approaching Hinduism purely from a spiritual standpoint is perfectly okay as a starting point. \\n\\nHowever, this stage gradually matures into the realisation that spirituality and religion are not enemies, and in fact, go hand in hand. \\n\\nImagine a building. The interiors of the building, all its various floors, right from the ground apartments to the terrace, correspond to sprituality. However, the interiors are supported by the external framework of the building, the most important part being the underground pillars and networks supporting the entire outer structure.\\n\\nThe underground pillars are the Vedas. The outer structure is itihasa and puranas. And the internal apartments in the building is sprituality, the essential teachings of religion. \\n\\nIt is impossible to ultimately be spiritual without being religious. You can have a building without apartments inside, but you can't have apartments inside without a building outside. Similarly, you can be religious without understanding its deeper teachings of spirituality, but you cannot be spiritual without being religious.\\n\\nMy basic point is this, spirituality is the epitome of religion, is the ultimate truth that religion is designed to impart to you. You cannot jump ahead directly to the truths of life without undergoing the necessary stages of development. The stages being the understanding of the scriptures, devotion for all forms of God, service to others. I've seen many people, especially in the philosophy I myself follow, that of advaita vedanta, claiming that they don't believe in God and that they are not religious. Hinduism doesn't need atheists in disguise.\\n\\nJust yesterday I saw a post on some spiritual subreddit which said 'I have opened my third eye, ask me anything.' I mean, are you serious? Have we reduced the chakras and other divine and extremely deep aspects of spirituality into some sort of game and a way of seeking validation and moral superiority and promoting pseudoscience?\\n\\nI have got into altercations with the orthodox religious people here too in the past who consider the words of the scriptures as words of God because of philosophical differences, but at least they were genuine to their philosophy and practice and were not hypocrites unlike the 'Spiritual but not religious people'. They simply see religion in a bad light and are too afraid to admit it.\\n\\nAgain, if you find yourself falling into this category, don't take this as an attack on you, but rather as an invitation to study religion deeply and with an open mind. If spirituality was simple and could be accessed directly, there would've been no need for religion in the first place.\\n\\n Orthodox religious systems are important and necessary, and while remaining stuck there and being attached to it due to identity politics is harmful, it is a necessary starting point. You need to walk into the building through the entrance, and can only then take the elevator to the topmost floor. You can't directly land on the terrace, it's called wishful thinking and lying to yourself. I'm talking to you, Advaita Vedanta. And yeah, I'm saying this as an Advaitin myself.

It's sensitivity.\\n\\nI was desensitized as a child, I think. Probably for good reason, this world is a harsh environment energetically speaking. Yoga and meditation initiated the process, but the deities, understanding them, interacting with their intelligence, opens channels within me that I have no idea how to do without those connections to the specific deity that provides, say, pain relief, as one deity does for me. When I chant to Her, it feels like cheating. Years of 🧘\\u200d♀️ yoga can't compete.

They might not pray to Brahman. They might not ask for favours, or tell their stories, or seek grace or forgiveness, or practice rituals to propitiate Brahman. For them, realising that they and Brahman are one and the same is the only goal of their seeking. \\n\\nPeople who match the above description might not identify as religious, because their relationship with the divine is so different from the prevalent Bhakti-inspired orthodox religious practices around them.\\n\\nThat said, those who believe in Brahman, an Absolute consciousness, are not atheists. Atheists believe that consciousness is born from matter and dies with matter - if their brain loses its physical form, they will cease to exist.

My name is Tirtha. I joined the temple a year ago and my life has completely transformed. Before coming here I was a confused young boy, who had just finished school. I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.). But by the mercy of my teachers, I was able to transform my life and become a better person. Although I have just started my path. I can confidently say that my life is meaningful and it has a deep purpose. I am happy, therefore I want to share this opportunity with others.\\n\\nBrahmacharya is a life of a monk, it\\'s a commitment to restrict oneself from sense gratification, and focus on your spiritual growth. Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek. There is a beautiful lake right next to us and breathtaking waterfalls just a few minutes away. It is a peaceful, quiet, and relaxing environment that is perfect for our spiritual practice.\\n\\nThis is exactly what we are doing in our ashram (temple). We are training young men (from 18 years old) to become strong, responsible individuals in our society. We are studying Vedic scriptures, under the guidance of our teacher Rasik Mohan Prabhu who is a lifelong monk, and who lived in a monastery in India for 16 years of his life. Every day we are practicing yoga and meditation. We also have a lot of service (seva) to do. Our project started only a year and a half ago. We have a lot of things to do and we are also open to new possibilities.\\n\\nWe are also learning many different arts and skills such as yoga, meditation, visualization, construction, painting, building, gardening, book publication, writing, singing, artistic skills, memorizing verses, studying different scriptures, public speaking, and many other things.\\n\\nSo as a resident of the monastery I am inviting every young man who is interested to come and learn how to think like a monk, and most importantly how to live like a monk.\\n\\nIf you are interested or have any questions you can write here or contact me: brotherhoodofmonks@gmail.com\\n\\nNamaste,\\n\\nTirtha', 'Am I correct in understanding that you belong to the gauDIya vaiShNava sampradAya but not to ISKCON?', 'I wish more young people would take up monkhood in a traditional way.', 'Shiva enters the world', 'Namaste, thank you for the submission.

The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis. Many of them go this way because, they cannot just simply accept what someone tells them, they need to see it, feel it, make it, experience it and realise and understand it themselves. A fervent need for intellectual stimulation. \\n\\nFor someone like this, is Bhakti yoga really viable ? are Bhakti and jnana from a broad perspective just diametrically opposite to one another?  On a simplistic level, the Bhakti yogi is less likely to question things as the jnana yogi is to accept things as is. \\n\\nAre these two things opposed to the other? What does reconciliation of these two really mean, does it mean you give up on one of the paths ? What prevents the jnana yogi from being able to surrender, is it the ego ? the notion of  \"I have to know, I have to find out\" ?

[Atharva Veda 20:129]\\xa0', 'These are claims found on Zakir Naik’s website and they have been debunked extensively in forums like Hindustackexchange.\\n\\nNow I would give Zakir Naik a thousand dollars if he can name the difference between a Samhita, a Brahmana, an Aranyaka and an Upanishad, as well the structure of each school of Vedic recension.', 'No. He is not mentioned in the Vedas whatsoever.\\n\\nI mean they’re not even prophetic texts so why would he even by mentioned', 'Lose that \"friend\".', 'First things first, this seems to be based on claims made by Dr. Zakir Naik, who no one can reasonably claim to be an expert on Hindu shastras. Second, the references mentioned in the way they are are nonsensical. It would be very difficult to find the verses he is alluding to using those references. So first it is imperative to provide the original verse in sanskrit to make any reasonable debate regarding this matter.\\n\\nNow let\\'s dive into the points laid out here. For the first two points, the same reference is given, which is not traceable using the structure of the reference given. The point asserts that the verses were mistranslated/misunderstood. With the scripture being so old, and so many commentaries having been written on it, and many debates having happened, and many interpretations having been extracted, not once have any of the great thinkers and philosophers of Hinduism made this claim of an Ahmed in that verse, or else it would be something that we would be hearing about much more.\\n\\nNow let\\'s address the third point. The reference given does not say that. The english translation by Ralph T. H. Griffith says this: \"These our libations, strength inspiring Soma draughts, gladdened thee in the fight with Vritra, Hero-Lord, What time thou slewest for the singer with trimmed grass ten thousand Vritras, thou resistless in thy might.\" And if you read the rest of that hymn, then you will realize that his understanding of the verse is a faulty abstraction due to baseless knowledge of sanskrit.\\n\\nNow let\\'s address the fourth point. The Rigveda reference given does not prophesize Muhammad. The word is Sushravas, not sushrama. Sushravas was a king, and he is the subject matter of the verse. The english translation of this reference by Ralph T. H. Griffith is as follows: \"With all-outstripping chariot-wheel, O Indra, thou far-famed, hast overthrown the twice ten Kings of men, With sixty thousand nine-and-ninety followers, who came in arms to fight with friendless Susravas.\" Here he is again putting his own definition into the word and drawing a conclusion that is way off-course.\\n\\nNow the final point. Once again we have a faulty reference in which he does not even mention the name of the purana he is referencing. Nonetheless, he is referencing the Bhavishya Puran. It\\'s important to know the structure of the Bhavishya Puran and the problems it has. Being thought of as a prophetic shastra, many people have added to it over the years to make it seem that certain things were foretold a long time ago. Wikipedia explicitly says, \"The \"prophecy\"-related third part Pratisargaparvan includes sections on Christianity, Islam, Bhakti movement, Sikhism, Sultanate history, Mughal history, British rule, and others. This part is considered by scholars as a 18th– to 19th-century creation.\" giving reference to scholarly articles. So to say that the verses mentioned are canon is nonsense.\\n\\nOne more point to make is that articles similar to this also mention that there is an Allopanishad (Allah-Upanishad). But the list of the 108 official Upanishads does not mention this and is considered to be a creation of the Mughal Era. Dayanand Saraswati does not consider it an Upanishad as it does not exist in the Atharvaveda (from which it is claimed to be, or any of the other Vedas). So that argument is baseless as well.\\n\\nSo, please fact check before believing nonsense like this. Even fact checking it a little, following the references to make sure they hold up, goes a long way, and would be helpful.

Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\\n\\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\\n\\n>tadviddhi praṇipātēna paripraśnēna sēvayā |  \\n>  \\n>upadēkṣyanti tē jñānaṁ jñāninastattvadarśinaḥ || 4.34||  \\n>  \\n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus? How do know that am not a guru?', '[deleted]', 'Very great post, and finding a Guru is one of the most valuable steps a seeker can take.\\n\\nAn important point is to not to treat acceptance of a guru casually and make a quick decision(something which happens a lot these days, sometimes followed by regrets). This is much more important than even something like marriage, and it is not considered good to leave and accept another person as Guru.  The student is usually encourage to spend some time testing and only when convinced at heart,  to commit to someone as Guru and be fully dedicated to their teachings.\\n\\nAlso, we need more guidance about sadhanas that somebody who hasnt yet found their Guru can do, how to find sadhanas which get you close to the Guru principle/tattva,  like Guru Gita, stotras to Dattatreya or Dakshinamurty,', 'Thank you for writing!', 'Indeed satsang (company of learned people) is very helpful.

Everything we do is counted in this world and karma is maintained for everyone (similar to reddit). Finally, as one's time is up we get old and dying.

And there Karna put up with Drona, for the purpose of learning arms.And that powerful youth contracted a friendship with Duryodhana. And having acquired all the four kinds of weapons from Drona, Kripa, and Rama, he became famous in the world as a mighty bowman. And after having contracted a friendship with Dhritarashtra\\'s son, he became intent on injuring the sons of Pritha\" - Mahabharata Adi Parva CCCVII. \\n\\nTruth - Then when was he rejected by Drona? \\n\\n\"Karna. one day approached Drona in private and said these words unto him, \\'I desire to be acquainted with the\\xa0Brahma\\xa0weapon, with all its\\xa0mantras\\xa0and the power of withdrawing it, for I desire to fight Arjuna......Thus addressed by him, Drona, from partiality for Phalguna, as also from his knowledge of the wickedness of Karna, said, \\'None but a Brahmana, who has duly observed all vows, should be acquainted with the\\xa0Brahma\\xa0weapon, or a Kshatriya that has practised austere penances, and no other.\\'\" - Mahabharata Santi Parva Section II\\n\\nSo he was rejected when he asked for Brahmastra. And the reason is clear - he asked it in order to fight Arjuna. He is jealous and also Drona was partial to Arjuna (and his son) so he rejects. It is then that he goes to Parasurama and lies that he is Brahmin, possibly also because Drona said only Brahmin and Kshatriya that have observed all vows can learn. We must remember that it is only Arjuna that reached the highest extent, hence proving that austerity, humbleness, service to preceptor are most important qualities to obtain higher knowledge. \\n\\n(2) Karna met Duryodhana for the first time in Rangbhoomi - The above passage answers this. He knew Duryodhana from Gurukul days itself. Moreover he was involved in the poisoning of Bhima. His enmity with Pandavas started from Gurukul days not from Rangbhoomi. \\n\\n(3) Karna tried to prevent Cheerharan - No, he was the one who started it. \\n\\n\"And at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by anger, waving his well-shaped arms, said these words,--\\'O Vikarna, many opposite and inconsistent conditions are noticeable in this assembly... Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the attire of Draupadi.\" - Mahabharata Adi Parva Section LXVII\\n\\n(4) Karna was rejected by Draupadi in Swayamvar - Actually only few editions, like 4 out of 1000, mention this. It\\'s an interpolation. Even the editions that mention that he was rejected, later when Dhrishtadyumna is wondering who can win the contest now that powerful kings have failed thinks \"Shalya and Karna both failed how can anyone else win?\", Clearly showing inconsistency. \\n\\nThe BORI critical edition , made after researching different versions, omits the part where she rejects him. Even Sri Madhvacharya boldly declared in 13th century itself that Mahabharata is interpolated heavily and then wrote Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya. Here he too writes that Karna missed the target and later Arjuna wins it - no mention of rejection of Karna by anyone. So on strength of Acharya\\'s words and also research we know it\\'s a later insertion. \\n\\n(5) Draupadi insulted Duryodhana as blind son of blind man - this is not in any edition. This is just from BR Chopra serial. \\n\\nThe Sanskrit version doesn\\'t really mention her specifically. Neither does Bhagavatam, it just says the ladies laughed. Andhra Mahabharatam and some other versions says the Pandavas laughed and then Draupadi and other ladies also laughed. But it\\'s just laughing which was quite natural, seeing everyone was doing that and it was indeed funny. It wasn\\'t mean-spirited, Duryodhana was too proud and hence he took it in wrong light. \\n\\nSerial wanted to spice up matters by adding a dialogue like that, but it maligned her character as a haughty woman. \\n\\n(6) Draupadi was a haughty woman - She is the one who forgives the killer of her sons Aswatthama and asks Pandavas to spare him, so no way. There is no instance where she is proud at all. \\n\\n(7) Ghatotkacha was a noble and virtuous person - This is because of folk tales. Indeed he did help out the Pandavas and Draupadi during their exile, and he served his father and stepmother well. \\n\\nYes Bhagavan Krishna was the only one cheerful when he died and also one reason was so that Arjuna is saved from Karna\\'s Vasava Shakti. But the other reason He mentions,\\n\\n\"If Karna had not slain him with his dart in great battle, I myself would have had to slay Bhima\\'s son Ghatotkacha. From desire of benefiting you, I did not slay him before. That Rakshasa was inimical to Brahmanas and sacrifices. Because he was a destroyer of sacrifices and of a sinful soul, therefore hath he been thus slain. O sinless one, by that act as a means, the dart given by Sakra, hath also been rendered futile. O son of Pandu, they that are destroyers of righteousness are all slayable by me. Even that is the vow made by me, for establishing righteousness. Whither the\\xa0Vedas\\xa0and truth and self-restraint and purity and righteousness and modesty and prosperity and wisdom and forgiveness are always to be met with, thither I myself always remain.\" - Mahabharata Drona Parva Section CLXXXI\\n\\n(8) Krishna is just a man in Mahabharata except for Gita, Bhagavatam made Him a God. \\n\\nThis is the most laughable myth. Because every stanza of Mahabharata describes Him as God! I\\'ll just give one but literally there are innumerous references. In Ramayana itself there are so many references to Sri Rama\\'s divinity but in Mahabharata there are many many more. \\n\\nTwo main ones. Bhishma declares this in entire Sabha of all the kings of India and front of Devas also during Rajasuya Yajna. And Markandeya Rishi who personally met Bhagavan Narayana tells Yuddhishtira about Narayana and at the end says \"The Krishna you have with you now is that same Narayana \" and instructs him to worship Him. \\n\\nEven Duryodhana knew. Dhritarashtra is told this and that no one can win over Krishna. So he gets fearful and tells Duryodhana to stop fighting but Duryodhana says that he knows all this and that he can\\'t win but that still he needs to, he can\\'t stop himself, the anger against Pandavas is too great. Then Dhritarashtra curses his fate. \\n\\nThese are it for now! Doubts about any other incidents? Let me know! \\n\\nAdditional -\\n\\n(1)  Pandavas went to hell and Duryodhana went to heaven - that is just a vision. Why would Pandavas, the close friends of Krishna, go to hell? Krishna, who is declared as \"krishnam dharmam sanatanam\"? \\n\\nThe various abodes they reached are described in Mahabharata. Arjuna reaches Vaikuntha and is shown to be sporting with Krishna there. So no Pandavas did not go to hell. The Swarga Duryodhana went to is temporary as the Gita declares, it\\'s not a permanent abode of bliss like Vaikuntha. \\n\\n(2) Shakuni was motivated by revenge - Interesting tale but no factual basis. It is not mentioned in Mahabharata, \\n\\n\"the chaste Gandhari hearing that Dhritarashtra was blind and that her parents had consented to marry her to him, from love and respect for her future husband, blindfolded her own eyes.\\n\\nSakuni, the son of Suvala, bringing unto the Kurus his sister endued with youth and beauty, formally gave her away unto Dhritarashtra. And Gandhari was received with great respect and the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp under Bhishma\\'s directions. And the heroic Sakuni, after having bestowed his sister along with many valuable robes, and having received Bhishma\\'s adorations, returned to his own city.\"\\n\\n- Mahabharata Adi Parva Section CX. \\n\\nShakuni\\'s brothers are killed in Kurukshetra by the Pandavas, so no way they all died in a dungeon. He just loved his nephew and hence supported him. \\n\\n(3) Shakuni was a master strategist and rivalled only by Krishna, he planned everything - I don\\'t recall any instance where he really did that much. I can only remember him driving the game of dice forward but otherwise it was mostly Karna and Duryodhana taking decisions. Shakuni seems to be the most moral out of the \"evil 4\" in fact. \\n\\nNeither does he seem like a master genius anywhere, he was definitely a master dice player and was smart . But  his intelligence is overblown. I don\\'t recall any super genius plan of his, and definitely Mahabharata is not just a chess game between Krishna and Shakuni like people think. He was nowhere near Krishna. \\n\\nAdmittedly I can\\'t recall other genius plans, I\\'d like to know if there is any story that shows Shakuni plotting. \\n\\n(4) Arjuna hated Karna - The rivalry was more one-sided. Karna wanted to prove himself as the best warrior and better than Arjuna. Narada Muni says that there aren\\'t warriors that can beat Arjuna and Karna implying that they are the best, hence Karna wanted to prove himself better than Arjuna and built up hatred and jealousy for that reason from schooldays itself. \\n\\nBut Arjuna did not really hate Karna. He was indifferent. He only focused on bettering his skills. When Bhima takes the vow that Arjuna shall kill Karna in Kurukshetra after Vastraharana is probably when his anger starts. Even then it\\'s not such an intense feeling from his side - he definitely is angry at Karna but the intense rivalry is more from Karna\\'s side.\\n \\n(5) Krishna is a morally gray character - No, in fact He and Vyasa Mahamuni (I would add Vidura too) are the whitest characters morally. It is known to everyone that where there is Dharma, there is Krishna and that where there is Krishna there is Dharma. Hence even the Kauravas showed respect before the war. Krishna was immensely respected and it was known that He is always, always on the side of Dharma. \\n\\nNot once did He transgress morality or the words of the scriptures, in fact when He is reviving Parikshith one of the statements He says is \"If I have never told a lie, let this child be revived\" . So definitely He never lied. \\n\\n(6) Krishna is bound by Karma, that is why He could not escape Gandhari\\'s curse - Krishna is free to do whatever He wants. Not just Him, no jnani is bound by Karma, He declares this emphatically in the Bhagavad Gita which is found in Mahabharata. Second, it is not that He can\\'t escape Gandhari\\'s curse - \"Krishna suffered it to take place although he was fully competent to baffle it. Govinda was able to alter the very course of the universe with all its mobile and immobile creatures. What need then be said of the curse of even high-souled Brahmanas? \" - Veda Vyasa Mahamuni says this in Mausala Parva Section VIII. \\n\\n\\n\\nJai Sita Rama', 'This needs to be pinned.\\n\\n\\nPlease add your insights on Duryodhan and Shakuni that you previously shared in my question a few months ago.\\n\\n\\nI recently discovered that Shakuni asks Duryodhan to stop obsessing, to which Duryodhan threatens to commit suicide (emotional blackmail) to enlist Shakuni.\\n\\nJai Shri Ram!', 'very informative. thanks.', 'Mahabharat is history of India.

I would like to add.\\n\\nWhen the laughing at duryodhana episode happens, acharya madhva writes that Krishna started laughing first, then bhima, then draupadi and everyone else. The reason was that duryodhana decided to stay back after the rajasuya yajna and then there was set up a royal council to discuss the future of the kingdom of yudhisthira. How to administer a kingdom that large and how to spread dharma. In this council all the kings, Krishna, narada and other great people were attending. *Duryodhana, who got a formal royal invitation, staggered in drunk out of his mind and late.* He also slipped and fell because he couldn't even walk properly because of the intoxication. The reason krishna laughed was to bring an end to him.\\n\\narjuna never talked about killing karna till he took part in the disrobing of draupadi. Arjuna got the various astras from Drona because he had won over the negative faculties and had conquered himself. krishna loved him because of that. Karna wanted the astras to be in the good graces of duryodhana and to be the one to kill arjuna. In fact, the sadhana of arjuna for the role had started before his being born as arjuna. The gandiva bow wielding boon, he had done tapas before and gotten it. Arjuna is indra himself with avesha of nara form of krishna.

That is 'worry' samadhi. There is no cognition of surroundings, just a blank stare. Or we might be engrossed in a book, caught up in a game, or intently watch a movie.

This isn't possible with normal objects of the world, it requires some divine support such as the ishta devata. The point is not to concentrate the mind in selfish pursuits, but rather concentrate the mind on a universal truth or symbol of the truth like Om or the ishta devata. This concentration is not like the narrow minded and focused concentration of playing a game or reading a book, but is a very broad and encompassing concentration where you are concentrating on everything at once, per se, because you're concentrating on the symbolism of consciousness itself.

Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point. Till we attain moksha which is the same as realizing that we are eternally Brahman, the normal rules of morality, human ends, meaning etc all apply. \\n\\nTo give an example, we all know that the world is made of fundamental particles of various kinds. However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels. All this everything is me etc is just a vessel to carry you to the truth and the vessel has to be abandoned one day, too. Like a boat, incredibly useful - to the other side of the river, then you abandon it and walk.\\n\\nWe use a thorn analogy, we use a thorn (advaita vedanta) to remove another thorn (human suffering) and then we discard both.\\n\\nAll this I am consciousness and everyone is me, etc etc will be refined and transformed. There is no I, consciousness is not an I. The I is the ego it\\'s ahaṃkara and consciousness is something completely different. The fact you can see the object of I-ness is proof it is not pure consciousness.\\n\\nReality is nondual, it\\'s not perceivable unless you\\'re using a mind to have transactions but the mind will limit you to a perspective of reality that is from the point of view of the mind. Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing. This disqualifies it\\'s classification of being nihilistic. Since nihilism has a \"no point\" sort of feel, and in Vedanta we believe existence is the point. Vedanta adds meaning to life, it doesn\\'t remove it.', 'What you said isn\\'t true for just Advaita Vedanta, it is true for all of Vedanta. The point that \"whatever I do is a barrier for moksha\". While it is true that the perception of \"being the only conscious being\" is not exactly the best way to word Advaita, still what you said is shared by all schools of Vedanta. \\n\\nI was going to give you a detailed answer backed up from Bhagavad Gita. But, Vashishta Muni already has answered this question when teaching Bhagavan Sri Rama. Hence it seems best that he should answer your doubt as well directly. \\n\\n[Refutation of Fatalism - Yoga Vashishta](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/yoga-vasistha-english/d/doc118039.html)\\n\\nYou can read the preceding 5 chapters to get an understanding of the basis for it if you wish. This would have the answer though. \\n\\n\\n\\nJai Sita Rama', 'Knowing that this is maya or imagined reality through anubhava is only one half of awakening. The other half is the remembrance of who you are.', 'It\\'s a beautiful question, the questioner\\'s mind has popped out of the closed box mindset, it lets me guess. Because if the question was asking for parallels between Buddhism(shoonyavad) and nihilism it would just be an ordinary philosophy class question.\\nBut the fact that the two, Advaita Vedanta and Nihilism might have some parallel, even such confusion is an insight.\\nAnd I would like to consider them one by one, so to start with Advaita Vedanta, I would like to quote a phrase from Adi Shankaracharya, \\n\"Brahman Satya Jagat Mithya, Jeevo Brahmaiv Na Parah.\"\\nThis translates to Brahman alone is real, the universe(or world) is unreal, and the individual self is no other than Brahman itself(the supreme self).\\nFor nihilism, I would like to define it as the following \"extreme scepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real existence.\"\\nSo the common thing between them is the negative value ascribed to the existence. \\nBut nihilism only ends there and has no other conclusion to draw from this fact.\\nWhile Advaita Vedanta, though says the world is unreal, but it has a conclusion, or an assertion to make regarding the reality of the individual. So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings. This is ego, made possible by mind and the senses, powered by intellect. \\n\\nThere are two ways I can describe our situation-\\n\\nA. Video game  \\nB. Dream\\n\\nIn all this \\'video game\\' we are a part of, we often forget ourselves, playing hours and hours (lives), initially remembering ourselves, but just for fun. Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives. He stabs you in the chest and you see that another person was watching impassively neither helping you nor the other guy. Now you wake up. Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan. You and the countless others before you and after you are the same, parts of dream of Vishnu. Now, you might think, why should I suffer for his Leela? He ain\\'t paying my emi nor helping me deal with office politics. But remember, in your dreams of fear and pleasure, everything was in your head, you imagined juvenile things with your latest crush or saving the world with iron man. They are not true, but your perspective in dream know it. The ego won\\'t allow that. And that leads to all the \"suffering\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>It also terrifies me to think that under all the layers of personality I think of as \"me\", there is really just a single consciousness, the same in everyone. \\n\\nWhy would \"you\" feel terrified when \"you\" in your thoughts and feelings, insecurities and securities, the physical and mental manifestation is but a dream? When \"you\" come out of the ego that there is neither \"I\" nor \"you\", there is no world but just a dream, everything in Brahman and everything from Brahman, every thought, action and feeling from him, why would \"you\" \"feel\" anything at all?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI would suggest you to read Bhagawad Gita (I read the translation by Swami Sivananda and checked any doubts in YugalSarkar website).

Bhishma, the grandfather of the Kurus, having heard this, sent messengers unto the king of Gandhara. King Suvala at first hesitated on account of the blindness of the bridegroom, but taking into consideration the blood of the Kurus, their fame and behaviour, he gave his virtuous daughter unto Dhritarashtra and the chaste Gandhari hearing that Dhritarashtra was blind and that her parents had consented to marry her to him, from love and respect for her future husband, blindfolded her own eyes.\\n\\nSakuni, the son of Suvala, bringing unto the Kurus his sister endued with youth and beauty, formally gave her away unto Dhritarashtra. And Gandhari was received with great respect and the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp under Bhishma\\'s directions. And the heroic Sakuni, after having bestowed his sister along with many valuable robes, and having received Bhishma\\'s adorations, returned to his own city. And, O thou of Bharata\\'s race, the beautiful Gandhari gratified all the Kurus by her behaviour and respectful attentions.

', \"This is a very low-level reply (mine is), and is not at all meant to be even remotely complete.  But off the top of my head, based on what you've said, the idea of Trimurti https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimurti is possibly worth looking into.  Specifically what made me think of it is that the ideas of creation/maintenance/destruction or transformation are basically considered, by many, to be essentially universal processes or principles.  Given that you're talking about mass destruction and what-not, that could potentially be understood in that light - destruction is not necessarily a bad thing, not at all, but rather a catalyst for transformation and new growth.  This is sometimes personified by Shiva and/or his consort in different forms.\\n\\nThis would likely be quite accessible to a wide audience, and would not be overly technical - see the discussion by /u/metaltemujin on what your target audience is supposed to be.\\n\\nFeel free to listen to anyone more knowledgeable than me, that just came to mind.\", \"Maybe couple of points. My perspective of Hinduism (You're allowed to have it). The whole universe is divine incl. us and all the intergalactic dust. Every atom recycles itself into something all the time in this universe. So it applies to one's soul(if you believe in soul anyway), it recycles once the carrying body is dead. So rebirth. The divine Brahman's body is all the matter in the universe and it's soul is God(conscience). Just like our body is a part of our universe, our soul is part of the collective conscience. Each soul has individuality and in order to reach God, it should have 0 net karma. These are all my own understanding and may not agree with popular theories. Also since you are talking about space, you can use the above theory that every soul reincarnate to fulfil their Dharma(which is acheive 0 karma). But if the carrier planet(Earth) is destroyed, the souls which has to be reincarnated will reincarnate in other planets with life. Intergalactic Hinduism.

He never asked for any wish or boon from Sri Krishna. When Krishna was at the verge of completing His Avatar, he called Uddhava and said,‘ Dear Uddhava, in this avatar of mine, many people have asked and received boons from me; but you never asked me anything. Why don’t you ask something now? I will give you. Let me complete this avatar with the satisfaction of doing something good for you also.’  \\n>  \\n>Even though Uddhava did not ask anything for himself, he had been observing Krishna from his childhood. He had always wondered about the apparent disconnect between Krishna’s teachings and actions, and wanted to understand the reasons for the same. He asked Krishna, ‘Lord, you taught us to live in one way, but you lived in a different way. In the drama of Mahabharat, in the role you played, in your actions, I did not understand many things. I am curious to understand the reasons for your actions. Would you fulfil my desire to know?’  \\n>  \\n>Krishna said, ‘Uddhava, what I told Arjuna during the war of Kurukshetra was Bhagavad Gita. Today, my responses to you would be known as ‘Uddhava Gita’. That is why I gave this opportunity to you. Please ask without hesitation.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava starts asking – ‘Krishna, first tell me who is a real friend?’  \\n>  \\n>Krishna says, ‘The real friend is one who comes to the help of his friend in need even without being called.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava: ‘Krishna, you were a dear friend of the Pandavas. They trusted you fully as Apadhbhandava (protector from all difficulties). Krishna, you not only know what is happening, but you know what is going to happen. You are a great gyani. Just now you gave the definition of a true, close friend. Then why did you not act as per that definition. Why did you not stop Dharmaraj (Yudhishtra) from playing the gambling game? Ok, you did not do it; why did you not turn the luck in favour of Dharmaraj, by which you would have ensured that dharma wins. You did not do that also. You could have at least saved Dharmaraj by stopping the game after he lost his wealth, country and himself. You could have released him from the punishment for gambling. Or, you could have entered the hall when he started betting his brothers. You did not do that either. At least when Duryodhana tempted Dharmaraj by offering to return everything lost if he betted Draupadi (who always brought good fortune to Pandavas), you could have intervened and with your divine power you could have made the dices roll in a way that is favorable to Dharmaraj. Instead, you intervened only when Draupadi almost lost her modesty and now you claim that you gave clothes and saved Draupadi’s modesty; how can you even claim this – after her being dragged into the hall by a man and disrobed in front of so many people, what modesty is left for a woman? What have you saved? Only when you help a person at the time of crisis, can you be called ‘Apadhbandhava’. If you did not help in the time of crisis, what is the use? Is it Dharma?’  \\n>  \\n>As Uddhava posed these questions, tears started rolling from his eyes.  \\n>  \\n>These are not the questions of Uddhava alone. All of us who have read Mahabharata have these questions. On behalf of us, Uddhava had already asked Krishna.  \\n>  \\n>Bhagavan Krishna laughed. ‘Dear Uddhava, the law of this world is: ‘only the one who has Viveka (intelligence through discrimination), wins’. While Duryodhana had Viveka, Dharmaraj lacked it. That is why Dharmaraj lost.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava was lost and confused. Krishna continues ‘While Duryodhana had lots of money and wealth to gamble, he did not know how to play the game of dice. That is why he used his Uncle Shakuni to play the game while he betted. That is Viveka. Dharmaraj also could have thought similarly and offered that I, his cousin, would play on his behalf. If Shakuni and I had played the game of dice, who do you think would have won? Can he roll the numbers I am calling or would I roll the numbers he is asking. Forget this. I can forgive the fact that he forgot to include me in the game. But, without viveka, he did another blunder. He prayed that I should not come to the hall as he did not want me to know that through ill-fate he was compelled to play this game. He tied me with his prayers and did not allow me to get into the hall; I was just outside the hall waiting for someone to call me through their prayers. Even when Bheema, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva were lost, they were only cursing Duryodhana and brooding over their fate; they forgot to call me. Even Draupadi did not call me when Dusshasan held her hair and dragged her to fulfil his brother’s order. She was also arguing in the hall, based on her own abilities. She never called me. Finally good sense prevailed; when Dusshasan started disrobing her, she gave up depending on her own strength, and started shouting ‘Hari, Hari, Abhayam Krishna, Abhayam’ and shouted for me. Only then I got an opportunity to save her modesty. I reached as soon as I was called. I saved her modesty. What is my mistake in this situation?’  \\n>  \\n>‘Wonderful explanation, Kanha, I am impressed. However, I am not deceived. Can I ask you another question’, says Uddhava. Krishna gives him the permission to proceed.  \\n>  \\n>‘Does it mean that you will come only when you are called! Will you not come on your own to help people in crisis, to establish justice?’, asks Uddhava.  \\n>  \\n>Krishna smiles, ‘Uddhava, in this life everyone’s life proceeds based on their own Karma. I don’t run it; I don’t interfere in it. I am only a ‘witness’. I stand close to you and keep observing whatever is happening. This is God’s Dharma.’  \\n>  \\n>‘Wow, very good Krishna. In that case, you will stand close to us, observe all our evil acts; as we keep committing more and more sins, you will keep watching us. You want us to commit more blunders, accumulate sins and suffer’, says Uddhava.  \\n>  \\n>Krishna says, ’Uddhava, please realise the deeper meaning of your statements. When you understand & realise that I am standing as witness next to you, how could you do anything wrong or bad. You definitely cannot do anything bad. You forget this and think that you can do things without my knowledge. That is when you get into trouble. Dharmaraj’s ignorance was that he thought he can play the game of gambling without my knowledge. If Dharmaraj had realized that I am always present with everyone in the form of ‘Sakshi’ (witness), then wouldn’t the game have finished differently?’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava was spellbound and got overwhelmed by Bhakti. He said, ‘What a deep philosophy. What a great truth! Even praying and doing pooja to God and calling Him for help are nothing but our feeling / belief. When we start believing that nothing moves without Him, how can we not feel his presence as Witness? How can we forget this and act? Throughout Bhagavad Gita, this is the philosophy Krishna imparted to Arjuna. He was the charioteer as well as guide for Arjuna, but he did not fight on his own.’ – Realize that Ultimate Sakshi/ Witnesser within & without you! And Merge in that God-Consciousness! Discover Thy Higher Self – The Pure Loveful & Blissful Supreme Consciousness! – Tat Tvam Asi!\\n\\nTL;DR; Krishna smiles, ‘Uddhava, in this life everyone’s life proceeds based on their own Karma.

In puranas we see Shiva as someone who swallows halahal poison to save the world.

I would go further on this, but not publicly. In any case, I wouldn\\'t worry. Love God, however you conceive of Her; the rest will take care of itself. :)\\n\\nEDIT: I forgot to mention something. Pope John Paul II -- an amazing guy, IMHO -- said (regarding Christians, of course) that it was possible to participate in Jesus\\' substitutionary atonement, i.e. for a Christian to suffer for another\\'s sins. Don\\'t you think that\\'s amazing? To have the opportunity to participate in the redemption of the world?\\n\\nI have read, in Hindu literature, that it is not possible to take on the karma of another person; but I think that\\'s wrong. I feel sure of it. Love breaks all the rules, and what is love but the total gift of self to another. I think that, if anything, is the defining characteristic of God: that She gives of Herself, constantly and completely. I think we were created in order for Her to have others to give Herself to. How can we not give our whole selves to others? We are all One, ultimately. Can we not suffer for others? The answer seems clear, at least to me.', 'My view is that in order for Hinduism to light you up in the skull, you have to practice it.

Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes. This then to us regular ppl appears as someone having a really really sh\\\\*tty life full of misery, suffering, etc. SO Karma indeed is the answer but there are nuances within that as well.', \"4. The creature experiencing the evil is an incarnation of God, taking on the pain for some reason that will be known later.\\n\\nExample: the Ramayana\\n\\nAlso, I don't really consider 2 or 3 to be reasons for evil to exist. They are just incidental side effects of 1: Karma.\", \"I would argue that a omnibenevelant God would do bad in the interest of good by helping us grow through suffering. As demonstrated by yin and yan, there is good in bad and bad in good. So I would extend your reincarnation point to growth within a single life, as well as over multiple life times.\\n\\nThe point of good and evil being illusionary is interesting. I understand its called illusionary as we as humans conceptualise everything and as we do our definitions are out of touch with the way things are, it's not actually saying that these things don't exist. This teaching is only calling for a deeper understanding into reality, such as, can evil be classed as inheriently bad if its nessesary for good to exist?\", \"I've never heard of this 'well known' argument. Shucks darn. Mystics don't argue.\", ',hank you for posting.', 'A DETAILED ARTICLE BY MAANOJ RAKHIT ON HINDU CASTE SYSTEM&#x200B;\\n\\n**The basics before you proceed**\\n\\nThere is something you may want to understand well before you proceed any further. If your slate/page is full you won\\'t have any place to write on it until you clean it up well. Similarly, your mind, your thoughts, your emotions —almost your whole being—is covered with a blanket. This blanket is made of primarily three components - your religion, your education system and media around you. Using (or abusing) the Media (the immensely powerful tool that it is) you are constantly being bombarded with what you *should know*. These *invisible shackles* are too demanding to let you lose. \\n\\nYou may think that you are free to form your independent opinion—almost about anything—but the truth happens to be otherwise. You are also constantly reminded that you are making an informed choice but the reality is opposite. You never realize that you are always being fed with selective information. Your religious guides tell you what they want you to know. Much the same is the case with your educators and your media. Your psyche formation —right from your childhood through adolescence to the adulthood—takes place under their guidance. And, my objective is to break that cordon of cultivated misinformation, and the resultant ignorance.\\n\\nWhen an Untruth is repeated thousand times it begins to sound like truth. When it is repeated hundreds of thousands of time it becomes The Truth, and the real truth becomes the Untruth. Your school textbooks are the best tool to achieve this fate. From the very childhood your brains are washed thoroughly leading you to a make believe world of which you have no direct experience because it relates to that Past where \"you\" were not Present!\\n\\nYour direct experiences of today (if any) are projected as the direct outcome of that remote past of which you have no true experience, except whatever you may have been told via your textbooks, your religious guides, and media stories. Guides of organized religions have their own agenda that itself guides their thought and action, and based on that they guide the thoughts and actions of their followers. Contents of educational textbooks and media coverage get widely influenced by the images that their religious guides have helped them form over generations. If there remains any question of doubt it is duly taken care of by those who control things from behind the scene, the very support system which regulates breathing of educational institutions and media outlets (that is the inflow of finances and the power centers). \\n\\nThe repetition which has carefully shaped the untruth as truth can only be neutralized by equal amount of repetition. And therefore, you must not frown upon any repetition in my works, though they are often not verbatim repetitions. You may as well enjoy reading them. 25-10-2007\\n\\n**On gross social injustice in form of caste system**\\n\\nSome of you may have read *Seed-2* and some of you may not have. I receive plenty of feedback from my readers and I know that most often people do not get on hand the first book first. They get at random one of the books from someone and start reading it. It simply does not happen that they have access to all my works so that they can read them sequentially. Hence, those who have not read *Seed-2*, for them, the following section will be helpful. And for those who may have read *Seed-2*, for them, it may serve as recapitulation. Some arguments may be common with *Seed-2* and some not—to support the same case a different logic may have been used.\\n\\n*When you think of Caste system you think of gross social injustice towards a very large section of Hindu society. And Hindu Braahman is said to be the main culprit behind this injustice. This theory has been so well propagated that people today simply find no need to apply their mind. Just like any other superstition or blind faith they believe in this theory. Whenever any such propaganda driven theory is popularized with purpose, there is always some hidden beneficiary. Who all were those—that I have discussed elsewhere—I wouldn’t want to get sidetracked here—so let us stick to the point.* \\n\\nHindu society’s foundation was based on 4-Varn System: Braahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shoodr Varn. 16th century Christian missionaries coined a new term for this: Caste system. 19th century fiercely-Christian T B Macaulay introduced Christian Missionary driven English Education System by systematically eliminating Ancient Hindu Education System in BhaaratVarsh. Christian educators slowly poisoned the minds of unsuspecting Hindu children against Braahmans. 20th century Nehru dynasty pampered Marxist-fake-Secularist educators who continued the process with greater enthusiasm. Education system, newspapers, magazines, cinema, every possible media was used. With continued repetition every one came to believe that Hindu society practiced gross social injustice in the name of Caste system. Now look at these documented testimonies that give you a totally opposite picture. These testimonies were carefully kept out of your view for long, though they existed all along! You must read them and ask yourself a question— \\n\\n*Can the foundation of Hindu society be based on gross social injustice when ‘justice and truthfulness’ has been the lifeblood of the Hindu Society through the ages?*\\n\\nMax Muller filled 37 pages with examples of Hindu Justice and Hindu love for Truth and he said that he could go on quoting many-many more. To top it he titled the chapter as *Truthful Character of the Hindus* in his book *INDIA what can it teach us?* He categorically stated (p.50): \"Now, it is quite true that during the two thousand years which precede the time of Mahmud of Gazni, BhaaratVarsh has had but (\\\\*not) few foreign visitors, and few foreign critics; *still it is extremely strange that whenever,* either in Greek, or in Chinese, or in Persian, or in Arab writings, *we meet any attempts at* describing the distinguishing features in the national character of the Indians (\\\\*Hindus), regard for truth and justice *should always be mentioned first*.\"\\n\\nHe goes on to state (p.59): \"I have left to the last of the witness who might otherwise have been suspected—I mean the Hindus themselves. The whole of their literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth.\" \\n\\n*Now tell me—do you think a society could have all along practiced gross social injustice towards its own people, a society whose whole literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth?*\\n\\nAnd why does he say \"I have left to the last of the witness who might otherwise have been suspected\"? He knew that his audience (ICS aspirants at Cambridge University in England 1882) would think these were for talk not for practice. *Therefore, he cited numerous facts based on Hindu life style and conducts before he moved to Hindu literature so that his audience realizes that the teachings of Hinduism were truly reflected in the conduct of the Hindus—and that is the real test—the speech and action must corroborate, or else, it’s fake.*\\n\\nBefore Christ was born, 5th Century, Greek physician Ktesias dedicated in his works a special chapter on Justice of the Hindus. *Hindu Justice could not have been exemplary to Greeks if Hindu social structure was truly based on a system of gross social injustice towards the vast majority of its own people.* *This is nothing but plain logic and you do not need vast degree of intelligence to understand it.* Nevertheless, let us proceed with (a) what other observers documented about the Hindu society over a period as large as two thousand and four hundred years and (b) *witness the kind of consistency those documentations reflect at.* \\n\\nBefore Christ was born, 4th Century, Greek Ambassador Megasthenes spoke of Hindu love for Truth and that no Hindu was a slave. *Now tell me, how is it that Megasthenes documented in 4th century BC that \"no Hindu was a slave\" in a society that is supposed to have practiced gross social injustice in form of infamous Caste system?* \\n\\nAfter Christ was born, 2nd Century, Greek Arrian the pupil of Epictetus said Hindus were never accused of lying. 7th Century Chinese Hiouen-thsang spoke of Hindu Straightforward Honesty and Never Unjust nature. *How is it that a society, accused of practicing gross social injustice towards its own people, has been praised by Hiouen-thsang putting it on record ‘with regard to justice, Hindus make even excessive concessions’?* \\n\\n11th Century Muslim Conqueror spoke of Hindu Justice, Good Faith, Honesty and Fidelity. *Once again, it has been said that ‘Hindus were naturally inclined to justice and never depart from it in their actions’. How could they have allowed social injustice of the kind they were accused of by Christian educators and Communist educators?* Ever wonder if they were educators by profession or professional liars? *What was their objective? Did they want Hindu children to get cut off from their mainstream religious and cultural base and begin to look for alternative with (a) Christianity in ChristianBritish days (b) with Communism/Marxism in so-called post-independence days?*\\n\\n13th Century Italian Marco Polo spoke of **Hindu Braahmans** as the most Truthful, for they would not tell a lie for anything on earth! *Now ask yourself, who have been lying all along? These people from different origins, from different centuries, who came and visited Hindus and came to invariably the same conclusion? Or, Christian missionaries who had the hidden agenda to convert Hindus into Christianity by hook or crook? Or, Communist-Marxist historians of AMU and JNU who had a hidden agenda to spread their wings so they could keep their illegitimately acquired hold over Hindu society?* All fraudsters have a brotherhood kind of feeling and they support each other. This is what these Christians and Communists had been doing but simpleton Hindus did not see through their foul play. Wake up my Hindu nation and try to understand their game plan. \\n\\nOn the other hand, only three centuries later, the Saint of Christianity named Francis Xavier of 16th century (we will soon see what other people of 16th century have to say) calls Hindu Braahmans as perverse, wicked and crafty men and terms all Hindus as unholy race (Seed-5). Such happens to be the character of a Saint of Christianity. So, you can well imagine what would be the character of the lesser ones than a Saint. *When their ulterior motives are not otherwise fulfilled, they resort to tarnishing the image of others, and in doing so they reveal their own ‘wicked and crafty nature’.* The same applies to the ChristianEnglish educated ChristianizedHindus, and CommunistMarxist thinkers who adopted such questionable methods to raise their own social status by fraudulently reducing others. And, on that premise they built their imaginary theory of so-called **Oppressive Braahmanism** so that they could discredit the Braahmans, and occupy their coveted position in the Hindu society which these characters were not worthy of. Using (rather abusing) their hold over administrative machinery and educational system, they filled Hindu children’s minds with the filth that the Braahmans practiced much despised caste system and untouchability to retain their own superiority and their hold over Hindu society. *In the process, they not only* *tarnished the image of Braahmans in Hindu society, but effectively persecuted Hinduism itself on a much wider scale.* Their motive was simple: convert the Hindus into Christians. Communists followed the lead and used the same technique. Their motive was equally simple: convert the Hindus into Communists/Marxists. \\n\\n13th Century Muslims spoke of Hindus Free of all deceit, violence and fear of death. *And, Hindu Braahmans have been accused by Christians and Communists for deceit and violence in form of gross social injustice!* The foundation on which the Christians and the Communists built their propaganda was the **imaginary** theory of Aryan Invasion (Seed-2) and establishment of so-called (imaginary) oppressive Braahmanism. *This in itself was a fraud against humanity, and deceit of high order. This crooked theory has caused immense harm to the humanity.* \\n\\n14th Century Friar Jordanus speaks of Hindus True in Speech and Eminent in Justice. *But same Hindus are accused of gross social injustice by our Christian educators and Marxist intellectuals.* Must you continue to respect these liars who committed social fraud on you? *Ask Hindus, ask yourself. Don’t you owe at least, that much to yourself?* How long do you wish to live under the spell of these crooks that taught you nothing but lie?\\n\\n15th Century Persian Ambassador spoke of Perfect Security that Merchants enjoyed in our country. *Hindu Kshatriyas fulfilled their duty not only towards their own people but also towards foreign traders and an average Hindu fulfilled his duty towards the society at large.* And, what have these crooks given you now after destroying the social fabric of Hindu society? \\n\\n16th Century Muslim Minister Abul Fazl spoke of Hindu Truthfulness, gratefulness, and unbounded Fidelity and Never flies from Battlefield type character. *This was true of every Hindu Kshatriya—when he left for the battle field his mother would tell him that \"the day has arrived for which Kshatraanis (Kshatriya women) breast fed their milk to their children and the time has come to repay that debt!\"* And, what these Christian educators have taught you all along, that, Hindus were so much divided all the time that they could not face the Muslims. Besides, lowering your self-esteem what else have they given you? Have they given you the knowledge that has benefited you, or have they cheated on you while maintaining a poker face all the while? 19th Century common Muslims spoke of Hindu Straightforwardness. Do you find any trace of straightforwardness in these Christian and Marxist educators? Why do you still continue to let them remain your educators? \\n\\nMax Muller compares legendary Hindu honesty with English and French, and finds it superior to the Europeans. He also mentioned that he can go on quoting book after book and you will find that no one ever accused Hindus of falsehood. *Think, my dear fellows, think, can the Truthfulness of this magnitude survive in a society allegedly ridden with social injustice? Or, the allegation itself has been fraudulent, and a fabrication with ulterior motive?* We will deal with those motives, in detail, in our other books. You will see from historical evidence that historical frauds have been so common with Christianity from its very inception that it has become the second nature of Christianity. 18th century Warren Hastings \\\\[India’s First Governor General 1774-1784\\\\] spoke of Hindus as Less prompted to Vengeance for Wrong Inflicted than any people on the face of the earth. This is probably the reason that Hindus continue to tolerate these fraudsters, who have perpetrated social fraud of such magnitude that they have destroyed a great civilization that lasted thousands of years until these crooks arrived on the scene. Expect me not to use better adjectives for them—they should be identified as they have been and as they are. Bishop Heber spoke of Hindus as more easily affected by kindness and attention to their wants and feelings than any people he ever met with. *This is probably the reason that Hindus respected Christianity looking at handful of honest Christians like these counted few.* \\n\\nElphinstone spoke of Hindus about their freedom from gross debauchery. *People who live a life of purity, they do not indulge into the kind of gross social injustice they have been accused of,* by Christian educators and communist educators. \\n\\nSir Thomas Munro, the eminent Governor of Madras, spoke that Hindus were not inferior to the nations of Europe and he was convinced that England had more to gain if Civilization became an article for trade between BhaaratVarsh and England. *Do you think Sir Thomas Munro would have said something like this if our Hindu society were ridden with social injustice of the kind these Christian and Marxist educators have told us, and told the world?* \\n\\nProf. Wilson spoke of better quality of Hindu Honesty at Calcutta Mint than other mints elsewhere in the world. *Do you think that the people who cannot have any social justice within their social framework can have people commonly as honest as indicated here?* \\n\\nProf. Wilson spoke of **Braahman Simplicity truly Childish**. *Do you think that these Braahmans could have been credited with such childish simplicity if they happened to be such dirty people, who were alleged to have created this treacherous caste system for their own benefit?* Look at the statement (see *Seed-5 Christianity in a different Light—Face behind the Mask*) of St. Xavier, which painted Braahmans as perverse and wicked. Look at his reason, which he himself described to the Society of Jesus. *Xavier could not convert many Hindus into Christianity. His ulterior motive was hurt. So, he painted Braahmans in such bad light. His successors did the same thing. Later day missionary educated Hindus parroted what their teachers had taught them. Realize that you have learned the falsehood from your Christian educators and you have spread that falsehood further through television serials, movies, newspapers, etc. Now you must stop and reverse that process, which you too are responsible to some extent but only as the pawns in the hands of those master conspirators, who fooled you and cheated you all along.* If anyone is to be despised, it is not **Braahmans** but these cheats called Christian educators and Communist-Marxist educators.\\n\\nColonel Sleeman has put on record that he had before him hundreds of cases, in which a man’s property, liberty, and life depended upon his telling a lie, and he refused to tell it. Max Muller then asks: Can many an English judge say the same? *Could our so-called wretched caste system and a socially unjust society have produced such truthful Hindus incomparable elsewhere?* Do you realize the significance of this sentence: Can many an English judge say the same? *By deductive logic, if the outcome was so great, then the foundation also had to be equally great. And, that foundation was the 4-Varn System.* People with vested interest speak against it. People of ignorance keep parroting the same. Today, if we do not see any trace of such legendary truthfulness amongst Hindus, it is because these Hindus have become Christianized-Hindus, under the very bad influence of six generation of English-Christian Education System, which Macaulay instituted as he wanted to Christianize the Hindus. \\n\\nMax Muller says that for past two thousand years Greeks, Chinese, Persian, Arabs, all described the most distinguishing feature of Hindu society as its regard for truth and justice, *but for two hundred years English-Christian education system taught Hindus that the most distinguishing feature of Hindu society was its social injustice in form of 4-Varn System, which they renamed as caste system.* Were these Christian educationists lying all along? *Was their lie part of a much bigger conspiracy against Hindu society? Was it to bleed Hindu society to death?* \\n\\nEnglish Merchants spoke that commercial Honor stood higher in India (BhaaratVarsh) than in any other country. Why we do not see any evidence of it today? *Is it because Christian educators have completely ruined the sense of ethics amongst Hindus? Educators, who themselves posses no ethics, what else can they pass on to their pupil?* *If they themselves were not truthful, then how could you expect to learn anything about justice from them?* \\n\\nYou must understand this basic fact: *if the foundation is* *based on fraud, its outcome will also be fraud. In this context, English-Christian education system’s foundation was based on fraud against Hindu society. Their purpose was ignoble. Their intentions were conspiratorial. There was simply no regard for truth and justice in their belief system. Therefore, they produced crops like themselves. Students of their education system, through next six generations, gradually continued to become fraudulent like their teachers. They lost regard for truth and justice that happened to be cherished Ethos of Hindu society until two centuries ago!* \\n\\nMax Muller wrote the whole of Hindu literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth. He expressed doubt whether in any other of the ancient literatures of the world you will find traces of that extreme sensitiveness of conscience which despairs of our ever speaking the truth. *Now, ask yourself a question. Here stood Hindu society which practiced truth and justice by thought, speech and action for thousands of years, and with consistency. Could there have existed, unnoticed by all concerned, the gross social injustice of such magnitude in form of the infamous caste system? Was it the brainchild of those conspirators, who converted into reality of today, something that was nonexistent in the days of which they spoke of?* \\n\\nMax Muller writes, Hindus may teach us at least one lesson of truthfulness, that is, truthfulness to ourselves. *What did Christian educators do? Instead of learning that truthfulness from Hindus, they destroyed the truthfulness of Hindus.* This is what you acquire from an Aasuric religion like Christianity. They have destroyed your sense of ethics, justice, truthfulness all that you ever valued. \\n\\n*If it was all so good for 24 centuries continuously, as documented in the testimonies of non-Hindu visitors to this Hindu land, then what went wrong in less than two centuries? The answer is simple. Keeping all factors constant, the only variable on the scene is the presence of Aasuric influence of Christianity, which has eclipsed the Hindu society.* \\n\\n**Braahmans were the poorest of all**\\n\\n*It generally takes longer to build than to dismantle! Not for centuries, but for millenniums,* ***Braahmans*** *played the exemplary role. They themselves lived as the poorest of the lot but raised rich morals among the rest in the society. And, ample evidence of such rich morals, as documented by many-many foreign visitors to this Hindu land over more than two millenniums, you have already seen.* Do you remember the legendry poor *Dronaachaarya* who could not buy milk for his only child *Ashwatthaama*? Do you remember poor *Sudaama* who could only carry few grams when he went to meet his childhood friend Shri Krishn? Do you remember the stories that you read during your childhood? Whenever the central figure of the story happened to be a Braahman, did those stories not begin as \"Once upon a time there was a poor Braahman\"? Can you remember any story \"Once upon a time there was a rich Braahman\"? Well, I would not be surprised if you manage to find me one of them created during past fifty odd years by one of those MarxistCommunist intellectual professors of JNU who have mastered the technique of fabricating history in connivance with their bedfellow AMU professors. You will find enough evidence of such historical fabrications in *Seed-1.*\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nNow I invite you to take a special note of the fact that all the testimonies that I have presented before, are \\n\\n• Not by people who had a specific mission \\n\\n• Not by people who subscribed to a single ideology \\n\\n• Not by people who were part of a single theology \\n\\n• Not by people who were in any way connected with each other by an invisible thread \\n\\n• Not by people who had any reason to carry any special leaning in favor of the Hindus \\n\\n• Not by people who could be accused by any stretch of imagination that they were working together towards building a specific image for the Hindus. What does this all convey to you?\\n\\nThe extraordinary character and integrity of Hindu society was incomparable in the recorded history of mankind, and therefore, I see no reason whatsoever to be defensive about our ancient 4-Varn System and try to explain it away apologetically in the manner many modern interpreters tend to do. *It is their own low self-esteem that makes them do so. Their knowledge is of no use if they cannot see through the game plan of those conspirators who have brought their self-esteem to this low level.* \\n\\n*It is our 4-Varn System that prevented extinction of Hindu society under thousand years of barbaric Islam invasion, whereas* financially supported (by Hindus) one-class (monk based) Buddhist society was totally wiped out from BhaaratVarsh on account of the same Islamic invasion. \\n\\nHindu Society that was known for its regard for Justice over two thousand years \\\\[5th Century BC-AD 19th Century\\\\]. *Such society could not have been practicing gross social injustice within its own framework. This is nothing but plain and simple logic!* \\n\\n**A message to the Braahmans** \\n\\nI am not a Braahman by birth. I have no personal interest in defending you. I am on the side of Dharm. And Dharm is always on the side of Truth.\\n\\nI won\\'t fight your battle today. You have to do that. I will only hand you the ammunition needed for you to fight that battle of Truth. Let knowledge be your \"Bow\" and arguments be your \"Arrows\". This is what I offer you!\\n\\nBraahmans! Realize your strengths. You have given birth to Dronaachaarya, and he had raised an Arjun.

I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house. I have come to Hinduism after a long exploration of other religions since my teens. ', \"Hinduism is difficult to understand in few short paras or even book. For example, many hindus will refute your claim about it being polytheistic, stating all those gods/demi-gods etc are just manifestation of one power which is formless and attribute-less (some hindus will claim one god but with attribute and form instead).

Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred.

Or also in my case as a way to think about how fast exponential growth is (I am a math teacher)\\n\\nIt goes something like this:\\n\\nWhen the game of chess was invented in ancient India it became extremely popular through out the country.  In particular there was a king that was especially fond of the game and quite good at it.  He was so confident in his abilities he made a challenge to his subjects that if someone could beat him at the game he would grant them any prize that was in his power to give.\\n\\nMany people attempted to beat the king but all failed, until eventually a timid man came forward to take the challenge and actually ended up winning the game.\\n\\nThe king being very impressed with the man\\'s skill asked what the man would like for his prize and the man responded:\\n\\nWhat I want is this: on the first square of the chess board place one grain of rice, on the second square of the chess board place two grains of rice, on the third square of the chessboard place four grains of rice and so on doubling the amount of rice on each square until you get to the end.\\n\\nThe king laughed at the seemingly humble request and called to his assistant to fetch a bag of rice from the store room.\\n\\nHowever the Kings accountants quickly realized that the mans request was far from humble, because if we went on continuing to double the number of rice on each square by the time we got to the 64th square there would be 2^63 grains of rice, or 9,220,000,000,000,000,000  or 9.2 Quintilian grains.  Which is more rice then the entire planet could produce in a thousand years.\\n\\nWhen the king realized the blunder he made by accepting to give this to the man, the man revealed himself to be the Hindu god Krishna (If I remember correctly, I could be wrong about their name)  and Krishna told the king that he did not expect payment right away and could be paid over time.  And so to this day people still offer rice to the god as penance for the arrogance that he displayed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain I just like this story because it illustrates exponential growth and the idea of \"look before you leap\"  But I wanted to know if this story was actually part of Hindu tradition, if it was actually Krishna or a different god,  and if it is not a part of Hindu cannon is it offensive to tell the story this way?  Because I think it is kind of like poetic justice to have it end that way.\\n\\n\\nAny thoughts or comments are welcome, thanks!', 'Yes it is a part of Hinduism. The temple \"Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple\" was built based on this action of Sri Krishna.

Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\n--------\\n\\nThis is a tough question to answer.  The only way I can explain it requires a bit of a philosophical paradigm shift, which is to say I embrace a somewhat Yoga-esque, \"endeavor to enjoy experience without the desire for result\" standpoint.  But that\\'s not an easy answer to accept.\\n\\nI\\'m still researching Dzogchen Buddhism, which seems to closely align with this idea of a dream-like \"un-reality,\" but I\\'m not having much luck so far.\\n\\n---------\\n\\nSo my question (at long last) is this: how can I best explain to someone that an illusory reality, a \"lie,\" is worth taking seriously?  What is the \"point\" of doing anything if reality is really just a dream?', '> \"What is the point,\" they ask, \"if everything is just a dream? Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\nIt makes me wonder:\\n\\nWhat does one gain if it is not a dream, if it is not an illusion? If something is \"just\" a dream, this implies that there is some sort of reality to which \"just\" cannot be applied. What is that? When you scrape this real world, what comes off in your hand? It\\'s more than experiences, so what is it? What is left over that makes this real world more real than the illusory world?\\n\\nIf the problem with the illusory world is that it doesn\\'t have a point, the real one must. What is that, and how does it differ from a set of experiences?', \"One answer is that it will still feel real to you. If a Godhead is dreaming it or not doesn't really change the reality of pain/sorrow/enjoyment. You cannot get out of our reality by thinking yourself out of it, there are specific processes to get out of it, that would be the spiritual processes of yoga.\", 'This is why one does not learn philosophy from video games. Can you explain in any clear terms what the statement \"A dream in the mind of the Godhead\" even means and why we should think that this is what is the case?\\n\\nI am not aware of a single Hindu school that says we are a dream in the mind of a Godhead. And this is why you\\'re not having any luck, it\\'s a nonexistent position only found in new age books and video games. ', \"Krishna Consciousness What is Paradise? Would it be some kind of situation in which every desire is satisfied? That would be a hollow kind of joy, and anyway, there would always be some unavoidable conflict with others wanting different things. Actually to want some kind of immortality as an individual ego is something very shallow, true joy begins where false ego ends.\\n\\nSo a more sophisticated explanation is something like “Nirvana” as it is described by certain Buddhist schools, the complete destruction and dissolution of all ego. It is clear that false ego is the primary cause of suffering, with all of the subconscious games it plays keeping us caught up in empty fascination. Hence the contemplative techniques, meditative techniques, found in all serious forms of religion, which are designed to help us see through our own selves, to look within and see the face beyond the masks. *“Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes”*, said Carl Jung.\\n\\nYet there is something unsatisfying about this. Ego-Death is a kind of death after all. There is something fundamental to humanity, the desire to live, something about the experience of being human which makes us wary of annihilation, even if it be a form of peace beyond that of individual existence. There is a natural desire to live, to be a human being, even if *“life is suffering”* as Buddha taught. This instinct often leads us away from religion, into the life of the senses and worldly pursuits for gain, but it can also lead us to a more holistic, more total, conception of a Paradise.\\n\\nKrishna Consciousness begins with the notion that we are all originally servants of God, whose qualities are encapsulated and present in the name KRISHNA. To be liberated from suffering is to return to our original position as servants of God, rather than as servants of the senses and of our desires. As God is in every way perfect, serving God is therefore the highest form of bliss any soul can attain.  \\n\\nUntil we turn away from the material life and engage in the Devotional Service of Krishna, again and again we are cast into physical bodies in order to satisfy particular desires and in accordance with the results of our previous actions. Just as the body changes from youth to old age but the soul remains the same, so do we change bodies but remain the same spiritual spark of consciousness. Returning to our original position, seeking to again become servants of Krishna, is the way to freedom from this cycle of Death and Rebirth known as Samsara. Thus it is taught that through Devotional Service we will attain rebirth on one of the spiritual planets collectively known as Vaikuntha and continue forever serving Krishna in His presence.\\n\\nThis whole conception quite nicely synthesises the other two conceptions of Paradise as Eternal Bliss or Ego Annihilation. What’s more, Krishna Conscious philosophy also includes in itself these other forms of Liberation or Paradise, which it considers to be partial and temporary. The worshippers of Demigods after the death of this body go to different planets where fulfilling the desires of the senses is very easy, before eventually returning to earthly realms. The “Mayavadis” and Buddhists who seek Ego-Annihilation are dissolved in the light emanating from Krishna, also eventually redescending into material creation.\\n\\nWhat we must understand is that Krishna is not an abstract concept or some incomprehensible effulgence. He is a personality (Vigraha) possessing all opulences. Sat-Chit-Ananda; Eternity, Bliss, and Knowledge. He is the Supreme Personality, qualitatively the same as us but quantitatively superior.  We must understand that Eternal Joy is found in no longer serving the Ego but serving Krishna instead. Everyone must serve something, be it some sectarian religion, their country, their family etc., but the intelligent person takes to serving Godhead. After all, God is the source of all things, the source of all happiness. We simply must accept that we are not and shall never be God, nor shall we find any permanent joy outside of serving Him.  \\n\\nThis Yoga of Devotional Service, is known by the Sanskrit name of BHAKTI YOGA.\\n\\nVarious simple rules were put into place by Prabhupada, the founder of the Krishna Consciousness movement in the West, for those wishing to practise Bhakti Yoga. There are four Regulative Principles: 1) No Meat Eating 2) No Gambling 3) No Intoxicants 4) No Illicit Sex, which devotees of Krishna should strive to conform to. In general we must avoid those things which keep us bound up with material nature, identified with the material body rather than the spiritual soul.  \\n\\nFood should be offered to Krishna before being consumed in order to free us from the Karmic effects of it’s production. We should not eat meat, fish and eggs along with onions and garlic are also prohibited. To kill, even an animal, is against the laws of nature, and cow protection is a central pillar of Krishna Consciousness – after all, the cow is like our mother, giving us milk. In general asceticism proves useful in returning back to the spiritual planets, back to Godhead, but we should not be extreme:\\n\\n“*There is no possibility of one's becoming a yogi, O Arjuna, if one eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.” (Bhagavad Gita As It Is 6:16).*\\n\\nNonetheless it is quite possible to seek to serve Krishna even if we haven’t mastered the Regulative Principles, any efforts will bear fruit. Most importantly, and before everything else, it is necessary to chant the MAHA MANTRA:\\n\\nHARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE  \\n HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE\\n\\nThis Mantra, the Holy Name, is not quite like many forms of prayer. We are not asking for anything except to be the servant of Krishna always, there is no question of wanting money or material exaltation. The chanting of the Mantra is compared to a child crying for its mother. It contains all the potencies of Godhead in its transcendental sound vibration. People remark that it is not tiring to chant this mantra as some other mantras can become. Devotees in these times try to chant a minimum of sixteen japa (16 x 108) of this mantra each day, though in the past saints have chanted many more and a few still do today.\\n\\nThe chanting of Holy Name was widely popularized by the last Avatar of Krishna, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, in the 15th and 16th century. He was the “Yuga Avatar” of Krishna, giving the appropriate teaching for the present age. We are currently in what is known as Kali Yuga, the dark age of the cycle of four ages. In this age human life is shorter, there is more suffering, little spirituality or charity and many other negative symptoms. However on the positive side it gives us the opportunity to return to Godhead through the simple process of chanting Hare Krishna. Furthermore it is predicted that humanity will experience a ten-thousand year golden age within Kali Yuga, a time when the chanting of Maha Mantra will be widespread.\\n\\nWe can abandon all other processes and simply surrender to Krishna. There is no need for any extraneous and sectarian practises beyond this: *“If you pour water on the root of the tree, the water reaches to the branches, to the twigs, to the leaves, to the flowers, to the fruits automatically”*. God has many names, there are many ways of approaching Him, but the chanting of HARE KRISHNA is the most suitable process for these times. The motto of Krishna Consciousness is:\\n\\n“SIMPLE LIVING, HIGH THINKING”\", 'There are 2 paths...one of moksha which is ultimate death and then there is of bhakti- to be near your prabhu and enjoy only the good parts of existence( encapsulated by Narad Bhakti Sutra).

Like a drop of water on lotus leaf, the drop is attached to the leaf yet is detached.   \\n\\n\\nIt is said that there are different levels of permanence of pleasure & pain that comes from any attachment. Some pleasures & pains pass quickly, some linger longer. But, none of them are really permanent. If the pleasure & pain is not really permanent, if it waxes & wanes depending on age, circumstance, availability of other pleasures, then the object of these emotions is not an ideal permanent attachment to the soul either.   \\n\\n\\nI think it is inevitable to get attached, but we need to realize it will all pass & is not really a permanent attachment to your soul.   \\n\\n\\nIt is like playing a game of chess.

The usual objection to this is social or an attitude one internalizes from education - society praises selfless actions and looks down upon selfish actions. Now, this can be a good thing in many situations(helping people become more happy, avoid conflicts) or maybe not in a few situations. But the important point is that this surface criticism is not the main thing.\\n\\nIn contrast, consider this change - someone likes eating a lot, but runs into health problems, then does some kind of fast say one day a week, actually feels better than even when he was eating a lot, both for health reasons and also due to a development of a certain vairagya(non attachment) which is experienced as a kind of a freedom.\\n\\nDharma teachings say that the root of this process depends on one's understanding of self - for instance, in the giving up of a book, or a more intense example leaving a house after staying for many years, there is an experience of losing part of self, which points to an implicit model of self we are holding internally.  \\n\\nJust noticing this self constantly, like a painter looks at a landscape, without even doing any renunciation, is a kind of meditation, - constantly wanting to expand itself by getting objects or winning social approval, or feeling good when achieving something. The word 'Brahman' etymologically comes from 'to expand', so this desire is not condemned in a basic sense, although identifying the self with the body or social narrative about oneself is seen as the confusion which cause pain.\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita's first 6 chapters are about renunciation of fruits of action(not actions themselves) - but when they describe the resulting state - the yogi sees their own self and the Parmatma in all beings. Or to take a more common example, a parent usually doesnt feel bad when an object like a book or a house is taken by their child,  **as the child is seen as a continuation of the self**.\\n\", \"Why I think Hinduism has one of the most enlightened approaches to realization of reality - the problem of solipsism.This post will be based upon this realization that has changed my whole view of the world : **That the resolution to the crisis of solipsism is fundamental unity in all creation, which is parallel to certain notions of “God”.**\\n\\nLet me explain. This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe). It is more like Kashmir Shaivism and other similar traditions.\", \"Advaita Vedanta is a beautifully rich tradition, but I fear it often becomes the most popular choice for people (often westerners) who are simply shopping around for interesting philosophies. \\n\\nRemember to ground your understanding in some sort of real practice or Sadhana, otherwise it's just intellectual gymnastics. \", '[deleted]', \">you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ‘you’ stay in this material world and utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' (the impeccably designed video game).

Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality\\n\\nSo literally doing anything at all goes against non-duality? In which case, Shankara who wrote volumes of literature and spent his entire life debating people would also be pretty non-advaitic. You sound like some edgy nihilist who just discovered buddhism.\\n\\n\\nThe brahman maybe formless but it's not some dead and static inertia where literally nothing happens. In kashmiri shaivism, the idea of constant internal movement - spanda - is the defining characteristic of the highest non-dual reality, as it is of the grossest reality.\", \"Where does the term Sanatana Dharma come from? Do all Hindu traditions actually place importance on the Vedas?I always heard how the word Hinduism is actually a word of foreign origin and is not the real name of the religion, but the real name is Sanatana Dharma in which the different traditions have their basis in their Vedas. How much truth is there in this claim, and where does the term come from?\\n\\nI haven't read Balagangadhara's work that in-depth yet, so I probably have a few things wrong, but what I've read so far is that the concept of Hinduism itself is a colonial construct that was created by the British, and that the concept of Hindu traditions being united by following the Vedas is something that came later so that Hinduism could be a real religion and fit somewhat of an Abrahamic framework. Basically, Abrahamic religions are the only religions, while other forms of practices are traditions.\\n\\nDo all traditions that are classified as Hindu actually value the Vedas, even if it's just lip-service? If not, then what is the basis of the term Sanatana Dharma? Was the concept of Sanatana Dharma actually a thing or was it just an attempt to create a Sanskrit term for Hinduism?\\n\\nThere's a lot of rambling here, so hopefully this makes some sense.\", \"Hinduism did not evolve as a single religion or identity, so no matter what you call it, it will be whimsical. That said, it is a good idea to call ourselves Hindu because it affords a social and political and even economic classification that can be helpful to keep traditions alive and make sure people aren't being preyed on.\", \"To understand what Balu is saying, one first needs to be clear about two themes in discussions - One, we are not talking about the names whichever one you use.(At best, a name can give a hint some shared concept exists, but words can also cause confusion, we can be divided by a common terms with different meanings). Two, he is not saying that 'Hinduism was constructed in the 19th century'. This has been said by a lot of postmodernists etc. \\n\\nInstead the issue is something like this - imagine you have two board games with very different rules and players of board game 1 see board game 2 and because of surface similarities, try to understand it as a variant of game 1. So things which are not seen by game 2 players are seen by game 1 players and some of the basic themes which actually do exist in game 2 are missed.\\n\\nWhat about the game 2 players? Because of the language issue and need to fit into laws designed by game 1 players, another thing happens - either game 1 words are understood by game 2 players in terms of their own concepts while being unaware of their original meaning(ie Indians dont understand western ideas even when using western words for previously existing concepts, ex: 'religion' is understood as dharma), or alternatively, game 2 players lose access to their own previous understanding(unlike the former case, they might actually understand dharma as religion) due to growing up in a new educational environment and game 2 just seems strange and incomprehensible(game 1 rules dont really work for understanding game 2) - why would anyone play it?\\n\\nSo, this is not a question of definition. Imagine, if alien anthropologists discover the chess board game along with extensive records of games. One can easily just go around defining 'chess' in terms of surface features like white pieces and black pieces, the shapes of pieces, 'we have discovered a lot of diversity - in this part of the world, the knight piece  looks different' without developing any understanding. They need to develop a theory of what is going on and test it against extensive record of annotated games.(Slowly discovering piece moves, exceptional things like en passant, when the game ends and so on)\", \"Some Yoga traditions are slient. But they don't go and condemn the Veda either.\\n\\nWell,sanātana dharma is a neologism,but that is not an illegitimate one. Neither is Hindu an illegitimate term.\", 'Your question has three layers. 1. What is religion. 2. Since when Hindus started considering themselves as distinct religious community 3 Usefulness of  definition based on Vedic scriptures. \\n\\n1\\n>  Basically, Abrahamic religions are the only religions, while other forms of practices are traditions.\\n\\nThat would depend on definition of term religion itself right?  Definition of religion has evolved amongst anthropologists in last couple of centuries from definition which was very narrow,  applied to only organised sects. At that time catholicism and various branches of protestants like Lutherans, calvinism, anglicanism were considered separate religions and concept of religious freedom and separation of state and religion etc evolved even though everyone was Christian at that time. Now definition has broadened to something like \\n\\n> Religion is any cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, world views, texts, sanctified places, ethics, or organizations, that relate humanity to the supernatural or transcendental.\\n\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion  It is important to use broad definition of religion and consider Hinduism, Chinese traditional religion, shintoism etc as religions because special legal and social status modern society accords to \"religions\" as opposed to non religious ideologies. Eg Legal sanctions against discrimination based on religion etc. Social sanctions against persecution of someone because of his religion. For example it is socially acceptable to say \"punch a nazi\". It is socially acceptable or even socially required to fire someone for being a nazi even if that person has done no crime ever, participated in no violence and has done nothing more than hold some flag in some rally. While same society takes pains to constantly remind everyone #NotAllMuslims even though Muslim texts contain intolerant statements about Jews and infidels and there are instances of large scale violence by Muslims throughout history. \\n\\n2\\nStart of thinking of Hindus as one religious community definitely precedes British.  You have saints like Kabir preaching unity of \"Hindus and mussalman\". Sikh gurus saying be neither Hindu nor mussalman. These statements etc only make sense if popular conception at that time thought of Hindus and Muslims as two distinct religious communities. Shivaji founding hindavi swarajya,  maratha polity writing letters which show anger at tipu sultan\\'s forced conversion of Hindus in faraway kerala region etc also suggest pan Hindu communal identity in opposition to mussalaman was already in place. Without opposition to Muslims also we see one text describing Hindu as \"worshipper of narayana etc devatas\" . In pre-Islamic times we see division between astika traditions and nastika traditions in philosophical discussions though for ordinary people that division probably wasn\\'t much important. \\n\\n3\\nReason for defining Hindu using \"vedic scriptures\"  (which include scriptures other than Vedas  which accept authority of vedas) is simply practical. All extant non vedic nastika traditions that is Buddhism, jainism and Sikhism have rejected label Hindu. While all other astika organised traditions who accept authority of Vedas call themselves hindu. That leaves lingayats and masses of people who call themselves Hindus but may never have heard of Vedas. While hindu-ness of lingayats is controversial issue. Most of common Hindus who don\\'t belong to any officially vedic sampradaya have beliefs and practices extremely similar to those described in vedic scriptures. It is simply practical to define Hindus using vedic scriptures while being mindful of spectrum of scriptural to folk Hinduism.

'God of universe' vs 'God of man' .If we were to hit a rod onto the surface of a flowing stream, the undivided flow of water seems momentarily divided into two streams. In the evening sky, the moment the first star appears and twinkles, the otherwise unending sky appears to have acquired a point of reference, quadrisected into four cardinal directions.\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0This material world too, in all its eternity, gets divided into two parts as soon as the star of human awareness starts twinkling.\\xa0 Dichotomies like the beautiful and the ugly, the fragrant and the malodorous, the melodious and the harsh to hear, the soft and the hard, the dear and the unpleasant, the good and the bad, the divine and the evil, and others emerge as soon as human need becomes the point of reference in this cosmos. All that humankind considers good, pleasant and helpful is one part of this world while all that is unpleasant, all that unfavorably or adversely affects human existence is the other part of this world. He who creates the good part is “God” while he who creates the bad part is the “Rakshas”, “Asura”, “Satan” or “Devil”. Accepting these elementary human sensibilities as the working criterion for understanding the usefulness, goodness or badness of the cosmos is quite unavoidable.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Our ancestors realised ages ago that it was impossible to count, analyse, characterize and qualify or quantify each and every living species and non-living entity of this immeasurable and unfathomable universe. Instinctively they chose to analyse the things and beings in the universe using the five senses humankind is gifted with- touch, sight, scent, hearing and taste. Now everything had one or more attributes one could, well, “sense”. For example, the rose was red by color, soft to touch and fragrant by scent. While a fruit was sweet or sour by taste, aromatic by scent, cool and wet to touch, with a certain appearance for the eyes. A cuckoo was black to see and sweet to hear. A breeze was cool or warm to feel (to “touch”) while a sea storm was frightening to hear, forceful to feel and salty to smell. Given the primitive times then, this very idea of using the five senses was a veritable leap of human ingenuity! They developed this thought process to call the five senses representatives of the Pancha Maha Bhootas (The Five Great Elements), namely Pruthvi (Earth or the solid state of matter), Aap (Water or the liquid state of matter), Tej (Fire, light energy or radiations), Vaayu (Wind, air or gaseous state of matter) and Aakash (Outer space, vacuum or the Great Void). Spiritually, they theologized that whatever conversation or dialogue we humans could have with the God of this universe was also through these five senses, hence they even developed the concept of the five-headed deities, like Pancha Mukhi Mahadev, Pancha Mukhi Hanuman or Pancha Mukhi Ganesha.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Just as the process of studying the universe and its objects and beings with our five senses was so natural and instinctive, so were the attempts at trying to figure out if there indeed was any psyche behind the very forces who could create this universe. These forces were deified and became objects of faith across ancient cultures. The thought that came forward was that by creating this bounty and abundance of natural wealth for human prosperity, Nature was indeed very kind-hearted and affectionate like a mother who provided for her children, us human beings. Nature was\\xa0Mother\\xa0Nature,\\xa0Mother\\xa0Earth,\\xa0Mother\\xa0Life, the Goddess “Srushti” or “Prakruti”, who tended to us her children. By psyche she was all that a mother could be- affectionate, loving and providing. This “faith” has only been reinforced from time to time by the gifts Mother Nature has been showering onto us from time and again onto humankind till today! Likewise the Creator was Father Creator, the powerful “Purusha”, who though so powerful was yet, by psyche, so kind, gentle, caring and compassionate that He laid the very seed of human existence and a habitat to sustain human life!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Truly, for the benefit, utility and happiness of humankind, the compassionate God has created nature with such meticulous paternal love! This sun, this ocean, how majestically big these Great Elements! But the kind God employed even them for the service of humankind. Just as a mother would keep cool sweet water filled up for her kids coming home from their play out in the afternoon sun, so does the “Sun-God”, using sunrays as suction conduits, suck up only the water sans the salt from the salty oceans thereby sparing the sweet water of the rivers – and then store up this distillate in heavenly reservoirs, making it tempting even to the Gods! Just imagine the control mechanism over this saltwater-to-Sweetwater conversion – only as much capacity is there in the sunrays for this conversion as is the water required in one year and only as much is the water storage capacity of the celestial reservoirs- the clouds. At the same time, the oceans are themselves not turned sweet, sparing our whole life from becoming tastelessly bland!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Look at the animals! They are of various calibers of intelligence and various specializations, as varied as the varieties of services humankind expected of them in the pre-industrial ages! The Gods taught the camels the art of eating desert thorns and going without water for days, adapting them to life in a desert habitat – and they became the ship of the desert, a lifeline for sustaining human life in the inhospitable harsh desert! And how swift is the horse! God has given him strength and forbearance to both gallop for hours and to manoevour in the midst of a pitched battle all the time balancing and bearing the weight of a human rider for hours. There are many examples of steadfast loyalty where horses have even sacrificed their life for their masters, like the horse Chetak who carried Rana Pratap to safety before dying of exhaustion. Yet God has not over endowed the horse with the intelligence to ride a human being instead. Take the dairy cow or buffalo - one just has to push dry grass from one end to get rich, creamy, fresh, life-giving milk in abundance from the other end. Really, how kind God must be to his human children for creating such a biochemical process as milk formation! What’s more - God endowed the same dairy cow or buffalo that produces milk with the ability to leave behind her own progeny, a reproduced copy, with the very same miraculous biochemical abilities to turn dry unpalatable inedible grass into sweet, creamy milk before she retires or passes away. A milk-vending machine that vends not just milk but also another milk-vending machine!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0One has to sow just one grain of wheat - and it turns into a plant producing more than a hundred grains! Just\\xa0one\\xa0mango – a divinely juicy, delicious, nutritious, pulpy fruit – but it comes with its own seed that if sown and nurtured, turns into a majestic tree that gives\\xa0hundreds\\xa0of juicy mangoes for generations of a human family, year after year. Not just that, the mango even appears by branch grafting, producing whole orchards after orchards of the noble fruit in veritable abundance! Rice, millet or other varieties of different foodgrains with different nutrient profiles and tastes grow in all sorts of climatic conditions – in each case, one gets a whole sack full from one single, sowed grain. The varieties of fruits- pomegranates, bananas, apples, figs, jackfruits, dates… from different climatic profiles follow the same law - just\\xa0one\\xa0sown seed supplies enough fruit for satisfying the needs of at least a small family! All sorts of tasty, nutritious vegetables grow by themselves when kind of “ordered” by the mere act of being sown – the Lord God made this possible for us his human children! Then there’s sugarcane, after all a mere grass – with its weed-like propensity to proliferate wherever water is available. But when humans discovered its sweet juice, it just had to be disciplined into growing within the space allotted to it and nurtured by irrigation before it grew into vast lush stretches of such a generous produce that after being squeezed of its last drop of sweet juice by industrial scale sugar extraction processes, can still provide basic roughage to field oxen from leftovers! In fact, today’s scientists in the field of unconventional energy resources are researching the possibility of employing crops like sugarcane and even weeds from hillsides to generate the bio-fuel ethanol just when the world thought its fossil fuels were getting used up! Truly, when one resource dries up, another becomes available! How\\xa0can\\xa0we humans\\xa0ever\\xa0even quantify, leave alone repay, the kindness that God showered on humankind, making arrangements for every aspect of human existence!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0And what about human anatomy!\\xa0 From the soles of our feet to the most microscopic of the organelles of the brain, the layout of the human body is full of masterly, orderly planning and co-ordination- O Lord, how meticulously Thou hath designed our bodies for us! Our\\xa0human\\xa0eye- how many ages, eons, generations of evolutionary experiments hath Thou conducted to bring our eye to its present capabilities? Initially the eye was just a nervous tissue able to merely make out a ray of light, which could only differentiate illumination from utter darkness, recognize a shadow more than actual details of a form; but by continuous evolutionary experiments, trials and errors, we humans now have our beautiful, spherical, moist – and –\\xa0ambitious\\xa0human eye. Today the human eye is so capable that we humans have the ambitious foresight(!) to beat Thee at Thy own game, by inventing a duplicate eye, an extension, the telescope, to view not just the interiors of Thy own cosmic laboratory of outer space, but to discover none other than\\xa0Thee Thyself\\xa0 somewhere in space!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Further, how\\xa0can\\xa0one ever describe fully the festival of beauty and colours Thou hath conducted in the Three Worlds? The ultra-delicate flower of the Parijaat, the ultra-fragrant Golden Champak flower! The peacock’s vibrant plumage – the colors and design of every feather, the peacock’s inimitable gait! What a natural artist that noble bird is! When I watch the bird spread his plumage, dance with excitement and cry out aloud, believe me, O God, even my heart dances in sync with every step of this gifted bird and cries out Thy glory in admiration of Thy divine creation. In fact, I feel like sulking that\\xa0I\\xa0do not have the wonderful plumage of the peacock. The whole earthly creation resounds with the songs of birds and is a kaleidoscope of pleasant sights and landscapes! Roses, chamelis, bakulis, Juhis, Jaais, Champak, sandalwood, Ketakis… creepers and shrubs in full bloom, whole gardens full of them freshening and lending fragrance to the atmosphere! The Gods of love, Madan and Rati, are busy linking the hearts of lovers! The nights are starry, the dawns are pink, youth is confident and fresh, sleep is sound and deep, and love is like a cool breeze heralding the rhapsody of springtime. There is material and spiritual growth all over… O Lord, how can we humans not help thinking that such a beautiful world was created specially for us by Thee? If we love, nurture, protect and provide for our children, so doth Thee. Thou truly art both our father and mother and we Thy children. Even the milk our mothers give us is given ultimately by you. O Lord, we are Thy devotees and Thou, the Lord God of humankind, the God of Man!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Not just that, Thou art the only God, there can be no other and Thou hath created this world specifically for our peace and prosperity!\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0… This ideology, this concept of “The God of humankind” creating the universe specially for the survival and prosperity of Humankind could indeed have proved truthful and correct – if and only if everything, every being and all conditions in this world would have been only helpful, pleasant, beneficial and useful to humankind.\\xa0\\nBut alas! The cold fact is that most of this earth, the very earth we instinctively consider Mother Earth, Mother Nature and Mother Life is hardly all that safe, protective, kind and considerate to us humans as we were just philosophizing. On the contrary, the living conditions existent on this planet and influences of the atmosphere, the sun, moon and stars in reality seem to contradict our pet theory of faith too much – conditions that obtain on earth are mostly inhospitable, harsh, with the law of the Jungle working all the time around us. Humankind has to struggle for its very survival and struggle still further for ensuring prosperity.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Take a good look at the very Sun and oceans we sung paeans in praise of just some time ago. The way the unsparing rays of the hot sun finish off a helpless victim of sunstroke or heatstroke is quite comparable to the ruthlessness with which a gatekeeper watchman beats a poisonous snake by repeated relentless blows- striking the final blows even when half-dead. In the very India where millions of Hindu Brahmins offer prayers to the Sun God every sunrise and sunset, the very same sun shines hot for the entire spell of a drought or famine, even lasting several years, killing thousands of heatstroke, hunger or thirst.\\xa0\\nIn the Quran, Talmud, Torah and Bible, devout prophets sang in praise of God Yahweh, “For us Humans, O God, Thee hath kept a plentiful supply of fish for us to eat in the oceans!” But the same oceans are also full of creatures like human-eating sharks which can eat a human body alive and whole. The oceans are also teeming with other forms of sea life like poisonous snakes, sting rays, electric rays and the Portuguese-Man-of-war which can either kill, maim or in any other way seriously harm any human form in sea-water – a swimmer or diver, a shipwrecked sailor, a fisherman, marine biologist or oceanologist – the ocean Gods are quite busy nurturing these forms of life harmful to man with sustained impartiality. Quite similar to a mugger who first poses as a traveler’s guide, then waits for an opportune time to shed his mask to finally loot his trusting quarry in the middle of nowhere, the ocean, while carrying afloat thousands of rafts, boats and vessels at a time, suddenly throws some of them off its back and into its terrible jaws to swallow up entire vessels and ocean liners like the doomed Titanic, drowning all the thousands of people aboard in one gulp. Oceans can unpredictably erupt into tsunamis sucking entire populations of coastal settlements into their watery graves.\\xa0\\nRivers in Africa, Australia and South America are full of potentially human-eating creatures like alligators, piranha and crocodiles. The holy rivers, on whose banks civilizations and cities flourished, can swallow up entire townships or at least several thousand helpless people and animals in one spate, be they the Holy Mother Ganges or Jamnaji, the Brahmaputra, Hwang-Ho or Nile, the Holy Jordan or the Father Thames.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Primitive Semitic devotion believed in the Abrahamic Books that the Elohim (Yahweh of the Bible and Allah of the Quran) created the goat, lamb, deer and other creatures so that his believers would get lots of meat to eat! But the devotion with which the believer smacks his lips on seeing “food” animals blinds him to the obvious fact that the same world in which he resides with his “food” animals is also home to potentially man-eating animals like the big wild cats, crocodiles, bears and sharks. If a man-eating Sunderban Royal Bengal tiger preys on an unsuspecting human child and is spotted smacking his lips after devouring the child’s flesh, should we say that God created small human children with tender flesh just so that some man-eater can have a delicious meal? And as if to provide icing on a cake, the world has its share of dangerous vegetarian beasts as well, from the very herbivorous African river hippos that can cut a human form into two in one snap of their jaws (just as easily as we crunch a slice of cucumber at our dinner table), to the grass-munching land giants like the bison or Assamese rhinos and ultimately the largest land mammal, the\\xa0 solitary bull African elephants all of whom are known to kill humans more often than do the carnivorous big cats. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0When a tsunami strikes a coast, it sucks in everything it can from coastal human inhabitation- brides in their own wedding ceremonies about to garland their grooms, mothers suckling their meek hungry and vulnerable infants, artists with unfinished paintings and sculptures, lovers locked mid-ardor oblivious to the world, devotees in mid-meditation with spiritual ecstasy… entire cities like Dwarika and Atlantis, regions and subcontinents have gone under water, got buried under volcanic lava like Pompeii… as quickly as Ganesh devotees immerse a Ganesh idol in the sea – with cataclysmic precision. And yet, the next daybreak, the same Dawn Goddess Usha, who was soulfully venerated with sacred chants of the Vedas, appears as pink as always over the destruction.\\xa0\\nThe Quran quotes that Allah created the moon so that the believer could tell the parts of the day to know when to offer namaz. But when the “infidel’ Chengiz Khan stormed Baghdad, the cultural capital of Islamdom, massacring all Momins in his wake, slaughtering clerics and the Caliph with his family, demolishing the whole city, razing all buildings and walking over a pile of cut heads of killed Muslims, did not the moon still rise over the same Baghdad that night too, informing the namaz-hating Chengiz Khan about the times of the day just as it did the namaz-performing Muslims?\\xa0\\n\\nFragrant flowers, melodiously singing songbirds, the haughty peacock with his inimitable plumage, even entire forests get roasted alive in a single bushfire or forest fire, like we roast a brinjal on a flame. \\nWhile a human population trustingly plays the game of life in the daytime and rests secure every night in the lap of Mother Earth, some particular moment the same terra firma demolishes the unsuspecting population with one earthquake tremor – buildings get flattened, both huts and architecturally marvelous monuments of human creativity and civilisation, like a pack of cards ceases to exist. Entire villages can be swallowed alive in a moment with the same earth opening up a giant crevice in an earthquake!\\xa0\\nHistorically giant meteors have hit the earth and in some cases, even set in massive cycles of climatic change and destruction with extinctions of entire species. Can a flaming comet also not suddenly appear out of the blue (from outer space) and hit the surface of the earth setting ablaze entire regions much like a flaming torch can set ablaze a whole pile of cotton?\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0For every lifestyle there exists a dysfunction. The human body, when diseased, is a museum of pathologies and pain- furuncles, epilepsy, tumours, agony, coma, palpitations, diabetes and heart arrests… The world out there has its rounds of bubonic plagues, famines, cholera epidemics …\\xa0\\nOur faith and belief that humankind is the centre of reference for the whole universe and that not just\\xa0our own\\xa0planet - the earth with her plentiful resources and life forms - but the whole\\xa0cosmos\\xa0was created by God\\xa0only\\xa0for humankind,\\xa0only\\xa0to favour humankind,\\xa0only\\xa0to provide pleasure to humankind and\\xa0only\\xa0out of special partisan fondness for humankind, eventually crystallized into belief systems, some open to contrary thought and other times closed to alternative view-points, like unbending dogma unwilling to confront rationalism. We humans even created religious texts of this dogma, selectively only documenting phenomena supportive of our theory that God first manufactures and then employs even stars, planets, comets, black holes, galaxies and constellations exclusively for sustaining human existence, protecting human life, providing fun, pleasure and entertainment to humans and eternally providing resources to human civilization, happiness and prosperity. This blinkered approach has only blinded us to stark, obvious natural phenomena and unpleasant observations of accidents and natural catastrophes endured by humankind that contradict our doctrine of “God’s Creation for human welfare”. We have to free ourselves of the shackles of this dogmatic conditioning to outgrow our primary assumption and adopt the approach of unbiased reasoning and dispassionate analysis to explain observations both pleasant and unpleasant.\\xa0\\n\\nFaith in this God-of-man theory can best be treated as a development of the primitive emotional human mind at its most innocent, childlike, seeking state. Faith created scripture - we can even marvel at the poetic expressions and emotional inputs that created some devotional scripture. We can pragmatically and patiently hear out, even study with interest all religious, devotional and ritualistic versions of the same God-of-man belief across the world as necessary stepping stones in the evolution of the human mind. Not all scriptures are unbending dogma. Some scriptures and cultures like the Indic (Bhakti-Vedantic, Buddhistic and Jain), Greek, Egyptian (Pre-Arian and Arian) and Far Eastern (Taoist, Confucian, Shinto) showed a readiness to discuss alternate viewpoints freely, while other types of scriptures like the Bible and Quran show the otherwise seeking human mind trapped at some primitive stage of thought not amenable to reasoning, with self-imposed fossilization, in the evolution of human thought processes.\\nIt is\\xa0completely beyond\\xa0human reasoning powers to deduce the real intention due to which or without which this cosmos came into existence even with the best of telescopes, space exploration technology, knowledge of physics and mathematics – or with the most insightful of meditative techniques. We can only reason this much – the world and cosmos are not specially created for man; man matters little to other space bodies, whatever our earthly human thoughts - theist or atheist, scientific or devotional. We humans are only as significant in the big universe as may be some other creature- some worm, germ, bug or bee. In other words, humans are no more than a very ordinary, temporary production in the eternal flow of time and the incessant dynamics of the universe.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Thus, crops do not grow, fruits do not ripen or spices are not delicious so that humankind should be fed good food. Crops grow, hence humans can eat them – that’s all. Rivers do not flow because humankind needs water- on the contrary; we happen to get water because rivers flow. Even when it was the age of the dinosaurs before the evolution of modern humans, rivers had been flowing, flowers were blooming, the stars were twinkling – just as they do so now! Even when the earth was under the grip of the ice age, or even before the very birth of earth, this very own home planet - the sun had its cosmic motion unfazed by anything else. Why, even if this very\\xa0sun\\xa0or our very own Milky Way were to vanish, the rest of the cosmos would be probably as affected as the luminosity of daylight is affected by the death of a firefly. Such an unfazed, unperturbed cosmic power that would not elicit even a moment’s mourning by the sudden nemesis of a hundred suns or solar systems even on a daily basis\\xa0can\\xa0still be venerated as “God” (to satiate human spiritual hunger) but slightly differently - as the “God of the universe” - certainly not as our older conception of “God of Humankind”.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0If our “God of Humankind” would\\xa0not\\xa0have provided even\\xa0elementary\\xa0aids of survival, some minimal resources to exploit or primitive conditions of protection from the wild side of nature, could anyone or anything have stopped Him from disallowing any human existence? Yet, the human race\\xa0did\\xa0get access to natural bounty as comprehended by our five elementary human senses,\\xa0could\\xa0exploit resources and\\xa0could\\xa0modify circumstances to make quite a few habitats hospitable to human survival.\\xa0 Not only did humans survive, they prospered into civilizations. They did not just get a world, they got a rich earth, with rivers of water, edible foods, and useful animals – with fragrant flowers, scenic beauty and melodiously singing birds added in to enliven existence. The human race has eventually flourished so far, certainly not perished!\\nYet, this appearance of human life on earth, juxtaposed in the evolutionary history of the earth, itself juxtaposed in the eternal universal upheaval of creation, sustenance and destruction, is no more than a speck in time, a temporary, ordinary and miniscule event not worth reckoning in the largely unknown, unfathomable history of the universe. Whatever dependability nature has shown with whatever few conditions encouraging human existence on this planet earth, are\\xa0merely a coincidence. So long as this coincidence lasts, so long as we survive as humans, we humans can term this coincidence, this favorable set of circumstances, the “God of Humankind”; we can even offer Him a flower out of devotion and gratitude. To this, and only to this limited extent, can we condescend to say that the “God of Humankind” is kind to, partial towards and protective of his human “children”.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Mentally envisaging the “God of the universe” is merely going logically further in our God-conceptualization exercise. There are two techniques, scientific and spiritual, essentially complementary to each other. Scientifically, we have space shuttles and telescopes augmenting the eye, to note birth of stars or their celestial burial in black holes. Spiritually, ancients reached yogic contemplative planes like Saptapatal, Brahmalok, Vishnulok, Devalok, etc. through meditation augmenting the inner mind. Either way, the universe (or the “God” of the universe) is uninfluenced by prayers, unperturbed by human emotions, unaffected by human birth or death, prosperity or tragedy, too abstract to be affected by anything, partial towards no one, certainly not humans, is equally responsible for both genesis and nemesis. Neither does this power purposefully bless us, nor purposefully punish us. This “God of the universe” is too subtle and omnipotent to be a personality like a jealous Old Testament Yahweh who vindictively resorts to curses against and punishments like sending locusts and frogs against bonded followers trespassing into worshipping alternate God-forms.\\xa0 The power of the “God of the universe” is also not thanks to some seat or tag of authority, like is the case of the celestial Indra (whose power being not his own but by virtue of the\\xa0throne\\xa0of the “ruler of heaven-residing deities”), who insecurely presupposes that anyone engrossed in meditation, sage or demon alike, can get strong enough to usurp his throne and depose him. The “God of the universe” requires no medium like angrily foaming prophets whose careers were nothing more than haranguing people into remaining bonded to the Old Testament books of dogma by issuing dire warnings, or mysterious secretive shamanic witch-doctors sacrificing poor animals to entities like demons and spirits in occult rituals while mumbling to themselves in a state of mind bordering on epilepsy, creating a whole plethora of lesser Gods, demi-Gods and other entities taking their toll tax from a seeker on a spiritual quest on the way towards the real God unluckily trespassing onto their domain of esoteric teritory. The God of the universe could freely be “He”, “She”, even “It” - we don’t know, we can call this force what we want.\\n\\nConceptualising God of this nature requires not just intellectual effort but also spiritual courage. We now have a God to bow before but we must learn to take care of ourselves in individual and collective crises in life within the framework of natural laws,\\xa0praakrutik dharma. If one is the captain of a sinking ship, one should use all knowledge in navigation and ship mechanics to save the ship, passengers and cargo first – all prayers to the God of the ship or the God of the Seas or the God of humankind are only\\xa0after\\xa0all realistic efforts are instituted. Like vitamin B complex helping the main medicine fight an illness, rather than becoming the medicine itself denying other specific medicines the credit of working. Thus the God of humankind is nothing other than one side, namely the bright, congenial side - the feel-good factor - of the God of the Universe. Whether the devotionally conceived God of Humankind partial to humankind or the intellectually conceptualized God of the Universe partial towards no one, we can treat every conception with respect, since we term the conception “God”. Particularly when we have first respected the “God of humankind” and then pulled Him into the morass of half-baked notions of devotion, the “God of the universe” deserves greater respect.\\nWe first invested the conception of the God of humankind with human emotions and personalities, good and bad traits, then invoked Him (or Her) to account for each and every positive or negative personal event and gradually, pulled down Divinity into the mud, demoted the stature of our conception of “divinity” into an entity that serves our selfish interests and base desires by ordinary bribes of prayer. The bigger our personal desire, the more flamboyant or expectant our prayer gets - the “God of Humankind” would do us good if we conduct some sacrificial rite, organize a Satyanarayana Pooja, attend successive masses of Novena or repeatedly visit a fakir’s mausoleum. Imagining any covenant with the “God of Humankind” simply ties us up in illogical knots - if we offer prayers of gratitude to God for saving us from danger, then who presented us with these dangers in the first place? The same “God”! First He slits our neck and then He heals it. If we should worship Him for healing us, should we also not full-fledgedly blame Him first for hurting us? It is like the story of two roadside beggars fighting amongst each other saying, “I am right, you are wrong” and desperately but unsuccessfully trying to get the judgment of superiority from an emperor whose retinue passing momentarily by their way – the emperor does not even notice, the convoy passes ahead and the two beggars go back to wrestling each other in the muck. Well, invoking the “God of Humankind” for these twin emotional outbursts of blaming and thanking, for every worthless and inconsequential event of life, is worse than the fight of these two roadside beggars. The age and limits of our universe are too big to even be measured - human devotional tantrums do not matter at all.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0What is\\xa0rational\\xa0is that we can study, infer, discover, analyse, comprehend, teach each other and then recode for posterity the\\xa0laws\\xa0by which the universe and its components exist, govern themselves and act or interact. We can then try and align ourselves with the laws of the functioning of nature and the universe in ways beneficial to the human race, conducive to our survival. This is the only thing possible for us humans. Thus any act, behaviour or conduct of a human being conducive and helpful to the survival of the whole human race and to our habitat (the earth and “her” environment) in the long term is\\xa0good, ethical and correct\\xa0behaviour. On the contrary, any thought or conduct that can make us perish or destroy our own habitat, anything that can adversely affect human survival or can be a deterrent to long-term human survival of our human habitat is\\xa0bad, unethical and incorrect\\xa0behaviour. This definition of human ethics is workable, rational and clear to understand. But beliefs like “What ‘God’ likes is ethical” and “That which is helpful to Humans is liked by God” are untrue and untenable, in fact too childish to sustain. We need to realize that we are part of the universe, but the universe is not ours or ruled by us. To a negligible extent the universe favours us. To a much greater extent, the universe is unfavourable to us. Accepting this truth clearly, bravely and unhesitatingly is being both human and humane. And this is the true religion of the entire human race, the true worship of the “God of the universe”.\", 'Really profound but lengthy post.', ' the purusharth of veer savarkar ji is an inspiration.\\n\\nHis whole life is a testament to the power of sheer will.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha.

For one definition we know Dharm means righteousness. If Krishn's Dharm means righteousness then what does he mean by righteousness. Is it the righteousness of action, or the results? In the Mahabharat Kaurav took the land and exiled Pandav. Kaurav basically symbolize a behaviour which is to be considered as bad and many a times abhorrent. Not respecting the women, confiscating properties, later refusing to return what's not theirs, breaking laws, not being Just despite being the rulers, trying to kill their family members and many more thing I might not be aware of. This is to be punished and maybe this is what Krishna means. Maybe justice is the idea of Krishn's version of Dharm.   My primary argument was that Krishna did many of the acts which can be associated with trickery, deceit and slyness. But he did everything to bring justice. He's like the one of the most Griffindors in the Griffindor house, break the rules to do good. Like Harry, Hermione and Ron would break the rules to to do good here Krishna is doing just the same. The good should rule not matter the means.  The major antagonist in the story is Duryodhan, he is the source of all the conflict and rest of the characters in Kaurav's side revolve around the whims and wishes of this character. If this person was eliminated from the story the basis of whole Mahabharat would collapse. Naturally Dhritrastr would return the land and Kingdom to the Pandav brothers, may even the whole kingdom.   So, Duryodhan is the biggest plot point of the story. But there's one more plot point which is as much important. And it is  Kurn. Despite Krishna's knowledge that he was son of Kunti he did not allow Kurn to participate in Draupadi's Swayamvar for the obvious reasons that Krishn wanted Draupadi to marry Arjun and not Kurn. Why would Krishn do that? Krishn being a god knew the future can was well aware about the war. He was who took it to the level of war. Had he wanted he'd have killed Duryodhan long back during Draupadi cheerharan and punished Pandav brothers to use Draupadi in the game, all in the name of Dharm.  The point is, if you are an omniscient being where you could do anything, you are the one who is running the game. The war was not a result of one but a number of incidents, of which the omniscient being was part of many. It is not wrong to say that the war was Krishn's will.  But why? Answer is maybe the whole point of designing the situations which would lead to war is to set an example. The example to show the world that in the way of being righteous even if you have to kill your family members it's the right thing to do.\", 'What is Hinduism iSo what I learned in school about Hinduism is basically reincarnation and they believe in lots of gods also they cant eat meat.

Btw, if you don\\'t want to read my backstory, just skip to the bottom. I don\\'t suggest it though, because I have the feeling that someone is supposed to read this, and this is all meant to be happening for a reason.\\n\\n\\nOkay, my first step in this post is going to be describing to you a brief td;lr of my life, and then a more detailed explanation of what\\'s been happening to me for the past 3 or so weeks.\\n\\nOkay, for the TD;LR of my life:\\nParents were always strict Christians, but I denied it all my life and followed my instincts, trying things, studying, meditating, praying, ext. I was always insanely interested in knowledge, history in specific, and spirituality even more.\\n\\nI\\'ve spent the last 2 - 3 or so years (I\\'m 18 years old as of writing this), I\\'ve been focusing on spirituality in a very hardcore manner (even more serious than everything from before combined), studying constantly, spending all my time either meditating or studying. I\\'ve studied Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Taoism, and many Nordic beliefs, and finally Satanism (not Christian\\'s version. There\\'s a form of Satanism that has nothing to do with Christianity, and teaches similar ideas to Hinduism. I thought that was it for me, because it preached about you growing your own soul through meditation, yoga, using energy to open your soul, see into the Psychic realm (non-human beings), open your chakras and to unite the female and male sides of your soul, with the ultimate goal being raising your Kundalini serpent past the last chakra and achieving Godhood yourself. I know what I was doing 100% had some effect, but in the end I realized it was only an illusion too, with only hints of truth to distract you from the truth. I came to peace with that, and it took me a very, very, very long time to do that completely.\\n\\n\\nWARNING: In this next section I am going to explain my experiences over the last three weeks, and how it has changed me into a different man, along with some general backround knowledge. During these three weeks ONLY, I was basically under the influence of Marijuana, but I would like to remind all of you, that mind altering substances have been used as a helping hand in spiritual growth for millennia, including Hinduism. I have no further desire for the substance, and will never touch it again. However, I do not regret doing it. Because of my choices, here I am today, and I regard these three weeks as an experience given to me by a higher power, and I\\'d like to explain that.\\n\\nA lot of symbolic things happened that has relevance to Hinduism. For example, the entire three weeks, I would play Overwatch, meditate, and sleep. I ate maybe four or five times the entire three weeks (not because of the fact that I thought I had to starve myself, I just genuinely didn\\'t need to). I felt a strong draw to my PS4 specifically, not for the game, not for the console, but for use as a conduit in ways. I look at it, and yes, it appears to be a PS4, but I can see so much more on the flip-side. It is a tool to connect you to people and to compete. During these 3 weeks, I would play Zenyatta on Overwatch to represent myself going through a spiritual journey, and as I would take the next steps in this journey, I would become better at playing him. And then I started to think, maybe me playing Overwatch on my PS4 is proving my skill on another level of existance? Or triggering something in the future, past, or in a parallel reality?\\n Because I didn\\'t play Overwatch in a traditional sense. I used my emotions to fuel my skill. It was like I was using my mind to control the controller directly, no longer needing to use my body to move, just dictating my body commands from a different perspective. What I would do was force myself to feel a specific way, depending on what the scenario needed. If we were losing a checkpoint, I would fuel all of the rage inside of me into defending it, always focusing on the objective. And I would destroy. Imagining past battles in history, imagining the pain that people had to deal with, everything. I channeled whatever feeling the situation needed into the situation.\\n\\nI started to get noticed, and then something weird started happening that marked the start of this long 3 week journey. I was in Quick Play, and I was talking to this boy, maybe 14, or 15 years old? And he bore a striking resemblance to me when I was younger. For the entire journey after meeting him, almost every single game I would play in Overwatch, would have him in it, without me inviting him, having him as a friend, or anything. Just random matches, but always the same person under a different name. I even ran into him on the PC edition of the game. Remember earlier when I said symbolism with the beliefs of Hinduism? It\\'s like the same scenario with Shiva. You revere Shiva as the only God, but there are many others that lead to him, and just like that system of beliefs, I always ran into this boy.\\n\\n\\nSo I thought to myself, he has to be my guide, right? This has to be it.\\nI started meditating on it and was thinking about it, and came to the conclusion (I was a Satanist at the time as described earlier) that Satan was trying to guide me towards a path of enlightening the world, a path in which everyone would leave material desires behind and embracing a life of peace and true wisdom. But over the three weeks, I realized, there was no such thing happening (not in the way I thought anyways) ~~ I meditated for nearly 12 hours a day, ate only 4 or 5 times total the entire 3 weeks, and had absolutely no short term memory. There were days were I was so disconnected from myself, that I didn\\'t even know who I was or what I was, moving like a robot with no goals, nothing. It became hard to exist, hard to think, hard to speak, hard to interact with the world. I was in seclusion for weeks, and it was almost like controlling my body from a higher point of view. Like in a RTS game, controlling an entire squad at once for example. I felt like one of the soldiers ready to die for the cause. Coming to peace with everything took awhile, but I came to the point where I left the world behind completely in my own mind, and I was ready to start a new life with a new name and complete this journey. I gave many tests to this spiritual force, and many things did happen. I realized now it had not been Satan guiding me, but something else. And then I looked into Hinduism out of nowhere (it popped into my head randomly) and saw how Shiva is regarded. And I did further research and discovered the belief that all different paths all lead to the same thing. And there was SOOOO much Symbolism in those three weeks happening with the exact same idea. And I gained the ability (limited at this point in the story) to see (not really with my eyes, kind of like a mental awakening) more truly than ever before. I look at my monitor now, and don\\'t see a TV exactly, I see that it can be many things, and be used for many things. While I was on this spiritual journey, I noticed also that there was a full moon every night. I didn\\'t realize it at first, but I counted at least 6 days where there were full moons (which is impossible?). I would sleep during the day and wake up at night, meditate, meditate, and hone my hand eye coordination with Overwatch (right now I have basically aimbot level skill with Zenyatta). I used Overwatch as a tool to dig up my deepest feelings basically in a sense (the feelings I had suppressed when I was very young). When I would get killed, I would be furious, and then I would try to amplify that feeling, and try to come back and get revenge, and it worked a few times, but then it just made me worse and worse in skill. And I realized at that moment, that I had to come to peace with myself, that I needed to live life not driven by greed or selfish desires. So I meditated, and I asked myself, why does it make you bad? And I figured out something I never thought I would. While meditating, I started to see things clearly, with distractions pushed to the side. I realized I wanted to not only be important, but I wanted to serve, and bring peace to the world in any way I could. And I was angry because I was suppressing that, not knowing what I wanted to do with my life at all, going from job to job not happy. Even now, I still dream of a world where people can leave greed aside and focus on the spiritual truths of life, living a simplistic yet rewarding life. But then, this triggered an even deeper awakening of my mind, and I started to see the duality in every action of life, every decision. I started to realize things, and see deep on levels I never thought possible. Let\\'s say you walk to the fridge with the goal of getting some water, but then you decide you don\\'t want water in the end? What happens to that thought? What happens to that possibility, that alternate choice? I believe in the principle of duality ~ harmony and chaos. But I also believe there is a middle ground beyond harmony and chaos, a grey zone. What if I could experience all of the possibilities in my previous example? What if with all of those lost memories, forgotten in time, there is a way to bring it back and experience it, to keep it as part of you and to grow from it, to let it guide you? Have you ever thought about ancient humanity, the day to day life of people, their rituals, their way of life. I have, and I wish I could learn everything, and be a voice that continues the traditions going.\\n\\nI\\'m someone that desires knowledge more than anything, particularly about spirituality. I devoted my life to nothing but the study of truth long ago, and that\\'s what led me here today. I do believe in the principle of duality, but I also do believe in an even greater state of being. A combination of chaos and peace, using it for each situation as a guide. It may not be possible in this life, but my goal is to learn everything, simply put. I want to know everything about everything, no matter the cost to me, physically, mentally, or spiritually. Everything I\\'ve been through has left me with a burning passion that is more powerful than any obstacle. I say now that I will learn everything, and I will defy what I know, because think about it. In this situation, you can choose the middle ground, but there are instances I believe in which you can change what the middle ground actually is, incorporating duality itself into the middle ground that Buddha spoke about. And I believe this is one of those scenarios. Yes, I can choose to know everything, yes, I can choose to know nothing. But what if I want to know everything, and nothing at the same time? To look at existence itself from a 3rd party view, to see it all, be able to experience it, to experience time out of sequence, to be able to relive everything like watching a recorded movie. What if I want to spiritually grow and go past levels of existence even comprehendable by myself (and trust me, I can comprehend a lot of stuff) ~~ But still remember moments like this that defined that journey? Me writing this post, my dog laying on my couch, it being nice and sunny outside but not too hot, and to be able to incorporate even simple memories like this, and experience true knowledge, wisdom, logic, into teachings, in order to expand the minds of others?\\n\\nWhat I desire the most, is to be a servant to truth itself. Making it be known, all illusions aside. To lift the veil that\\'s been cursing humanity for many, many years.\\n\\nI realize this sounds weird, but I have the feeling that Shiva was guiding me in one way or another, because there were a lot of things that happened during this journey. While I thought it was Satan guiding me, at least I knew it was something, and now I realize it could have been Shiva in a different form. There were many days were I felt dead inside during these three weeks. I renounced everything and left it behind, trying to take the path of complete peace and abandon chaos. I realize now, that it\\'s impossible. For peace to exist, there must be struggle. It\\'s all part of the journey. It was very painful, not clinging to emotions, leaving everything behind. I felt like a robot, with no purpose. And then my memory started to go down the drain, and it came to the point were I had no memory, I had no identity, I had nothing. I realized then when I left everything behind that I was clinging onto delusions, and I had to take the middle path, as there cannot be life without death, on any level of existence. I thought I had to die physically. I\\'d convinced myself, I\\'d lay down in my bed, go to sleep, and whatever God existed would make it so I would wake up in another life. I talked in my head with someone and said, will I die tonight when I go to sleep? And that person said \"Yes, but not in the way you expect.\" I could see him too, in a way. Like... A picture hidden behind a veil. He honestly looked like Gandhi, minus the glasses and a bit younger looking than photographs online show, and standing straight up. I woke up the next day and thought of it all as fake and said forget life and gave up. And my mind crumbled into Chaos. I knew at the time my spiritual beliefs were a deception, and I said I\\'m finally done living. I got to the point where I accepted death, embraced the feelings of nothingness and savored it, almost getting turned on in a sadistic way by the thoughts of the many ways I could die. But then when it never happened, it triggered something in me that not only destroyed me physically, mentally, and spiritually, it awakened me, and I rebuilt from the rubble of my old weak mind. There was a point where there was nothing. And I meditated, because I wanted to feel something. Then I came to the conclusion I didn\\'t need to die, and I wasn\\'t going to yet. Before, I thought my purpose was to die, be reincarnated into a new life, and save the world spiritually in a sense (true Satanists believe in reincarnation also) ~ but then I realized, the goal was never to die physically. Through this entire journey, something was guiding me, telling me exactly what to do, what to say, what to feel. I felt like a slave, trapped in a body, wanting to move on. And then I meditated, and I thought about my suffering, and thought about why I wanted to die so bad truly, and then the illusions started slipping away, and peace started to come back. And in that instant, it was like that previous life of mine had been destroyed, and I finally found my way to the middle path. It triggered a feeling in me of death on all levels, including mentally. I thought I was completely dead on every level, but then I started to meditate, and think, and use my experiences in the past as a guide, like putting together a puzzle. I realized, what I wanted to do with my life was truly dedicate myself to my study, and to help spread knowledge and wisdom. I wanted to be the black sheep that would take all of the pain, and show everyone the true way, the \"easy\" way. But then I realized the duality with my next awakening. Ignorance is a bliss, and the path of knowledge is not for everyone, and I realized then that there was no \"easy\" way. I realized that yes, I\\'ve been through a journey all of my life, but so has everyone else, and so will everyone else. And while I may be able to guide people the right direction, it will be on them to find peace within themselves. No God, no person, nobody can do it but themselves, because I realized that you have to WANT the truth, to SEE the truth. I would like to emphasize with everyone here, I have an insanely strong mind in a spiritual and mental sense. When I was a child, I was tormented by insomnia and \"evil thoughts\" and had terrible thoughts in my head when I would try to go to sleep, and one day I decided the only way I would be happy was to destroy it. So I stopped thinking. After a few weeks, it became natural, and to this day, I still have a clear head, with not a thought going through it. But, through those three weeks? It was the opposite, and I experienced for the entire three weeks the suffering and chaos I had suppressed. And after all of the mental rubble and debris got cleaned up, I came out stronger than ever before.\\n\\nREAD THIS: I thought this important to denote, I was instantly drawn specifically to Shaivism when researching about Hinduism. And looking now on Wikipedia, it seems many of the things and experiences I\\'ve been through aligns perfectly with what Shaivites beleive.

I live in the USA, and I\\'m German, and I know it\\'s probably unheard of someone coming to this path of life, from where I come from, but I would like to move to India and renounce my past life eventually. I want to know what I can do to get started on my journey, because honestly, I\\'m out of clues. I will do research and continue to grow, but advice would be appreciated. You can\\'t exactly google how to move to India and join a group of people (I\\'ll give an example, the Hindu equivalent of becoming a Buddhist monk and devoting himself to his studies, living in a temple) ~ I have done a little bit of research and I know it\\'s possible, so I would like to skip the Second Ashrama and choose the path of becoming a Sannyasa, no matter how long it takes. I know I\\'m 18 years old, but I feel that this is my true calling. And I feel once I reach that point, I can go even further than that. At the moment, I don\\'t know too much about Hinduism in a deep sense, so I\\'m going to do a lot more research, and start living a lifestyle of a Shaivite specifically to prepare myself (as this is the system of beliefs that I align with absolutely 100% without a doubt, and it just feels right to me naturally). But if you guys understand what I desire, and you know anything that can help me on my journey, I would so appreciate any knowledge.\\n\\n2nd question, is it possible that I am a reincarnation of some type of philosopher? The only reason I ask this is because I\\'m drawn very strongly not only to Shaivism, but to the Dharma, to the truths of life, and to the dualities of life. It\\'s like... I\\'m being guided by memories I can\\'t remember, but they\\'re still influencing me and helping me grow, and slowly unlocking more and more of my mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnnd that\\'s it\\nIf you read all of this, thanks a lot. I ask anyone that reads all of this and has knowledge that could help me, to give a response. I also ask that you take your time to write it and really try to help me out. I know, this is all a lot to take in and respond to, but can\\'t you see my passion? It won\\'t be a waste of time putting your heart into a response, because I am devoted now to this.\\n\\nThank you, everyone! \\nSorry for the INSANELY long post, by the way.

Dritharaashtra, I feel, more than the love for his son remained mute because he had essentially no power over his sons. But surely the pitamagan could have stopped this incident and in effect kept the escalation between the cousins in check. Doing so would have meant no war if you think about it. Is there an explanation of this somewhere?\\n\\nAlso shout out to Karna, he has become my favorite character from the epic.', 'There are different interpretations of this. \\n\\nThe interpretation that made most sense to me was that throughout Mahabharata, there is an overbearing theme of people doing silly things for the sake of following through their promises and doing their \"dharma\".

Yudishtira had to stake his wife because it was against the dharma to refuse a game of dice. etc. etc.)\\n\\nKrishna\\'s message and actions point to following the Dharma (ethics) by the spirit and not by the letter. A lot of Krishna\\'s actions are perceived as deception by the other characters in the story, but the reader almost always feels right about Krishna doing them. Even at the end, when Arjuna hesitates to attack the Kauravas because it is against the rules of his Dharma, Krishna encourages him to go forward by making him follow the higher calling. \\n\\nNow, there are a significant number of people who follow different interpretations, and disagree that that was Krishna\\'s message.

So its really the king playing the game.\\nc)Bhishma has technically no role in the court when the game is being played. He's merely an advisor. Intruding into the game overriding the king is technically traitorous.\\nd)Bhishma's role is to provide advise as per his promise to his step mother Satyavathi and to not rule the state. So interfereing directly would indeed be breaking this promise. \\n\\nSo it makes perfect sense for him not to intervene in the political context.\\n\\nHowever, I also refute the idea that his intervening would have brought peace.\\n\\nDuri was drunk with envy.

Which is what they tried, but it failed for the most part.\\n\", \"Bheesma was always trying to be technically correct. For example, he fought for the Kauravas despite knowing that they had Krishna against them, which is a huge red flag for your side. It's not like he was after money or power or driven by his emotions like Duryodhana. But his idea was that he'd follow dharma, and since he was a subject of the king, he'd fight for the king.\\n\\nIf you read that part of the Mahabharata, Bheesma is asked about his opinion on whether Duryodhana broke dharma or not. Bheesma says he cannot reach a conclusion, but the conflict he shows is legal. He is unable to decide if the handing over of Draupadi was legally correct or not. So he took no ethical stand against it and since he couldn't reach a legal opinion, he kept quiet. \\n\\nYou can contrast him with Vidura, who always went by principles, and he protested against Duryodhana's actions.

What was beyond the Vindhyas was defined by Indo European migrations( First by the primary Indo Europeans - Originators of contemporary Hinduism) and later followed by Kushans, Scythians and others. However, One would assume that these movements were of noo consequence to the Southerners for a very long period of time.I would like to discuss about this era.However, after a period of Indo European expansion, Hindi Sanskrit IE influence starting streaming down South, where Southern Chieftans took sides and assistance in a game of one-upmanship.\\n\\nSo, basically we have two Proto Dravidian Kingly lines, possibly from the same families who rule the West(Cheras, now Kerala) and East(Cholas, Chennai, or Tamil Nadu). It is interesting to note that the Cholas took Brahminical help when it came to Metaphysics, especially the Shiva -Vishnu combine(Hari Hara), their Children and extended families for a small example. Its well known that Raja Raja Chola became a Hindu inspired by a Hindu priest( Elite migration into the protected South?) and went on to build huge monuments, usually at the expense of the Tamil locals becoming stone labourers. \\n\\nIts also interesting to note that the Chera Kings  discouraged Hinduism(Swadharma System- propogated in the Gita or Vedic Varnshrama). They had preferred the Assyrians , and Babylonian Traders for Metal Working upgrades and shared Metaphysical Concepts from them.I believe that due to this reason the Hindu epics refer to Kerala Kings as Asuras, who had Shukra(Pleasure instead of Asceticism) for a teacher.\\n\\nThe Cheras(Asuras in another sense) with Kings such as Mahabali, Ravana(Ra- Sun, Vana - Sky - Basically a Title) were defeated(Or Land Restricted) after a long Hindu campaign over thousands of years.This involved military activity(Parashuram), population tactics(Vishnu Vamana as the Dwarf Brahmin), Krishna vs Kamsa(Note Kamsas real father was a Rakshasa), Rama vs Ravana (Whatever might be the reasons).\\n\\nAnd by the end of the campaigns we see that the real Cheras are displaced by the fake Cheras. We can see the second Chera dynasty having Sanskrit names like  Verma, Rama, Ravi instead of the First Chera Malayala names such as Nedum Cheralathan, Uthiyan etc.However they are not finished yet, we see a particular group of socialists in Kerala seize the Central Heartland (they are a mix of native+west semitic, native Assyrian-Babylonian, Native Arab Children) and the new Chera Kings are forced South into Travancore, Feudal Warriors(Native Chekavars)  Seize Northern Kerala and the Hindu Kings(Zamorin) is restricted to the Extreme North.So, we can see that the First Cheras become feudal landlords for a period of time and then later displace the second Cheras and the first Cheras re-emerge  and Brahminism was eventually banned in recent times and Kerala is a communist state till now with Cow Slaughter not only permissible, but encouraged for meat eating practices, usually along with a serving of fresh toddy.

To sum it up it\\'s a long-running jrpg series that is usually set in an apocalyptic setting and revolves around ideological conflict, this includes:\\n\\n1. The law side which fights for order and archives to create a socialist utopia represented by the judeo-christian angels\\n\\n2. It\\'s opposition, the Chaos faction that strives to create a dystopian anarchy so \"only the strong can survive\" and limitless freedom can be accomplished that is represented by the judeo-christian fallen angels/demons\\n\\n3. and the neutral side which denounces both so humanity can follow the best of both sides, which results in it being unstable and suseptable to more ideological wars, and is represented by humans and sometimes even random pagan gods and goddesses.\\n\\nNow, some of you may be familiar to [this little controversy](http://nichegamer.com/2016/02/03/hindus-are-pissed-that-krishna-is-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final/) that happened over a year ago (i\\'m not sure how repeatable the source is, so take it with a grain of salt), which actually inspired me to write this post so i can present what krishna is in-game to those not familiar with it. To begin, i\\'ll just say he\\'s more than just a summonable ally, he plays a major role in the story actually.\\n\\nnow that i\\'ve quickly boiled down the basics of the series, maybe you are wondering what that role in the latest game is. Well, i can\\'t really do this without spoiling the game\\'s plot, but here i go: after he is unsealed he preaches about how yahweh trapped souls into the material realm so they are forced to cling to him via the circle of law-chaos (i could go more into detail, but that\\'d make this post a lot longer than it already is). Krishna\\'s plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy.

I\\'ve been Agnostic/Atheist for the past 20+ years and this is the closest thing I have ever found to believing in a \"god\" so I would love to learn more. Sorry for my ignorance, but do the Hindu\\'s have churches or gathering places? Thanks for any info and I hope the below will help someone like it has helped me. \\n\\nYou can read the book \"On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are\" for free here: http://www.leary.ru/download/watts/Book%20On%20The%20Taboo%20Against%20Knowing%20Who%20You%20Are.pdf\\n\\nAnd here is the quote from the book that I just loved and turned me onto reading more about the Vendata Philosophy. \\n\\n\"There was never a time when the world began, because it goes round and round like a circle, and there is no place on a circle where it begins. Look at my watch, which tells the time; it goes round, and so the world repeats itself again and again. But just as the hour-hand of the watch goes up to twelve and down to six, so, too, there is day and night, waking and sleeping, living and dying, summer and winter. You can\\'t have any one of these without the other, because you wouldn\\'t be able to know what black is unless you had seen it side-by-side with white, or white unless side-by-side with black.\\n\\n\"In the same way, there are times when the world is, and times when it isn\\'t, for if the world went on and on without rest for ever and ever, it would get horribly tired of itself. It comes and it goes. Now you see it; now you don\\'t. So because it doesn\\'t get tired of itself, it always comes back again after it disappears. It\\'s like your breath: it goes in and out, in and out, and if you try to hold it in all the time you feel terrible. It\\'s also like the game of hide-and-seek, because it\\'s always fun to find new ways of hiding, and to seek for someone who doesn\\'t always hide in the same place.\\n\\n\"God also likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside God, he has no one but himself to play with. But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself. He pretends that he is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, all the plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when he wakes up they will disappear.\\n\\n\"Now when God plays hide and pretends that he is you and I, he does it so well that it takes him a long time to remember where and how he hid himself. But that\\'s the whole fun of it—just what he wanted to do. He doesn\\'t want to find himself too quickly, for that would spoil the game. That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be himself. But when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will wake up, stop pretending, and remember that we are all one single Self—the God who is all that there is and who lives for ever and ever.\\n\\n\"Of course, you must remember that God isn\\'t shaped like a person. People have skins and there is always something outside our skins. If there weren\\'t, we wouldn\\'t know the difference between what is inside and outside our bodies. But God has no skin and no shape because there isn\\'t any outside to him. [With a sufficiently intelligent child, I illustrate this with a Möbius strip—a ring of paper tape twisted once in such a way that it has only one side and one edge.] The inside and the outside of God are the same. And though I have been talking about God as \\'he\\' and not \\'she,\\' God isn\\'t a man or a woman. I didn\\'t say \\'it\\' because we usually say \\'it\\' for things that aren\\'t alive.\\n\\n\"God is the Self of the world, but you can\\'t see God for the same reason that, without a mirror, you can\\'t see your own eyes, and you certainly can\\'t bite your own teeth or look inside your head. Your self is that cleverly hidden because it is God hiding.\\n\\n\"You may ask why God sometimes hides in the form of horrible people, or pretends to be people who suffer great disease and pain. Remember, first, that he isn\\'t really doing this to anyone but himself. Remember, too, that in almost all the stories you enjoy there have to be bad people as well as good people, for the thrill of the tale is to find out how the good people will get the better of the bad. It\\'s the same as when we play cards. At the beginning of the game we shuffle them all into a mess, which is like the bad things in the world, but the point of the game is to put the mess into good order, and the one who does it best is the winner. Then we shuffle the cards once more and play again, and so it goes with the world.\"\\n\\nThis story, obviously mythical in form, is not given as a scientific description of the way things are. Based on the analogies of games and the drama, and using that much worn-out word \"God\" for the Player, the story claims only to be like the way things are. I use it just as astronomers use the image of inflating a black balloon with white spots on it for the galaxies, to explain the expanding universe. But to most children, and many adults, the myth is at once intelligible, simple, and fascinating. By contrast, so many other mythical explanations of the world are crude, tortuous, and unintelligible. But many people think that believing in the unintelligible propositions and symbols of their religions is the test of true faith. \"I believe,\" said Tertullian of Christianity, \"because it is absurd.\"', \"Oh great, Alan Watts. So anyway, I don't know which part of America you're from OP, considering you're asking if Hindus have places of worship. Ever heard of a temple? \\n\\nAnyway, Alan Watts is only good for an introduction, since he mixes and matches stuff which don't mix and match. For example, he downplays the word God, which Hindus won't do. \\n\\nThe school of Vedanta you're referring to is known as Advaita Vedanta, one of three major Vedantic schools. \\n\\nThere is a new site on Advaita Vedanta which is based on the traditional lineage of teaching, you can check it out [here](http://discovervedanta.com/).\", 'I would recommend the works of Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, and Sri Ramana Maharshi if you are interested in learning more about modern Advaita Vedanta.  \\n\\nJai Maa.', \"Since you're american I recommend Dennis waite's books which might be a good introduction to advaita as he is someone who has read and practiced a lot.

Practices are aimed at material well being or of a 'spiritual' nature(more precisely, to free up one's conditioning and to get out of repetitive cycles of behaviour).

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \\n\\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \\n\\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\\n\\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\\n\\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\\n\\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \\n\\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*', 'The Symbolism of Ganesh ChaturthiIt is pitiable to depict Lord Ganapati [Ganesha] with the head of the elephant and offer Him grass and leaves, treating Him as an animal. \\n\\nThe story itself is absurd because is says that Lord Shiva cuts the head of Ganapati. It is said that Lord Shiva was ignorant of Ganapati, who was brought to life as the son of Goddess Parvati. How ignorant is this fabrication! \\n\\nLord Shiva is said to be the deity of Knowledge (Jnanam Maheswaraat). He is Sarvajna or omniscient. Is such a story not insulting to Lord Shiva, who is the ultimate Lord? \\n\\nGanapati means the Lord of the devotees of His innermost circle, who are liberated souls. He is the ultimate Lord who comes down to this earth in human form to play with His devotees here. Ignorance is at its maximum on earth and therefore this world is an excellent playground for His divine play or game. \\n\\nHe comes down along with the devotees belonging to His innermost circle called as Gana (Kridayantam aharnisham—Shankara). This story can be likened to a boy who calls his closest friends to play a game or a person who goes to see and enjoy a cinema along with his family members. \\n\\nThe ultimate Parabrahman, who descends down in the human form along with His innermost devotees, for the divine play on this earth is Ganapati (Gananaantva—Veda). \\n\\nWhat is the meaning of the elephant-head? It means the nature of an elephant.\\n\\nThe head represents the intelligence or Buddhi of an elephant and not the head of the elephant physically. We scold a stupid person and call him a donkey. It means that his inner nature is like that of the donkey and not his physical form.\\n\\nWhat is the nature of an elephant? It is said “Gajaana mati Bhirutvam’, which means that the elephant has enormous strength but it forgets its own strength and is always afraid of everything. Similarly, when the Lord comes down, He imposes ignorance on Himself to enjoy the role. The actor should forget himself in the role if he wants to fully enjoy his character. Therefore, the Lord forgets His divine strength and acts like a Jeeva (soul), fearing the onslaught of troubles in this world.\\n\\nThe Veda says that fear is a characteristic of the limited soul (Atha tasya Bhayam Bhavati). Only by being fearful can the Lord fully enjoy and also do full justice to the role.\\n\\nIt is said that Goddess Parvati prepared the body of Ganapati and also introduced life into it. This statement has an inner spiritual meaning. Goddess Parvati represents Maya. When the Lord incarnates in this world, Maya prepares the human body and also introduces life, which is Para Prakriti, into it.\\n\\nTherefore, life or awareness is only a part of creation and is not Parabrahman. \\n\\nGanapati also shows five faces like Shiva. This indicates that Parabrahman indicated by the word Shiva has entered the human body. Ganapati is said to be the husband of Siddhi and Buddhi. Siddhi and Buddhi are not two ladies although they are symbolically shown to be so. \\n\\nBuddhi means knowledge associated with logical analysis. Siddhi means attainment. You have to attain the Lord in human form, who is the Satguru by logical analysis, so that you can eliminate fraud preachers. Siddhi means the attainment of the Lord in human form.\\n\\nYou should take the inner sense of Lord Ganesha’s story, which alone is the truth.\\n\\nScholars explain the concept in a symbolic language for the sake of illiterate and ignorant people. \\n\\nGanapati is said to be very brave, having stood against even Lord Shiva. This means that when the Lord is with full knowledge in His original form, He is fully aware of His divine strength. But when the head of Ganapati is replaced by the head of an elephant, He forgot all his divine strength and was afraid of everything. \\n\\nThis is a symbolic story. \\n\\nThe actual meaning is that the Lord in his original form is fully aware of Himself and His power. But when he comes down in human form, He forgets His divine strength and fears like an ordinary soul. This gives full enjoyment to the Lord in the human role. \\n\\nThe vehicle of the huge Ganapati is a small rat. This means that when you enter the service of the Lord, you need not think about your capacity to serve Him. By the will and power of the Lord, you’ll gain the capability to serve Him.

Maya in simple terms is defined as space, time and causation. All the objective quantities in the universe which we can perceive through our senses and mind (in the form of thoughts, beliefs, etc) all come under Maya. Within maya, one objective quantity can be simplified and explained in terms of other objective quantity.  In particular, all your questions regarding karma are of this type.\\n\\nBut all of maya is just an appearance of the ultimate truth; Atman(which is very loosely translated as soul, whose meaning varies from context to context), which encompasses all the objective happenings in maya. The Atman is not an object, rather, it is that which illumines every objective experience in maya. Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya.

The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis. Many of them go this way because, they cannot just simply accept what someone tells them, they need to see it, feel it, make it, experience it and realise and understand it themselves.

What does reconciliation of these two really mean, does it mean you give up on one of the paths ?

I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.).

I am happy, therefore I want to share this opportunity with others.\\n\\nBrahmacharya is a life of a monk, it\\'s a commitment to restrict oneself from sense gratification, and focus on your spiritual growth. Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek.

For a time we identify with the roles being played as real characters (when in reality they are just actors).\\n\\nAren't we into the role of our self (lower-case 's') right now and can't we enjoy expansion of that self in love and being free?\", 'Much of this confusion is due to promiscuous usage of language. Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point. Till we attain moksha which is the same as realizing that we are eternally Brahman, the normal rules of morality, human ends, meaning etc all apply. \\n\\nTo give an example, we all know that the world is made of fundamental particles of various kinds. However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels. All this everything is me etc is just a vessel to carry you to the truth and the vessel has to be abandoned one day, too. Like a boat, incredibly useful - to the other side of the river, then you abandon it and walk.\\n\\nWe use a thorn analogy, we use a thorn (advaita vedanta) to remove another thorn (human suffering) and then we discard both.\\n\\nAll this I am consciousness and everyone is me, etc etc will be refined and transformed. There is no I, consciousness is not an I. The I is the ego it\\'s ahaṃkara and consciousness is something completely different. The fact you can see the object of I-ness is proof it is not pure consciousness.\\n\\nReality is nondual, it\\'s not perceivable unless you\\'re using a mind to have transactions but the mind will limit you to a perspective of reality that is from the point of view of the mind. Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing. This disqualifies it\\'s classification of being nihilistic. Since nihilism has a \"no point\" sort of feel, and in Vedanta we believe existence is the point. Vedanta adds meaning to life, it doesn\\'t remove it.', 'What you said isn\\'t true for just Advaita Vedanta, it is true for all of Vedanta. The point that \"whatever I do is a barrier for moksha\". While it is true that the perception of \"being the only conscious being\" is not exactly the best way to word Advaita, still what you said is shared by all schools of Vedanta. \\n\\nI was going to give you a detailed answer backed up from Bhagavad Gita. But, Vashishta Muni already has answered this question when teaching Bhagavan Sri Rama. Hence it seems best that he should answer your doubt as well directly. \\n\\n[Refutation of Fatalism - Yoga Vashishta](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/yoga-vasistha-english/d/doc118039.html)\\n\\nYou can read the preceding 5 chapters to get an understanding of the basis for it if you wish. This would have the answer though. \\n\\n\\n\\nJai Sita Rama', 'Knowing that this is maya or imagined reality through anubhava is only one half of awakening. The other half is the remembrance of who you are.', 'It\\'s a beautiful question, the questioner\\'s mind has popped out of the closed box mindset, it lets me guess. Because if the question was asking for parallels between Buddhism(shoonyavad) and nihilism it would just be an ordinary philosophy class question.\\nBut the fact that the two, Advaita Vedanta and Nihilism might have some parallel, even such confusion is an insight.\\nAnd I would like to consider them one by one, so to start with Advaita Vedanta, I would like to quote a phrase from Adi Shankaracharya, \\n\"Brahman Satya Jagat Mithya, Jeevo Brahmaiv Na Parah.\"\\nThis translates to Brahman alone is real, the universe(or world) is unreal, and the individual self is no other than Brahman itself(the supreme self).\\nFor nihilism, I would like to define it as the following \"extreme scepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real existence.\"\\nSo the common thing between them is the negative value ascribed to the existence. \\nBut nihilism only ends there and has no other conclusion to draw from this fact.\\nWhile Advaita Vedanta, though says the world is unreal, but it has a conclusion, or an assertion to make regarding the reality of the individual. So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings. This is ego, made possible by mind and the senses, powered by intellect. \\n\\nThere are two ways I can describe our situation-\\n\\nA. Video game  \\nB. Dream\\n\\nIn all this \\'video game\\' we are a part of, we often forget ourselves, playing hours and hours (lives), initially remembering ourselves, but just for fun. Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives. He stabs you in the chest and you see that another person was watching impassively neither helping you nor the other guy. Now you wake up. Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan. You and the countless others before you and after you are the same, parts of dream of Vishnu. Now, you might think, why should I suffer for his Leela? He ain\\'t paying my emi nor helping me deal with office politics. But remember, in your dreams of fear and pleasure, everything was in your head, you imagined juvenile things with your latest crush or saving the world with iron man. They are not true, but your perspective in dream know it. The ego won\\'t allow that. And that leads to all the \"suffering\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>It also terrifies me to think that under all the layers of personality I think of as \"me\", there is really just a single consciousness, the same in everyone. \\n\\nWhy would \"you\" feel terrified when \"you\" in your thoughts and feelings, insecurities and securities, the physical and mental manifestation is but a dream?

Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes. This then to us regular ppl appears as someone having a really really sh\\\\*tty life full of misery, suffering, etc. SO Karma indeed is the answer but there are nuances within that as well.', \"4. The creature experiencing the evil is an incarnation of God, taking on the pain for some reason that will be known later.\\n\\nExample: the Ramayana\\n\\nAlso, I don't really consider 2 or 3 to be reasons for evil to exist. They are just incidental side effects of 1: Karma.\", \"I would argue that a omnibenevelant God would do bad in the interest of good by helping us grow through suffering. As demonstrated by yin and yan, there is good in bad and bad in good. So I would extend your reincarnation point to growth within a single life, as well as over multiple life times.\\n\\nThe point of good and evil being illusionary is interesting. I understand its called illusionary as we as humans conceptualise everything and as we do our definitions are out of touch with the way things are, it's not actually saying that these things don't exist. This teaching is only calling for a deeper understanding into reality, such as, can evil be classed as inheriently bad if its nessesary for good to exist?\", \"I've never heard of this 'well known' argument.

This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe). It is more like Kashmir Shaivism and other similar traditions.\", \"Advaita Vedanta is a beautifully rich tradition, but I fear it often becomes the most popular choice for people (often westerners) who are simply shopping around for interesting philosophies. \\n\\nRemember to ground your understanding in some sort of real practice or Sadhana, otherwise it's just intellectual gymnastics. \", '[deleted]', \">you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ‘you’ stay in this material world and utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' (the impeccably designed video game).

Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality\\n\\nSo literally doing anything at all goes against non-duality? In which case, Shankara who wrote volumes of literature and spent his entire life debating people would also be pretty non-advaitic. You sound like some edgy nihilist who just discovered buddhism.\\n\\n\\nThe brahman maybe formless but it's not some dead and static inertia where literally nothing happens. In kashmiri shaivism, the idea of constant internal movement - spanda - is the defining characteristic of the highest non-dual reality, as it is of the grossest reality.\", 'Jcink Roleplay - Hinduism ElementsIf you don\\'t know - a roleplay on a message board (like Jcink or Proboards) is essentially writing parts of a story with friends online (you write part of it, then a friend will respond and write the next part, and it goes from there, piece by piece). \\n\\nPantheons (Greek/Roman, Norse, just to name a few) are a fun subject to explore with this type of collaborative writing setting.\\n\\n**I had a friend that wanted to make a roleplay but involve the Hindu pantheon in some shape or form (modern day gods on earth, children of the gods, mortals blessed with the god\\'s powers through blessed items, etc.). Besides doing the proper research on who the deities are and the like - what would be the \"safest\" setting for this type of plot that involved the pantheon?** \\n\\nI\\'ve seen people who practice Hinduism be sensitive to the idea of people portraying their pantheon in any kind of written media or say video game media and she wants to make sure she isn\\'t accidentally stepping on the wrong toes with this.\\n\\nShe practices Hinduism herself (not since birth, she stepped away from another religion and has seen herself as a Hindu for only about 2-3 years at this point) so she knows the \"core beliefs\" of Hinduism and the like (but again, this story/plotline would revolve around the Hindu gods). Her train of thought is \"If all these different pantheon have so much attention like Egypt and Norse, why can\\'t Hindu pantheon get some attention/love\"?

Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\n--------\\n\\nThis is a tough question to answer.  The only way I can explain it requires a bit of a philosophical paradigm shift, which is to say I embrace a somewhat Yoga-esque, \"endeavor to enjoy experience without the desire for result\" standpoint.  But that\\'s not an easy answer to accept.\\n\\nI\\'m still researching Dzogchen Buddhism, which seems to closely align with this idea of a dream-like \"un-reality,\" but I\\'m not having much luck so far.\\n\\n---------\\n\\nSo my question (at long last) is this: how can I best explain to someone that an illusory reality, a \"lie,\" is worth taking seriously?  What is the \"point\" of doing anything if reality is really just a dream?', '> \"What is the point,\" they ask, \"if everything is just a dream? Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\nIt makes me wonder:\\n\\nWhat does one gain if it is not a dream, if it is not an illusion? If something is \"just\" a dream, this implies that there is some sort of reality to which \"just\" cannot be applied. What is that? When you scrape this real world, what comes off in your hand? It\\'s more than experiences, so what is it? What is left over that makes this real world more real than the illusory world?\\n\\nIf the problem with the illusory world is that it doesn\\'t have a point, the real one must. What is that, and how does it differ from a set of experiences?', \"One answer is that it will still feel real to you.

', 'your thoughts on the portrayal of Krishna in Shin Megami Tensei IV: ApocalypseI presume most of you aren\\'t familiar with the video game series: shin megami tensei (smt for short). To sum it up it\\'s a long-running jrpg series that is usually set in an apocalyptic setting and revolves around ideological conflict, this includes:\\n\\n1. The law side which fights for order and archives to create a socialist utopia represented by the judeo-christian angels\\n\\n2. It\\'s opposition, the Chaos faction that strives to create a dystopian anarchy so \"only the strong can survive\" and limitless freedom can be accomplished that is represented by the judeo-christian fallen angels/demons\\n\\n3. and the neutral side which denounces both so humanity can follow the best of both sides, which results in it being unstable and suseptable to more ideological wars, and is represented by humans and sometimes even random pagan gods and goddesses.\\n\\nNow, some of you may be familiar to [this little controversy](http://nichegamer.com/2016/02/03/hindus-are-pissed-that-krishna-is-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final/) that happened over a year ago (i\\'m not sure how repeatable the source is, so take it with a grain of salt), which actually inspired me to write this post so i can present what krishna is in-game to those not familiar with it. To begin, i\\'ll just say he\\'s more than just a summonable ally, he plays a major role in the story actually.\\n\\nnow that i\\'ve quickly boiled down the basics of the series, maybe you are wondering what that role in the latest game is. Well, i can\\'t really do this without spoiling the game\\'s plot, but here i go: after he is unsealed he preaches about how yahweh trapped souls into the material realm so they are forced to cling to him via the circle of law-chaos (i could go more into detail, but that\\'d make this post a lot longer than it already is). Krishna\\'s plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy. But no such luck with Krishna, he\\'s simply a forced antagonist who you can\\'t side with.\\n\\nand the last thing i will talk about, the character design: now, [his regular form](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/8/8d/SMT_IV_FINAL_Krishna.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025173647) is a pretty good design personally, and along with being very expressive it does a good job conveying his charming, calm but also snarky and sometimes sarcastic. i\\'m not sure whether i\\'d say \"that\\'s Krishna\" the first time i saw his design, but he definitely feels like krishna when i look at him (at least to me)\\n\\nBut his [vishnu](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_B_SMT4A.jpg) [designs](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_II_SMTIVA_Official_Art.jpg) seem to go more with the forced antagonist role he plays in the story; maybe the design is referencing something i don\\'t know, but with the \"nandakas\" in the second form that really look more like lightsabers, i can\\'t help but to look at vishnu and think \"what is he, a sith lord?\" Kinda discredits him as a god of preservation when his design seems to just say *evil*\\n\\nSo that about wraps it up, but as a note i should say that my goal is not to upset or get anyone offended with this post. i\\'m just curious to see what this community thinks of Krishna\\'s whole portrayal in this game. is it faithful to his origins or not? is this offensive or are these just silly video games that shouldn\\'t be taken seriously?

These are some common questions that people have.\\n\\n1. Why do I need to study the Vedas?\\n2. Is a guru really necessary?\\n3. Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\\n\\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\\n\\n>tadviddhi praṇipātēna paripraśnēna sēvayā |  \\n>  \\n>upadēkṣyanti tē jñānaṁ jñāninastattvadarśinaḥ || 4.34||  \\n>  \\n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus?

I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house. I have come to Hinduism after a long exploration of other religions since my teens. ', \"Hinduism is difficult to understand in few short paras or even book. For example, many hindus will refute your claim about it being polytheistic, stating all those gods/demi-gods etc are just manifestation of one power which is formless and attribute-less (some hindus will claim one god but with attribute and form instead).

Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred. Offer your food to the god you wish to please (offering to Krishna pleases all the gods).\\n\\nReincarnation: Your next vessel is a result of the karma (action) of this life and previous lives. You can overcome reincarnation by returning to Godhead/Krishnaloka/Vaikuntha.\\n\\nThe meaning of life, in my opinion, is to live for Krishna and create a better world for all living entities.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha.

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face.

Maya in simple terms is defined as space, time and causation. All the objective quantities in the universe which we can perceive through our senses and mind (in the form of thoughts, beliefs, etc) all come under Maya. Within maya, one objective quantity can be simplified and explained in terms of other objective quantity.  In particular, all your questions regarding karma are of this type.\\n\\nBut all of maya is just an appearance of the ultimate truth; Atman(which is very loosely translated as soul, whose meaning varies from context to context), which encompasses all the objective happenings in maya. The Atman is not an object, rather, it is that which illumines every objective experience in maya. Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya.

My name is Tirtha. I joined the temple a year ago and my life has completely transformed. Before coming here I was a confused young boy, who had just finished school. I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.). But by the mercy of my teachers, I was able to transform my life and become a better person. Although I have just started my path. I can confidently say that my life is meaningful and it has a deep purpose. I am happy, therefore I want to share this opportunity with others.\\n\\nBrahmacharya is a life of a monk, it\\'s a commitment to restrict oneself from sense gratification, and focus on your spiritual growth. Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek. There is a beautiful lake right next to us and breathtaking waterfalls just a few minutes away. It is a peaceful, quiet, and relaxing environment that is perfect for our spiritual practice.\\n\\nThis is exactly what we are doing in our ashram (temple). We are training young men (from 18 years old) to become strong, responsible individuals in our society. We are studying Vedic scriptures, under the guidance of our teacher Rasik Mohan Prabhu who is a lifelong monk, and who lived in a monastery in India for 16 years of his life. Every day we are practicing yoga and meditation. We also have a lot of service (seva) to do. Our project started only a year and a half ago. We have a lot of things to do and we are also open to new possibilities.\\n\\nWe are also learning many different arts and skills such as yoga, meditation, visualization, construction, painting, building, gardening, book publication, writing, singing, artistic skills, memorizing verses, studying different scriptures, public speaking, and many other things.\\n\\nSo as a resident of the monastery I am inviting every young man who is interested to come and learn how to think like a monk, and most importantly how to live like a monk.\\n\\nIf you are interested or have any questions you can write here or contact me: brotherhoodofmonks@gmail.com\\n\\nNamaste,\\n\\nTirtha', 'Am I correct in understanding that you belong to the gauDIya vaiShNava sampradAya but not to ISKCON?', 'I wish more young people would take up monkhood in a traditional way.', 'Bhagwan Shiva and Bhagwan Ganesha in game , your thoughts , video link in comments', 'Namaste, thank you for the submission.

The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis.

For a time we identify with the roles being played as real characters (when in reality they are just actors).\\n\\nAren't we into the role of our self (lower-case 's') right now and can't we enjoy expansion of that self in love and being free?\", 'Much of this confusion is due to promiscuous usage of language. Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point. Till we attain moksha which is the same as realizing that we are eternally Brahman, the normal rules of morality, human ends, meaning etc all apply. \\n\\nTo give an example, we all know that the world is made of fundamental particles of various kinds. However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels. All this everything is me etc is just a vessel to carry you to the truth and the vessel has to be abandoned one day, too. Like a boat, incredibly useful - to the other side of the river, then you abandon it and walk.\\n\\nWe use a thorn analogy, we use a thorn (advaita vedanta) to remove another thorn (human suffering) and then we discard both.\\n\\nAll this I am consciousness and everyone is me, etc etc will be refined and transformed. There is no I, consciousness is not an I. The I is the ego it\\'s ahaṃkara and consciousness is something completely different. The fact you can see the object of I-ness is proof it is not pure consciousness.\\n\\nReality is nondual, it\\'s not perceivable unless you\\'re using a mind to have transactions but the mind will limit you to a perspective of reality that is from the point of view of the mind. Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing. This disqualifies it\\'s classification of being nihilistic. Since nihilism has a \"no point\" sort of feel, and in Vedanta we believe existence is the point. Vedanta adds meaning to life, it doesn\\'t remove it.', 'What you said isn\\'t true for just Advaita Vedanta, it is true for all of Vedanta. The point that \"whatever I do is a barrier for moksha\".

But, Vashishta Muni already has answered this question when teaching Bhagavan Sri Rama. Hence it seems best that he should answer your doubt as well directly. \\n\\n[Refutation of Fatalism - Yoga Vashishta](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/yoga-vasistha-english/d/doc118039.html)\\n\\nYou can read the preceding 5 chapters to get an understanding of the basis for it if you wish.

Because if the question was asking for parallels between Buddhism(shoonyavad) and nihilism it would just be an ordinary philosophy class question.\\nBut the fact that the two, Advaita Vedanta and Nihilism might have some parallel, even such confusion is an insight.\\nAnd I would like to consider them one by one, so to start with Advaita Vedanta, I would like to quote a phrase from Adi Shankaracharya, \\n\"Brahman Satya Jagat Mithya, Jeevo Brahmaiv Na Parah.\"\\nThis translates to Brahman alone is real, the universe(or world) is unreal, and the individual self is no other than Brahman itself(the supreme self).\\nFor nihilism, I would like to define it as the following \"extreme scepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real existence.\"\\nSo the common thing between them is the negative value ascribed to the existence. \\nBut nihilism only ends there and has no other conclusion to draw from this fact.\\nWhile Advaita Vedanta, though says the world is unreal, but it has a conclusion, or an assertion to make regarding the reality of the individual. So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings. This is ego, made possible by mind and the senses, powered by intellect. \\n\\nThere are two ways I can describe our situation-\\n\\nA. Video game  \\nB. Dream\\n\\nIn all this \\'video game\\' we are a part of, we often forget ourselves, playing hours and hours (lives), initially remembering ourselves, but just for fun. Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives. He stabs you in the chest and you see that another person was watching impassively neither helping you nor the other guy. Now you wake up. Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan. You and the countless others before you and after you are the same, parts of dream of Vishnu. Now, you might think, why should I suffer for his Leela? He ain\\'t paying my emi nor helping me deal with office politics.

Krishna\\'s plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy. But no such luck with Krishna, he\\'s simply a forced antagonist who you can\\'t side with.\\n\\nand the last thing i will talk about, the character design: now, [his regular form](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/8/8d/SMT_IV_FINAL_Krishna.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025173647) is a pretty good design personally, and along with being very expressive it does a good job conveying his charming, calm but also snarky and sometimes sarcastic. i\\'m not sure whether i\\'d say \"that\\'s Krishna\" the first time i saw his design, but he definitely feels like krishna when i look at him (at least to me)\\n\\nBut his [vishnu](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_B_SMT4A.jpg) [designs](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_II_SMTIVA_Official_Art.jpg) seem to go more with the forced antagonist role he plays in the story; maybe the design is referencing something i don\\'t know, but with the \"nandakas\" in the second form that really look more like lightsabers, i can\\'t help but to look at vishnu and think \"what is he, a sith lord?\" Kinda discredits him as a god of preservation when his design seems to just say *evil*\\n\\nSo that about wraps it up, but as a note i should say that my goal is not to upset or get anyone offended with this post. i\\'m just curious to see what this community thinks of Krishna\\'s whole portrayal in this game. is it faithful to his origins or not? is this offensive or are these just silly video games that shouldn\\'t be taken seriously? Are the designs any good or do they just discredit him as a deity? Did you feel like this post was a waste of time or that you discovered something interesting?\\n\\ni also apologize for boasting about the franchise at the beginning and certain parts, but i felt like some context was necessary for proper understanding and i really hope this subreddit\\'s moderators don\\'t ban me from this sub because of that.', \"They are Japanese Video games that should be treated as what they are - Japanese Video games that use world mythology as a backdrop for their plots.

L. Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes. This then to us regular ppl appears as someone having a really really sh\\\\*tty life full of misery, suffering, etc. SO Karma indeed is the answer but there are nuances within that as well.', \"4. The creature experiencing the evil is an incarnation of God, taking on the pain for some reason that will be known later.\\n\\nExample: the Ramayana\\n\\nAlso, I don't really consider 2 or 3 to be reasons for evil to exist. They are just incidental side effects of 1: Karma.\", \"I would argue that a omnibenevelant God would do bad in the interest of good by helping us grow through suffering. As demonstrated by yin and yan, there is good in bad and bad in good. So I would extend your reincarnation point to growth within a single life, as well as over multiple life times.\\n\\nThe point of good and evil being illusionary is interesting. I understand its called illusionary as we as humans conceptualise everything and as we do our definitions are out of touch with the way things are, it's not actually saying that these things don't exist. This teaching is only calling for a deeper understanding into reality, such as, can evil be classed as inheriently bad if its nessesary for good to exist?\", \"I've never heard of this 'well known' argument.

This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe).

I am enchanted.', '[deleted]', 'Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism# Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism\\n\\nsource: paraphrased from several talks by Swami Paramarthananda.\\n\\nThere is a lot of confusion around the necessity and role of Vedas and guru in Hinduism.  These are some common questions that people have.\\n\\n1. Why do I need to study the Vedas?\\n2. Is a guru really necessary?\\n3. Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\\n\\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\\n\\n>tadviddhi praṇipātēna paripraśnēna sēvayā |  \\n>  \\n>upadēkṣyanti tē jñānaṁ jñāninastattvadarśinaḥ || 4.34||  \\n>  \\n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus? How do know that am not a guru?', '[deleted]', 'Very great post, and finding a Guru is one of the most valuable steps a seeker can take.\\n\\nAn important point is to not to treat acceptance of a guru casually and make a quick decision(something which happens a lot these days, sometimes followed by regrets). This is much more important than even something like marriage, and it is not considered good to leave and accept another person as Guru.  The student is usually encourage to spend some time testing and only when convinced at heart,  to commit to someone as Guru and be fully dedicated to their teachings.\\n\\nAlso, we need more guidance about sadhanas that somebody who hasnt yet found their Guru can do, how to find sadhanas which get you close to the Guru principle/tattva,  like Guru Gita, stotras to Dattatreya or Dakshinamurty,', 'Thank you for writing!', 'Indeed satsang (company of learned people) is very helpful.

I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house. I have come to Hinduism after a long exploration of other religions since my teens. ', \"Hinduism is difficult to understand in few short paras or even book. For example, many hindus will refute your claim about it being polytheistic, stating all those gods/demi-gods etc are just manifestation of one power which is formless and attribute-less (some hindus will claim one god but with attribute and form instead).

Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred. Offer your food to the god you wish to please (offering to Krishna pleases all the gods).\\n\\nReincarnation: Your next vessel is a result of the karma (action) of this life and previous lives. You can overcome reincarnation by returning to Godhead/Krishnaloka/Vaikuntha.\\n\\nThe meaning of life, in my opinion, is to live for Krishna and create a better world for all living entities.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha. So end of Mahabharata brings about a change not just in the rulers of Hatinapur but gave a new direction to the entire the then future of India wherein not just a new power  arose to rule but also a different philosophy which was Non-Vedic in nature gained prominence.

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \\n\\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \\n\\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\\n\\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\\n\\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\\n\\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \\n\\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*', '\"you are the universe experiencing itself\"', 'Namaste, thank you for the submission.

The younger people often answered, that virtual creatures are just like a theater or puppet that cannot experience suffering, so there is no karmic consequence of killing virtual creatures in video games.\\n\\nBut some older people answered, that even if they cannot feel any suffering, the act of killing by the people who kill virtual creatures, creates bad karma, because they show no mercy and compassion.\\n\\nI also would guess, that we cannot know, of virtual creatures suffer or not. It could also be, that now that there are virtual existences, beings can be born as a creature in a video game and suffer a thousand times by getting killed by players over and over again.\\n\\nThere are also some differences to theater and films, because the actors just performing a story. In virtual worlds, people kill virtual creatures, to getting more powerful, or gain more reputation, gold or points, which is similar to greed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhat do you think?', \"What about the one doing the killing? \\n\\nAre you excited, proud, distressed, uncomfortable, detached? \\n\\nThe 'suffering' isn't only experienced by the being that is killed.\", 'I think The act of killing virtual characters in of itself wouldn’t generate bad karma, but it would negatively affect your consciousness and endanger you to develop increasing desires to inflict pain and suffering which may culminate in you hurting a fellow jiva.\\n\\nAlso, if your act of killing or otherwise harming a virtual character are witnessed by another and it inspires them to harm others, then I think you’d inherit some bad karma.', \"Killing virtual entities is not a sin imo as they don't have jeeva\", 'It all depends on intention. There is no soul in video game characters. Yet, your intentions comes into play. There is always karma. Your intention creates karma. For example, if someone is rich and looks down on everyone (in his mind) who is poorer than him but he does not act upon it and feels proud within, there is karma even there. Bad thoughts always keep coming into our mind randomly. Thoughts that dominates the mind will cause karma. Try looking at this in the pov of playing a video game and what thoughts are coming in. It’s just my opinion.', 'Virtual killing I would say only creates paap if you want to cause harm to the being', \"I believe it is safe to assume that violence against virtual entities to be similar to violent/aggressive thoughts/feelings to someone else since both don't directly result in real world violence. The following is stated under this assumption:\\n\\nThere are no thought crimes in hindu doctrine of karma so it is not a bad thing directly.  But we hindus believe thoughts and actions mutually reinforce each other by creating impressions in the chitta. Our thoughts prime our behaviour. Unwholesome thoughts prime us/increase the likelihood of us to commit unwholesome actions that would then result in paap.\\n\\nI believe the effect of violent video games on human psyche  is a subject of active academic research. Current research is non conclusive in either direction if I remember correctly. Virtual world might offer an alternate avenue to relieve stress hence making said individual more unlikely to commit real world aggression but this doesn't say anything about if that individual is experiencing an overall uptick in aggressive impulses which he/she then satisfies via more gaming. You can read more about them in their respective websites/articles etc. You can also look into studies that investigate how pornography and the type of pornography affects the psyche and if this is correlated with rape crimes.

None of them has any life into it. \\nYou are just interacting with nothing more than logs of wood.\\n\\nTo define “killing” a living entity must be present and must be defined as the killer; another living being instead will be called the victim. \\nWithout one of these no killing is possible. \\n\\nIt’s how we define killing that shapes the actions and therefore Karma. \\nAssuming a virtual character has life in it is just a mistake based on a “simulated liveness” which of course is nothing more than a mere illusion. \\n\\nPeace.', 'Some models for my Upcoming Game based on Indian gods.

If it is about the experience, there are infinite way a soul can experience difficulties in different ways.

This karma is called prarabdha and it contains both karma with beneficial consequences/phala and those with antagonistic consequences. Depending on the relative ratio - your life would vary from super easy mode to hell difficulty.\\n\\n\\n>4. Is it like a video game? Collect n number of karma to go to swarga, x for vaikuntha etc.?\\n\\nDepends on the denomination. Your good actions doesn\\'t override the bad ones. You go to swarga to enjoy the rewards that weren\\'t adequately rewarded and you go to naraka to get punished for that which were not adequately punished. Another interpretation  is that swarga is life on the world in super easy mode where you get everything for little effort and naraka is life on earth in hell mode where the world is out to screw you.\\n\\n>5. Who decides good or bad karma? Hinduism is not like Christianity or Islam who think that there is an absolute \"good\" and absolute \"evil\".\\n\\nAll actions have consequences. Beneficial vs Antagonistic is more appropriatethan good vs bad in my opinion. Causality doesn\\'t necessarily need an ishvara - so answer varies with denomination \\n\\n\\n>6. How does my karma up till now affect my current life?\\n\\nIt affects by determining the difficulty for every task and prunes the game tree accordingly. Now let us say you want to give an exam - if you have very good prarabdha then you can score 100 by studying the night before exam. If your prarabdha is very negative then you may barely pass by studying very hard throughout the year. \\n\\n\\n>7.

Maya in simple terms is defined as space, time and causation. All the objective quantities in the universe which we can perceive through our senses and mind (in the form of thoughts, beliefs, etc) all come under Maya. Within maya, one objective quantity can be simplified and explained in terms of other objective quantity.  In particular, all your questions regarding karma are of this type.\\n\\nBut all of maya is just an appearance of the ultimate truth; Atman(which is very loosely translated as soul, whose meaning varies from context to context), which encompasses all the objective happenings in maya. The Atman is not an object, rather, it is that which illumines every objective experience in maya. Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya.

Do not pressurise yourself, thinking, \"I NEED TO ACHIEVE ETERNAL PEACE!\" no, no! Peace cannot be achieved in such a manner. Do your work without expecting results, good or bad. When the results come, accept them without hesitation. Enjoy the results, if good, suffer the results, if bad, but do not get attached to them.

It is beyond utility. If you have a taste of this existence beyond purpose, of life beyond sense, you are enlightened. ‘It is possible for us to speculate and create endless stories about why creation happened,’ said the great teacher. ‘If I tell you a story, you can either believe it or disbelieve it.

Don\\'t get me wrong I still love Hinduism and I will follow it till I die because I was born a Hindu. And the other day my mom told me to go to the temple every Tuesday and Saturday.

Good job bro.', 'Always wanted a Ramayana game myself', 'Early access pleaseeeee', 'how Authoritative are Dhramshastras/smrities??Manu Smrti is supposedly told as the work Of the man who calls himself as the patriarch of humans, the Manu. His book mainly deals with how one can apply the concepts of law and order in daily life, personal, social and universal levels. However, the book, as is evident from its inconsistent manuscripts all over India, is not entirely the work of a single self assumed “Manu”, but rather a collective work of creative and stubborn fascists who had but a very strong vision on rule-making and science of administration.\\n\\nBefore we spit out to the Manu and the Brahmins, we must also note that Manu could not have been a single author, and he could not have been a fully racist casteist. Though Manu does appear racist fascist in designating non Aryans outside Aryavarta as barbarians, and casteist through his statements, it is to be noted that only less than 60% of the book is really authentic. And within that, there are internally inconsistent verses. So, in whole, even to this day, one can follow the Manu smrti that suits him, from the collection of verses we have today.\\n\\nSo what does it speak about?\\n\\nContrary to the popular belief, Manu smrti is not about imposing rule in lower castes, but it is a text that really traps Brahmins (which eventually forced Brahmins to manipulate it by adding escape clauses), and makes him not more than a robot, without self opinion or thought or choice of action. Having killed his opportunities and pleasures, the Manu “genersously” gives Brahmin a position highest in the society. (And does not forget to mention that Brahmins should always follow those restrictions) But yea, our later Manus who tampered with the text created verses that finally created an arrogant Brahmin caste in top with immense positions, who could not be questioned, but could dictate anything.\\n\\nManu discusses in detail about the different “Varnashramas” of different castes. The Brahmin’s part is naturally the largest, consisting of restrictions for every breath and movement. Almost four whole chapters are dedicated to restricting, controlling and immobilizing the Brahmin. Manu makes many clauses, some of them directly contradicting, but in the core, Manu wants Brahmin to be simply spiritual, above worldly pleasures, and highly orthodox. Manu, apart from prohibiting meat for Brahmins (somewhere else he also comments that one may eat meat “incidentally” as a leftover of a legitimate animal sacrifice), also prohibits a wide range of foods right from onion, garlic, mushroom… Brahmin is also prohibited to do any jobs other than his Veda teaching, learning, gifting, receiving business. And Manu also considers the following to be highly shameful jobs to a Brahmin (apart from the other “prohibited” jobs of other castes) : astrology, music, dance, doctor… Even Brahmin’s dress code is highly limited - he cannot wear beard if without proportionate hair locks, and even in such cases, the Brahmin with hair locks is not called to many functions like death anniversary feasts. His normal clothing, normal appearance, the attitude everything is predefined. Everything right from breathing (not joking), even eating posture (again, not a joke), walking, doing jobs, when to teach, when to learn, what to not do, how to not live your life, what not to eat, what not to think, what not to wear, where not to live, who should not invited for your parties and feasts, what not to desire, whom to marry, whom not to……\\n\\nNow comes the part of Kshatriya, the king. The Manu unlike the prohibition he made for all Brahmins from worldly pleasures, allows those “pleasures” to the king, but without addiction. However, Manu does create limits to the king and asks him to stay away from certain vices. The king’s laws are there in two chapters, but detailed so as to aid his rule. Personal rules are lesser. The rules of administration are well designed, though our later Manus have had a part in interpolating some “generous” verses into them.\\n\\nThe Vaishya and Shudras have rules separate, only in a single chapter, about 8 rules for Vaishyas and 2 for Shudras. Almost no personal restrictions as a part of their code, but their status much depends on the presence of other castes, the other caste determines the status of how one caste tends to behave.\\n\\nApart from all these personal restrictions to Brahmins in four long chapters (Kshatriyas have only two chaps for them, even when talking about ruling guidelines in detail), Manu supported Brahmins and Brahmanism. Manu does hint about Shramanas, and looks down upon them. The later Manus, through addition of thoughtful verses, made a Brahmin unquestionable. And, it would be silly to blame the initial Manu for all that.\\n\\nApart from the usual laws, Manu also anticipates laws during emergency periods. Here, a convenient relaxation is given in laws.\\n\\nIt is probable that initial Manu envisioned a well divided caste society with more pressure on Brahmins, who but recieved great respect, lesser pressure on King, who deserved respect from all, and almost no pressure on Shudras or Vaishyas. Castes below that have no personal restrictions - they can live their life without “offending” the other castes.\\n\\nAltogether, the Manu Smrti is a well planned, but corrupted text, just like any text post vedic age there are power games which are noticable, we know these inconsistencies come when any \\'religion\\' in power, we know this because we can observe this with Bhuddism and jainism scriptures as well, the moment they become the dominant religion of a region/s they start downplaying the \\'ahimsa\\' principal, we know that no matter the religion the priests which were patronised indulged in religious propaganda on the king\\'s behalf when their king and his ambition in regards to war and conquest grew and then they justified their \\'dharmic\\' war and their practices some of which are abbhorent, this was a practice done by every major religion in india when they were in the dominant position, this point is expanded upon in Upinder Singh\\'s book \"political violence in ancient india\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy point through all this is that given that we know there was power politics and propaganda in these smrities/shastras etc how much weightage do you place on these scriptures, they are not shruties which are the axiomatic texts of hinduism, you don\\'t buy into vedas and hinduism falls appart, that is not the case with smrities, so how much weight do you place on dhramshastras/smriti texts?? should they be read with \\'shraddha\\' and be above criticisms like vedas like manusmrities suggests or should they be subjected to scrutiniy and not be above criticisms??', 'The smriti deals with two kinds of dharma: viśesa dharma (special duties) and sāmānya dharma (common duties). The former pertains to the responsibilities allotted to the individual in the varnāśrama framework while the latter deals with the ethical and moral values that he must adopt.\\n\\nWe learn from the Gītā that varna is determined by svabhāva (nature). In the ancient past, it was possible to distinguish individual varnas by lineage alone owing to the prohibition on varna-sankara. In the modern age, where there is ambiguity regarding lineage, śīlā or character, becomes the identifying marker for varna. For it is written:-\\n\\n>**Mahābhārata Vana Parva, section CLXXIX**\\n\\n>“Men of all the four orders are without restriction constantly begetting children on women of all the varnas. And speech, cohabitation, birth and death of men of all the orders are similar in all respects. It is, on this account, that the wise have asserted that the character (śīlā) is the chief and needful thing.”\\n\\nThe injunctions of the dharmashastras regarding jurisprudence (vyavahāra), custom (ācara) and expiation (prayāschitta) cannot be applied in all circumstances for they operated on the presumption of a janma based varna system which obviously does not exist today. Thus, while the portion of the dharmaśastras pertaining to viśesa dharma is more or less defunct in this day and age, the prescribed sāmānya dharmas (such as ahimsa, āsteya, śauca) still apply.', 'The vedas are considered divine text so they are at the highest level, the other texts like smriti are not divine or authoritative, personally I think they should be ignored', 'Books for Motivation/PassionHello Everyone,\\n\\nRight now I (20M) am in a very competitive college program here in the U.S. and have worked very hard to get here, but recently I have been having a really distracted mind and unfocused on my studies.

How does one know who?This is not to cause division among Hindus so please read till the end.   \\n**Who is the almighty Vishnu or Shiva or Devi?** One has to understand the difference between portraying something as Almighty vs Discriminating against others. **Why not?** Such a description of \"Almighty\" can only be almighty because of the existence of other Non-Almighty entities to prove that.  **Why?** It\\'s like a movie where a Hero can only be a Hero because of the villain. The worse the Villain, the better the hero. This is the approach taken by many sects, **but does it mean the sects are wrong?** **No, I am not saying the Vaishnava sect or the Shaiva sect etc... are wrong,** but it\\'s not how many are portraying it to be. See, all it takes to destroy such an approach is just to prove that hero cannot be a hero without a villain. Or a king is only a king because of the people in the kingdom. If the kingdom is empty then **he is the king of what?** Another question can be asked. If the same almighty God created these non-almighty demigods, then why is the religion not written like the western religions where there is absolutely no doubt who is who and who is not? Why Vedas? Why Darshanas? Why Tantras? Why Itihasas? Any are these non-almighty gods outside the one Almighty God? Or are they within/part of the one Almighty God? If they are part of the Almighty god then that means this almighty god has parts that are non-almighty. It\\'s like saying my body has some cells that are of lesser and insignificant quality, in scientific terms, it\\'s called Cancer. So what are these sects?\\n\\nFor example, Srimad Bhagavatam is one of the pinnacle of Bhakti Puranic literature dedicated to Sri Krishna for Vaishnava. But in that, there is a chapter dedicated to Shiva in which he is addressed as Brahman. In the same Purana, Sri Vishnu calls Trimurti are essentially the same. So there was no need for a Vaishnava literature to say that. Even Prabhupad said that \"Sri Vishnu and SadaShiva are the same\" but only in one instance, but I will not go deep into them.\\n\\nNow take Devi Bhagavatam: Though it\\'s a pinnacle for Bhuvaneshwari, the highest order of sustenance is given to Sri Maha Vishnu than Shiva. They didn\\'t have to do that.\\n\\nNow go back to Itihasas: Both Shankara and Krishna are called Rudras. And Narayana says I am in the heart of Rudra and Rudra is my heart and those who make distinctions are fools.\\n\\nNow go back to great saints: TulasiDas who is a staunch devotee of Rama wrote Rama Charitramanas first gave salutations to Vani and Ganesha and also composed Rudrastakam (inhered from Ṛṣi Lomasa), why?   \\nBhartruhari a staunch devotee of Shiva said \"I do not see any fundamental difference between Shiva the Overlord of the universe, or Vishnu the Inner Soul of the universe. But still, my affection is for the one who has a crescent moon on his head\"\\n\\nVedic Rishis didn\\'t fight with each other in the Vedas claiming Vishnu is supreme to Shiva or Indra. Kenopnishad says \"Indra then recognized that Uma the daughter of the mountains is that Brahman\". Each sect was designed to emulate the Iconified version of Supremacy as the highest Pinnacle or as the whole. It\\'s done so for the purpose of Sādhanā (a focused approach to rising in consciousness, without distractions of other schools).  Only a few ignoramuses for whom devotions have not reached their hearts but reached their ego center play the supremacy games. Rest are engrossed in Sādhanā. Yet if you honestly want to get supremacy it\\'s better to join the Vishnava Group.', 'I am going to stick to the God and parts of God thing. Others can answer rest if they want.\\n\\nGod is the only cause. Both material, and efficient. Which means, whatever exists is made from and by God. God is cause, everything else is effect.

I’ve just spent a lot of time researching the community and things relating to it for purposes of creating the document I am working on because anecdotal evidence from ex shifters and my research has pointed towards the shifting mindset being harmful to one’s mental state, specifically regarding dissociation and related issues.\\n\\nI’m working on a research document and a specific part of it needed a viewpoint I could not provide, as I do not practice Hinduism- if reality shifting was actually a Hindu practice. I made a post identical to this one on the r/Buddhism subreddit as well, since it is also used to support the shifting belief system.\\n\\nFor those unaware, Reality Shifting (also called Shifting, quantum jumping, moving realities, etc.) is a HUGE community built around the idea that by using certain ‘methods’ you can move your subconscious to another reality and live out a totally new life, or that you can become aware of your already existing consciousness in another reality. Stereotypically it’s used by kids and teenagers to shift to Harry Potter and date the characters (specifically Draco) but it goes deeper than that, and many people use shifting as a way to live multiple lives with all of their favorite characters in their favorite shows/movies/anime/games/etc. Shifters tend to talk about ‘the multiverse theory’ (usually broadly or using the Many Worlds Interpretation) and use that to prove that shifting and all of these fictional worlds are real and that when they use their methods, they actually go there/become aware of their subconscious there.\\n\\nShifters tend to cite Hinduism and ‘ancient Hindu practices’ (with no elaboration) as proof that shifting is real and not just something that rose to popularity during the 2020 lockdowns on tiktok. However, I’ve yet to find any connection between shifting and Hinduism, so I thought I’d ask here. Is reality shifting or something similar part of Hinduism? How do you feel about these people using Hinduism as a way to back up their claims?', 'It sounds like they could be taking some concepts from Hinduism and misapplying them. What you are describing sounds like trying to be lost in Maya, or illusion. Can there be many realities, according to Hinduism?

I\\'ve had always wanted to, but was afraid that it would have been dismissed off as \"ridiculous\". My takeaway is since concepts like this are almost always discussed \"implicitly\"(i mean the idea of jumping realities, NOT other manifestation techniques, as the latter is discussed pretty explicitly in the Shrutis, as another commenter pointed out w quotes)  in scriptures, the only way to find an accurate answer is an in-depth reading of the Shrutis (a class of hindu scriptures, which mainly deals w philosophies, ie the Vedas and the Upanishads).\\n\\nIf you do find an answer in r /Buddhism or r /Jainism , then i\\'m sure you can trace it bk to hinduism as well since these two religions are among the offshoots of Hinduism.', \"Different realms or realities?

This is a very sick approach. Why? It\\'s like a movie where a Hero can only be a Hero because of the villain. The worse the Villain the better the hero. This is the approach taken by many. All it takes to destroy such an approach is just to prove that hero cannot be a hero without a villain. Or a king is only a king because of the people in the kingdom.

Today both Agama and Nigama are mixed like water and concrete. Only hand full of these agamic schools exists and are very secluded and hidden from popularity. Go and sit with these 6 Śākhās, spend time with them, serve them, and learn from them. Learn grammar (Vyakaranam) and get initiated. Chant and learn for 14 years.

The colloquial identification of the self and body is due to coordinative predication, which is called samAnyAdhikaranam in Sanskrit Grammar.\\n\\nThis means that the body is treated as a prakara or mode of the self, and during the time when they are associated together, i.e., the individual is alive, one can speak of the individual (body + soul) as one unit. \\n\\nIf the individual is named John, this name can be associated with the body without any error as long as John is alive, but technically, John is the name of the consciousness that inhabits John\\'s body.\\n\\nOnce John is dead, it would be incongrous (though still accepted in common parlance) to associate any name or label to the mortal remains.\\n\\nThus, as long as body and soul are associated, any property, name or label possessed by the soul is transferred without any error onto the associated body. This is the principle of SharirAtmabhava that was the bedrock of scriptural interpretation used by Swami Ramanuja and his followers. \\n\\nUsing this principle, they were able to provide a consistent framework for interpreting the entire body shruti vAkyAs, those that taught bhEda, those that taught abhEda, and those that taught a reconciliation or ghataka between the two. In contrast, Dvaita ( viz. Advaita) has to provide a justification at the outset why Bheda ( viz. Abheda) shrutis must necessarily be the correct ones to interpret.\\n\\nNow coming to your question, Ishwara is \"in\" the bad people in the sense that Ishwara pervades their soul the same way their soul pervades the body. The karma of the bad people affects their realisation of this fact, and in their ignorance, they literally identify themselves with their gross body. The karma only affects their body and soul, but not Ishwara. The soul is affected by experiencing the fruits of its actions in this birth and next. The body is affected by actual suffering it undergoes when associated with the soul.\\n\\nIshwara is unaffected. This is the statement of the parable of two birds in the Chandogya.\\n\\nAn important corollary of Ishwara being unaffected is that he bestows free will on the Jivatmas while being the absolute master of all. He expects Jivas to seek Him of their own free will. This also means Jivas have the potential to do evil. And this is reflective of their karma rather than His will. That this free will exists is stated clearly in the Brahma Sutras, and this disposes of the problem of Evil for the Vedantin.\\n\\nAnother important corollary is that any glory of the Jivatma is a vibhuti of Ishwara, the same way that the name John that is incorrectly assigned to the body us actually the name of the soul. Similarly, any imperfections pf the conduct of the Jivatma is a product of its karma and not Ishwara\\'s will, similar to how any physical imperfections of John do not affect his soul.', 'Although demons were created by God, their purpose is to represent the adversity to overcome on the path to Enlightenment.

The idea that everything is an illusion comes from a very basic yet fundamental misunderstanding of Advaita. The different planes of existence and manifestations are not fundamentally 'true', which means that they are not beyond the realms of time, space and causation. The reality or truth is not held by the helms of time, space and causation, so from the perspective of reality, the transactional plane is mithya. But mithya does not mean false in the sense that it does not exist, it just means that it is an appearance, a limited manifestation in the helms of time, space and causation and is hence not the essential reality of things. So your very premise of the question is wrong. Of course ishvara and other deities are important in Hinduism since they are not an illusion, and neither is creation an illusion.

People come from all walks of life and from all kinds of circumstances, and approaching Hinduism purely from a spiritual standpoint is perfectly okay as a starting point. \\n\\nHowever, this stage gradually matures into the realisation that spirituality and religion are not enemies, and in fact, go hand in hand. \\n\\nImagine a building. The interiors of the building, all its various floors, right from the ground apartments to the terrace, correspond to sprituality. However, the interiors are supported by the external framework of the building, the most important part being the underground pillars and networks supporting the entire outer structure.\\n\\nThe underground pillars are the Vedas. The outer structure is itihasa and puranas. And the internal apartments in the building is sprituality, the essential teachings of religion. \\n\\nIt is impossible to ultimately be spiritual without being religious. You can have a building without apartments inside, but you can't have apartments inside without a building outside. Similarly, you can be religious without understanding its deeper teachings of spirituality, but you cannot be spiritual without being religious.\\n\\nMy basic point is this, spirituality is the epitome of religion, is the ultimate truth that religion is designed to impart to you. You cannot jump ahead directly to the truths of life without undergoing the necessary stages of development. The stages being the understanding of the scriptures, devotion for all forms of God, service to others. I've seen many people, especially in the philosophy I myself follow, that of advaita vedanta, claiming that they don't believe in God and that they are not religious. Hinduism doesn't need atheists in disguise.\\n\\nJust yesterday I saw a post on some spiritual subreddit which said 'I have opened my third eye, ask me anything.' I mean, are you serious? Have we reduced the chakras and other divine and extremely deep aspects of spirituality into some sort of game and a way of seeking validation and moral superiority and promoting pseudoscience?\\n\\nI have got into altercations with the orthodox religious people here too in the past who consider the words of the scriptures as words of God because of philosophical differences, but at least they were genuine to their philosophy and practice and were not hypocrites unlike the 'Spiritual but not religious people'. They simply see religion in a bad light and are too afraid to admit it.\\n\\nAgain, if you find yourself falling into this category, don't take this as an attack on you, but rather as an invitation to study religion deeply and with an open mind. If spirituality was simple and could be accessed directly, there would've been no need for religion in the first place.\\n\\n Orthodox religious systems are important and necessary, and while remaining stuck there and being attached to it due to identity politics is harmful, it is a necessary starting point. You need to walk into the building through the entrance, and can only then take the elevator to the topmost floor. You can't directly land on the terrace, it's called wishful thinking and lying to yourself. I'm talking to you, Advaita Vedanta. And yeah, I'm saying this as an Advaitin myself. Advaita is contaminated with these covert atheists.\", \"As I have progressed in my understanding of the many concepts and methods comprising Vedic traditions, I become more in tune with these scriptural deities, who have built some kind of temple inside my head, and they provide for me. Worship of them had always been out of respect, curiosity, enjoyment, never really knowing they would give back to me in their special ways. It's sensitivity.\\n\\nI was desensitized as a child, I think. Probably for good reason, this world is a harsh environment energetically speaking. Yoga and meditation initiated the process, but the deities, understanding them, interacting with their intelligence, opens channels within me that I have no idea how to do without those connections to the specific deity that provides, say, pain relief, as one deity does for me. When I chant to Her, it feels like cheating. Years of 🧘\\u200d♀️ yoga can't compete. But one yoga deepens into another.\\n\\nBut it has taken years to create enough inner awareness of my senses and body, mind and ego, to begin to extrapolate the essence of many practices which require, more than anything, faith, which means not quitting. For many years chanting and devotional practices really didn't produce anything tangible, and felt sometimes a bit silly, maybe. But having given the effort over time, invested, *dividends* were an unexpected grace I had no idea existed.\", \"I agree. I always  considered myself  spiritual and just had no faith that fit until I found  Hinduism.  I studied and continue to learn and reasurch religion. I think religious understanding and knowledge is essential for spirituality but I also don't believe you need to find your personal religion to be spiritual.  \\n\\nI believe that the understanding of religion can bring spirituality but from  my experience it is a hollow feeling on an intellectual level until you find the right one for you.\", 'Spirituality is the belief,  religion is the structure.\\n\\nIt is only humanity that demands the labels.', 'And what if religion fights with Sprituality instead of supporting it? Sprituality is capable enough to stand on its foot, it does not need religion.', \"Fair warning, I might not be the most educated on the topic but here's my take: being 'not religious' and being atheistic aren't always the same thing. \\n\\nFor those Hindus who focus on the concept of Brahman as the Absolute consciousness, the way they relate to it is quite different from the way you might relate to a name-and-form deity. They might not pray to Brahman. They might not ask for favours, or tell their stories, or seek grace or forgiveness, or practice rituals to propitiate Brahman. For them, realising that they and Brahman are one and the same is the only goal of their seeking. \\n\\nPeople who match the above description might not identify as religious, because their relationship with the divine is so different from the prevalent Bhakti-inspired orthodox religious practices around them.\\n\\nThat said, those who believe in Brahman, an Absolute consciousness, are not atheists. Atheists believe that consciousness is born from matter and dies with matter - if their brain loses its physical form, they will cease to exist. Also, they don't believe that the universe has any fundamental consciousness or principle that human beings will ever be capable of understanding. Both of these are ideas that any Advaitin will reject, whether they consider themselves religious or not.\\n\\n**Edit**: Not that I consider Bhakti to be an inferior way to reach the divine - I personally find bhakti and worship to be a less abstract and more effective way to connect with spirituality. But it's not the only alternative to atheism.\", 'Bro, you changed??', 'I don’t mean this as an attack but as a completely sincere question: aren’t you sort of doing the same thing as those you accuse by saying “orthodox religious systems” are just a stepping stone and sticking to them is harmful?', \"Isn't religion just organized spirituality?

I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.).

Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek. There is a beautiful lake right next to us and breathtaking waterfalls just a few minutes away. It is a peaceful, quiet, and relaxing environment that is perfect for our spiritual practice.\\n\\nThis is exactly what we are doing in our ashram (temple). We are training young men (from 18 years old) to become strong, responsible individuals in our society. We are studying Vedic scriptures, under the guidance of our teacher Rasik Mohan Prabhu who is a lifelong monk, and who lived in a monastery in India for 16 years of his life. Every day we are practicing yoga and meditation. We also have a lot of service (seva) to do. Our project started only a year and a half ago.

The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis.

On a simplistic level, the Bhakti yogi is less likely to question things as the jnana yogi is to accept things as is. \\n\\nAre these two things opposed to the other? What does reconciliation of these two really mean, does it mean you give up on one of the paths ?

We take the emigrant in our shelter from sixty thousand and ninety enemies whose conveyances are twenty camels and she camels, whose loftiness of position touches the heaven and lowers it\". Read Muhammad\\'s(uwbp) history of emigration to medina and see this prophecy being fulfilled. No Hindu explanation of this exists as to my knowledge. [Atharva Veda 20:129]\\xa0', 'These are claims found on Zakir Naik’s website and they have been debunked extensively in forums like Hindustackexchange.\\n\\nNow I would give Zakir Naik a thousand dollars if he can name the difference between a Samhita, a Brahmana, an Aranyaka and an Upanishad, as well the structure of each school of Vedic recension.', 'No. He is not mentioned in the Vedas whatsoever.\\n\\nI mean they’re not even prophetic texts so why would he even by mentioned', 'Lose that \"friend\".', 'First things first, this seems to be based on claims made by Dr. Zakir Naik, who no one can reasonably claim to be an expert on Hindu shastras. Second, the references mentioned in the way they are are nonsensical. It would be very difficult to find the verses he is alluding to using those references. So first it is imperative to provide the original verse in sanskrit to make any reasonable debate regarding this matter.\\n\\nNow let\\'s dive into the points laid out here. For the first two points, the same reference is given, which is not traceable using the structure of the reference given. The point asserts that the verses were mistranslated/misunderstood. With the scripture being so old, and so many commentaries having been written on it, and many debates having happened, and many interpretations having been extracted, not once have any of the great thinkers and philosophers of Hinduism made this claim of an Ahmed in that verse, or else it would be something that we would be hearing about much more.\\n\\nNow let\\'s address the third point. The reference given does not say that. The english translation by Ralph T. H. Griffith says this: \"These our libations, strength inspiring Soma draughts, gladdened thee in the fight with Vritra, Hero-Lord, What time thou slewest for the singer with trimmed grass ten thousand Vritras, thou resistless in thy might.\" And if you read the rest of that hymn, then you will realize that his understanding of the verse is a faulty abstraction due to baseless knowledge of sanskrit.\\n\\nNow let\\'s address the fourth point. The Rigveda reference given does not prophesize Muhammad. The word is Sushravas, not sushrama. Sushravas was a king, and he is the subject matter of the verse. The english translation of this reference by Ralph T. H. Griffith is as follows: \"With all-outstripping chariot-wheel, O Indra, thou far-famed, hast overthrown the twice ten Kings of men, With sixty thousand nine-and-ninety followers, who came in arms to fight with friendless Susravas.\" Here he is again putting his own definition into the word and drawing a conclusion that is way off-course.\\n\\nNow the final point. Once again we have a faulty reference in which he does not even mention the name of the purana he is referencing. Nonetheless, he is referencing the Bhavishya Puran. It\\'s important to know the structure of the Bhavishya Puran and the problems it has. Being thought of as a prophetic shastra, many people have added to it over the years to make it seem that certain things were foretold a long time ago. Wikipedia explicitly says, \"The \"prophecy\"-related third part Pratisargaparvan includes sections on Christianity, Islam, Bhakti movement, Sikhism, Sultanate history, Mughal history, British rule, and others. This part is considered by scholars as a 18th– to 19th-century creation.\" giving reference to scholarly articles. So to say that the verses mentioned are canon is nonsense.\\n\\nOne more point to make is that articles similar to this also mention that there is an Allopanishad (Allah-Upanishad). But the list of the 108 official Upanishads does not mention this and is considered to be a creation of the Mughal Era. Dayanand Saraswati does not consider it an Upanishad as it does not exist in the Atharvaveda (from which it is claimed to be, or any of the other Vedas). So that argument is baseless as well.\\n\\nSo, please fact check before believing nonsense like this. Even fact checking it a little, following the references to make sure they hold up, goes a long way, and would be helpful. Posing the question here is beneficial to many, but it causes unnecessary dialogue. Nonetheless thank you for coming here to find your answer.', 'Dude atleast ask for the source written in sanskrit.\\n\\nDesert cult retards think anywhere \"अहम्\" is written it could be interpreted as Ahmed.', \"These sort of textual tampering attempts happen within the sects of Hinduism as well.\\n\\nEven a supposed Advaitin, in a discussion from a few months back, tried to equate the Abrahamic understanding of God to that of Brahman, right here in this sub.

These are some common questions that people have.\\n\\n1. Why do I need to study the Vedas?\\n2. Is a guru really necessary?\\n3. Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\\n\\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\\n\\n>tadviddhi praṇipātēna paripraśnēna sēvayā |  \\n>  \\n>upadēkṣyanti tē jñānaṁ jñāninastattvadarśinaḥ || 4.34||  \\n>  \\n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus? How do know that am not a guru?', '[deleted]', 'Very great post, and finding a Guru is one of the most valuable steps a seeker can take.\\n\\nAn important point is to not to treat acceptance of a guru casually and make a quick decision(something which happens a lot these days, sometimes followed by regrets). This is much more important than even something like marriage, and it is not considered good to leave and accept another person as Guru.  The student is usually encourage to spend some time testing and only when convinced at heart,  to commit to someone as Guru and be fully dedicated to their teachings.\\n\\nAlso, we need more guidance about sadhanas that somebody who hasnt yet found their Guru can do, how to find sadhanas which get you close to the Guru principle/tattva,  like Guru Gita, stotras to Dattatreya or Dakshinamurty,', 'Thank you for writing!', 'Indeed satsang (company of learned people) is very helpful.

And there Karna put up with Drona, for the purpose of learning arms.And that powerful youth contracted a friendship with Duryodhana. And having acquired all the four kinds of weapons from Drona, Kripa, and Rama, he became famous in the world as a mighty bowman. And after having contracted a friendship with Dhritarashtra\\'s son, he became intent on injuring the sons of Pritha\" - Mahabharata Adi Parva CCCVII. \\n\\nTruth - Then when was he rejected by Drona? \\n\\n\"Karna. one day approached Drona in private and said these words unto him, \\'I desire to be acquainted with the\\xa0Brahma\\xa0weapon, with all its\\xa0mantras\\xa0and the power of withdrawing it, for I desire to fight Arjuna......Thus addressed by him, Drona, from partiality for Phalguna, as also from his knowledge of the wickedness of Karna, said, \\'None but a Brahmana, who has duly observed all vows, should be acquainted with the\\xa0Brahma\\xa0weapon, or a Kshatriya that has practised austere penances, and no other.\\'\" - Mahabharata Santi Parva Section II\\n\\nSo he was rejected when he asked for Brahmastra. And the reason is clear - he asked it in order to fight Arjuna. He is jealous and also Drona was partial to Arjuna (and his son) so he rejects. It is then that he goes to Parasurama and lies that he is Brahmin, possibly also because Drona said only Brahmin and Kshatriya that have observed all vows can learn. We must remember that it is only Arjuna that reached the highest extent, hence proving that austerity, humbleness, service to preceptor are most important qualities to obtain higher knowledge. \\n\\n(2) Karna met Duryodhana for the first time in Rangbhoomi - The above passage answers this. He knew Duryodhana from Gurukul days itself. Moreover he was involved in the poisoning of Bhima. His enmity with Pandavas started from Gurukul days not from Rangbhoomi. \\n\\n(3) Karna tried to prevent Cheerharan - No, he was the one who started it. \\n\\n\"And at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by anger, waving his well-shaped arms, said these words,--\\'O Vikarna, many opposite and inconsistent conditions are noticeable in this assembly... Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the attire of Draupadi.\" - Mahabharata Adi Parva Section LXVII\\n\\n(4) Karna was rejected by Draupadi in Swayamvar - Actually only few editions, like 4 out of 1000, mention this. It\\'s an interpolation. Even the editions that mention that he was rejected, later when Dhrishtadyumna is wondering who can win the contest now that powerful kings have failed thinks \"Shalya and Karna both failed how can anyone else win?\", Clearly showing inconsistency. \\n\\nThe BORI critical edition , made after researching different versions, omits the part where she rejects him. Even Sri Madhvacharya boldly declared in 13th century itself that Mahabharata is interpolated heavily and then wrote Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya. Here he too writes that Karna missed the target and later Arjuna wins it - no mention of rejection of Karna by anyone. So on strength of Acharya\\'s words and also research we know it\\'s a later insertion. \\n\\n(5) Draupadi insulted Duryodhana as blind son of blind man - this is not in any edition. This is just from BR Chopra serial. \\n\\nThe Sanskrit version doesn\\'t really mention her specifically. Neither does Bhagavatam, it just says the ladies laughed. Andhra Mahabharatam and some other versions says the Pandavas laughed and then Draupadi and other ladies also laughed. But it\\'s just laughing which was quite natural, seeing everyone was doing that and it was indeed funny. It wasn\\'t mean-spirited, Duryodhana was too proud and hence he took it in wrong light. \\n\\nSerial wanted to spice up matters by adding a dialogue like that, but it maligned her character as a haughty woman. \\n\\n(6) Draupadi was a haughty woman - She is the one who forgives the killer of her sons Aswatthama and asks Pandavas to spare him, so no way. There is no instance where she is proud at all. \\n\\n(7) Ghatotkacha was a noble and virtuous person - This is because of folk tales. Indeed he did help out the Pandavas and Draupadi during their exile, and he served his father and stepmother well. \\n\\nYes Bhagavan Krishna was the only one cheerful when he died and also one reason was so that Arjuna is saved from Karna\\'s Vasava Shakti. But the other reason He mentions,\\n\\n\"If Karna had not slain him with his dart in great battle, I myself would have had to slay Bhima\\'s son Ghatotkacha. From desire of benefiting you, I did not slay him before. That Rakshasa was inimical to Brahmanas and sacrifices. Because he was a destroyer of sacrifices and of a sinful soul, therefore hath he been thus slain. O sinless one, by that act as a means, the dart given by Sakra, hath also been rendered futile. O son of Pandu, they that are destroyers of righteousness are all slayable by me. Even that is the vow made by me, for establishing righteousness. Whither the\\xa0Vedas\\xa0and truth and self-restraint and purity and righteousness and modesty and prosperity and wisdom and forgiveness are always to be met with, thither I myself always remain.\" - Mahabharata Drona Parva Section CLXXXI\\n\\n(8) Krishna is just a man in Mahabharata except for Gita, Bhagavatam made Him a God. \\n\\nThis is the most laughable myth. Because every stanza of Mahabharata describes Him as God! I\\'ll just give one but literally there are innumerous references. In Ramayana itself there are so many references to Sri Rama\\'s divinity but in Mahabharata there are many many more. \\n\\nTwo main ones. Bhishma declares this in entire Sabha of all the kings of India and front of Devas also during Rajasuya Yajna. And Markandeya Rishi who personally met Bhagavan Narayana tells Yuddhishtira about Narayana and at the end says \"The Krishna you have with you now is that same Narayana \" and instructs him to worship Him. \\n\\nEven Duryodhana knew. Dhritarashtra is told this and that no one can win over Krishna. So he gets fearful and tells Duryodhana to stop fighting but Duryodhana says that he knows all this and that he can\\'t win but that still he needs to, he can\\'t stop himself, the anger against Pandavas is too great. Then Dhritarashtra curses his fate. \\n\\nThese are it for now! Doubts about any other incidents? Let me know! \\n\\nAdditional -\\n\\n(1)  Pandavas went to hell and Duryodhana went to heaven - that is just a vision. Why would Pandavas, the close friends of Krishna, go to hell? Krishna, who is declared as \"krishnam dharmam sanatanam\"? \\n\\nThe various abodes they reached are described in Mahabharata. Arjuna reaches Vaikuntha and is shown to be sporting with Krishna there. So no Pandavas did not go to hell. The Swarga Duryodhana went to is temporary as the Gita declares, it\\'s not a permanent abode of bliss like Vaikuntha. \\n\\n(2) Shakuni was motivated by revenge - Interesting tale but no factual basis. It is not mentioned in Mahabharata, \\n\\n\"the chaste Gandhari hearing that Dhritarashtra was blind and that her parents had consented to marry her to him, from love and respect for her future husband, blindfolded her own eyes.\\n\\nSakuni, the son of Suvala, bringing unto the Kurus his sister endued with youth and beauty, formally gave her away unto Dhritarashtra. And Gandhari was received with great respect and the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp under Bhishma\\'s directions. And the heroic Sakuni, after having bestowed his sister along with many valuable robes, and having received Bhishma\\'s adorations, returned to his own city.\"\\n\\n- Mahabharata Adi Parva Section CX. \\n\\nShakuni\\'s brothers are killed in Kurukshetra by the Pandavas, so no way they all died in a dungeon. He just loved his nephew and hence supported him. \\n\\n(3) Shakuni was a master strategist and rivalled only by Krishna, he planned everything - I don\\'t recall any instance where he really did that much. I can only remember him driving the game of dice forward but otherwise it was mostly Karna and Duryodhana taking decisions. Shakuni seems to be the most moral out of the \"evil 4\" in fact. \\n\\nNeither does he seem like a master genius anywhere, he was definitely a master dice player and was smart . But  his intelligence is overblown. I don\\'t recall any super genius plan of his, and definitely Mahabharata is not just a chess game between Krishna and Shakuni like people think. He was nowhere near Krishna. \\n\\nAdmittedly I can\\'t recall other genius plans, I\\'d like to know if there is any story that shows Shakuni plotting. \\n\\n(4) Arjuna hated Karna - The rivalry was more one-sided. Karna wanted to prove himself as the best warrior and better than Arjuna. Narada Muni says that there aren\\'t warriors that can beat Arjuna and Karna implying that they are the best, hence Karna wanted to prove himself better than Arjuna and built up hatred and jealousy for that reason from schooldays itself. \\n\\nBut Arjuna did not really hate Karna. He was indifferent. He only focused on bettering his skills. When Bhima takes the vow that Arjuna shall kill Karna in Kurukshetra after Vastraharana is probably when his anger starts. Even then it\\'s not such an intense feeling from his side - he definitely is angry at Karna but the intense rivalry is more from Karna\\'s side.\\n \\n(5) Krishna is a morally gray character - No, in fact He and Vyasa Mahamuni (I would add Vidura too) are the whitest characters morally. It is known to everyone that where there is Dharma, there is Krishna and that where there is Krishna there is Dharma. Hence even the Kauravas showed respect before the war. Krishna was immensely respected and it was known that He is always, always on the side of Dharma. \\n\\nNot once did He transgress morality or the words of the scriptures, in fact when He is reviving Parikshith one of the statements He says is \"If I have never told a lie, let this child be revived\" . So definitely He never lied. \\n\\n(6) Krishna is bound by Karma, that is why He could not escape Gandhari\\'s curse - Krishna is free to do whatever He wants. Not just Him, no jnani is bound by Karma, He declares this emphatically in the Bhagavad Gita which is found in Mahabharata. Second, it is not that He can\\'t escape Gandhari\\'s curse - \"Krishna suffered it to take place although he was fully competent to baffle it. Govinda was able to alter the very course of the universe with all its mobile and immobile creatures. What need then be said of the curse of even high-souled Brahmanas? \" - Veda Vyasa Mahamuni says this in Mausala Parva Section VIII. \\n\\n\\n\\nJai Sita Rama', 'This needs to be pinned.\\n\\n\\nPlease add your insights on Duryodhan and Shakuni that you previously shared in my question a few months ago.\\n\\n\\nI recently discovered that Shakuni asks Duryodhan to stop obsessing, to which Duryodhan threatens to commit suicide (emotional blackmail) to enlist Shakuni.\\n\\nJai Shri Ram!', 'very informative. thanks.', 'Mahabharat is history of India. There are no myths. It’s not a mythology', \"This is great. I would like to add.\\n\\nWhen the laughing at duryodhana episode happens, acharya madhva writes that Krishna started laughing first, then bhima, then draupadi and everyone else.

How to administer a kingdom that large and how to spread dharma. In this council all the kings, Krishna, narada and other great people were attending. *Duryodhana, who got a formal royal invitation, staggered in drunk out of his mind and late.* He also slipped and fell because he couldn't even walk properly because of the intoxication. The reason krishna laughed was to bring an end to him.\\n\\narjuna never talked about killing karna till he took part in the disrobing of draupadi. Arjuna got the various astras from Drona because he had won over the negative faculties and had conquered himself. krishna loved him because of that. Karna wanted the astras to be in the good graces of duryodhana and to be the one to kill arjuna. In fact, the sadhana of arjuna for the role had started before his being born as arjuna. The gandiva bow wielding boon, he had done tapas before and gotten it. Arjuna is indra himself with avesha of nara form of krishna.

That is 'worry' samadhi. There is no cognition of surroundings, just a blank stare. Or we might be engrossed in a book, caught up in a game, or intently watch a movie.

Dhyana and samadhi aren't possible with external objects because they keep changing. When the dharana is put to the truth, then it intensifies into dhyana and culminates in samadhi. Dharana is basically where there is you and your object of concentration. Dhyana is where there is no you, only the object of concentration. Concentration has now deepened into meditation. And samadhi is where even the object of concentration is not there. Only the distilled truth remains. This isn't possible with normal objects of the world, it requires some divine support such as the ishta devata. The point is not to concentrate the mind in selfish pursuits, but rather concentrate the mind on a universal truth or symbol of the truth like Om or the ishta devata. This concentration is not like the narrow minded and focused concentration of playing a game or reading a book, but is a very broad and encompassing concentration where you are concentrating on everything at once, per se, because you're concentrating on the symbolism of consciousness itself. And consciousness precedes all movement of mind. Hence, what you're describing is dharana. Where there is you and you focus on something.

Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point. Till we attain moksha which is the same as realizing that we are eternally Brahman, the normal rules of morality, human ends, meaning etc all apply. \\n\\nTo give an example, we all know that the world is made of fundamental particles of various kinds. However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels. All this everything is me etc is just a vessel to carry you to the truth and the vessel has to be abandoned one day, too. Like a boat, incredibly useful - to the other side of the river, then you abandon it and walk.\\n\\nWe use a thorn analogy, we use a thorn (advaita vedanta) to remove another thorn (human suffering) and then we discard both.\\n\\nAll this I am consciousness and everyone is me, etc etc will be refined and transformed. There is no I, consciousness is not an I. The I is the ego it\\'s ahaṃkara and consciousness is something completely different. The fact you can see the object of I-ness is proof it is not pure consciousness.\\n\\nReality is nondual, it\\'s not perceivable unless you\\'re using a mind to have transactions but the mind will limit you to a perspective of reality that is from the point of view of the mind. Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing. This disqualifies it\\'s classification of being nihilistic. Since nihilism has a \"no point\" sort of feel, and in Vedanta we believe existence is the point. Vedanta adds meaning to life, it doesn\\'t remove it.', 'What you said isn\\'t true for just Advaita Vedanta, it is true for all of Vedanta. The point that \"whatever I do is a barrier for moksha\". While it is true that the perception of \"being the only conscious being\" is not exactly the best way to word Advaita, still what you said is shared by all schools of Vedanta. \\n\\nI was going to give you a detailed answer backed up from Bhagavad Gita. But, Vashishta Muni already has answered this question when teaching Bhagavan Sri Rama. Hence it seems best that he should answer your doubt as well directly. \\n\\n[Refutation of Fatalism - Yoga Vashishta](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/yoga-vasistha-english/d/doc118039.html)\\n\\nYou can read the preceding 5 chapters to get an understanding of the basis for it if you wish.

Because if the question was asking for parallels between Buddhism(shoonyavad) and nihilism it would just be an ordinary philosophy class question.\\nBut the fact that the two, Advaita Vedanta and Nihilism might have some parallel, even such confusion is an insight.\\nAnd I would like to consider them one by one, so to start with Advaita Vedanta, I would like to quote a phrase from Adi Shankaracharya, \\n\"Brahman Satya Jagat Mithya, Jeevo Brahmaiv Na Parah.\"\\nThis translates to Brahman alone is real, the universe(or world) is unreal, and the individual self is no other than Brahman itself(the supreme self).\\nFor nihilism, I would like to define it as the following \"extreme scepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real existence.\"\\nSo the common thing between them is the negative value ascribed to the existence. \\nBut nihilism only ends there and has no other conclusion to draw from this fact.\\nWhile Advaita Vedanta, though says the world is unreal, but it has a conclusion, or an assertion to make regarding the reality of the individual. So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings. This is ego, made possible by mind and the senses, powered by intellect. \\n\\nThere are two ways I can describe our situation-\\n\\nA. Video game  \\nB. Dream\\n\\nIn all this \\'video game\\' we are a part of, we often forget ourselves, playing hours and hours (lives), initially remembering ourselves, but just for fun. Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives. He stabs you in the chest and you see that another person was watching impassively neither helping you nor the other guy. Now you wake up. Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan. You and the countless others before you and after you are the same, parts of dream of Vishnu. Now, you might think, why should I suffer for his Leela? He ain\\'t paying my emi nor helping me deal with office politics. But remember, in your dreams of fear and pleasure, everything was in your head, you imagined juvenile things with your latest crush or saving the world with iron man.

(And they refer to God/Bhagavant as “him”, like a personalized concept, not an abstract one.)\\n\\nDo Hindus actually talk about “God” in that way, and do they use the word “Bhagavant” for him?

Bhishma, the grandfather of the Kurus, having heard this, sent messengers unto the king of Gandhara. King Suvala at first hesitated on account of the blindness of the bridegroom, but taking into consideration the blood of the Kurus, their fame and behaviour, he gave his virtuous daughter unto Dhritarashtra and the chaste Gandhari hearing that Dhritarashtra was blind and that her parents had consented to marry her to him, from love and respect for her future husband, blindfolded her own eyes.\\n\\nSakuni, the son of Suvala, bringing unto the Kurus his sister endued with youth and beauty, formally gave her away unto Dhritarashtra. And Gandhari was received with great respect and the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp under Bhishma\\'s directions. And the heroic Sakuni, after having bestowed his sister along with many valuable robes, and having received Bhishma\\'s adorations, returned to his own city. And, O thou of Bharata\\'s race, the beautiful Gandhari gratified all the Kurus by her behaviour and respectful attentions.

Given that you're talking about mass destruction and what-not, that could potentially be understood in that light - destruction is not necessarily a bad thing, not at all, but rather a catalyst for transformation and new growth.

My perspective of Hinduism (You're allowed to have it). The whole universe is divine incl. us and all the intergalactic dust. Every atom recycles itself into something all the time in this universe. So it applies to one's soul(if you believe in soul anyway), it recycles once the carrying body is dead. So rebirth. The divine Brahman's body is all the matter in the universe and it's soul is God(conscience). Just like our body is a part of our universe, our soul is part of the collective conscience. Each soul has individuality and in order to reach God, it should have 0 net karma. These are all my own understanding and may not agree with popular theories. Also since you are talking about space, you can use the above theory that every soul reincarnate to fulfil their Dharma(which is acheive 0 karma). But if the carrier planet(Earth) is destroyed, the souls which has to be reincarnated will reincarnate in other planets with life. Intergalactic Hinduism.

He never asked for any wish or boon from Sri Krishna. When Krishna was at the verge of completing His Avatar, he called Uddhava and said,‘ Dear Uddhava, in this avatar of mine, many people have asked and received boons from me; but you never asked me anything. Why don’t you ask something now? I will give you. Let me complete this avatar with the satisfaction of doing something good for you also.’  \\n>  \\n>Even though Uddhava did not ask anything for himself, he had been observing Krishna from his childhood. He had always wondered about the apparent disconnect between Krishna’s teachings and actions, and wanted to understand the reasons for the same. He asked Krishna, ‘Lord, you taught us to live in one way, but you lived in a different way. In the drama of Mahabharat, in the role you played, in your actions, I did not understand many things. I am curious to understand the reasons for your actions. Would you fulfil my desire to know?’  \\n>  \\n>Krishna said, ‘Uddhava, what I told Arjuna during the war of Kurukshetra was Bhagavad Gita. Today, my responses to you would be known as ‘Uddhava Gita’. That is why I gave this opportunity to you. Please ask without hesitation.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava starts asking – ‘Krishna, first tell me who is a real friend?’  \\n>  \\n>Krishna says, ‘The real friend is one who comes to the help of his friend in need even without being called.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava: ‘Krishna, you were a dear friend of the Pandavas. They trusted you fully as Apadhbhandava (protector from all difficulties). Krishna, you not only know what is happening, but you know what is going to happen. You are a great gyani. Just now you gave the definition of a true, close friend. Then why did you not act as per that definition. Why did you not stop Dharmaraj (Yudhishtra) from playing the gambling game? Ok, you did not do it; why did you not turn the luck in favour of Dharmaraj, by which you would have ensured that dharma wins. You did not do that also. You could have at least saved Dharmaraj by stopping the game after he lost his wealth, country and himself. You could have released him from the punishment for gambling. Or, you could have entered the hall when he started betting his brothers. You did not do that either. At least when Duryodhana tempted Dharmaraj by offering to return everything lost if he betted Draupadi (who always brought good fortune to Pandavas), you could have intervened and with your divine power you could have made the dices roll in a way that is favorable to Dharmaraj. Instead, you intervened only when Draupadi almost lost her modesty and now you claim that you gave clothes and saved Draupadi’s modesty; how can you even claim this – after her being dragged into the hall by a man and disrobed in front of so many people, what modesty is left for a woman? What have you saved? Only when you help a person at the time of crisis, can you be called ‘Apadhbandhava’. If you did not help in the time of crisis, what is the use? Is it Dharma?’  \\n>  \\n>As Uddhava posed these questions, tears started rolling from his eyes.  \\n>  \\n>These are not the questions of Uddhava alone. All of us who have read Mahabharata have these questions. On behalf of us, Uddhava had already asked Krishna.  \\n>  \\n>Bhagavan Krishna laughed. ‘Dear Uddhava, the law of this world is: ‘only the one who has Viveka (intelligence through discrimination), wins’. While Duryodhana had Viveka, Dharmaraj lacked it. That is why Dharmaraj lost.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava was lost and confused. Krishna continues ‘While Duryodhana had lots of money and wealth to gamble, he did not know how to play the game of dice. That is why he used his Uncle Shakuni to play the game while he betted. That is Viveka. Dharmaraj also could have thought similarly and offered that I, his cousin, would play on his behalf. If Shakuni and I had played the game of dice, who do you think would have won? Can he roll the numbers I am calling or would I roll the numbers he is asking. Forget this. I can forgive the fact that he forgot to include me in the game. But, without viveka, he did another blunder. He prayed that I should not come to the hall as he did not want me to know that through ill-fate he was compelled to play this game. He tied me with his prayers and did not allow me to get into the hall; I was just outside the hall waiting for someone to call me through their prayers. Even when Bheema, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva were lost, they were only cursing Duryodhana and brooding over their fate; they forgot to call me. Even Draupadi did not call me when Dusshasan held her hair and dragged her to fulfil his brother’s order. She was also arguing in the hall, based on her own abilities. She never called me. Finally good sense prevailed; when Dusshasan started disrobing her, she gave up depending on her own strength, and started shouting ‘Hari, Hari, Abhayam Krishna, Abhayam’ and shouted for me. Only then I got an opportunity to save her modesty. I reached as soon as I was called. I saved her modesty. What is my mistake in this situation?’  \\n>  \\n>‘Wonderful explanation, Kanha, I am impressed. However, I am not deceived. Can I ask you another question’, says Uddhava. Krishna gives him the permission to proceed.  \\n>  \\n>‘Does it mean that you will come only when you are called! Will you not come on your own to help people in crisis, to establish justice?’, asks Uddhava.  \\n>  \\n>Krishna smiles, ‘Uddhava, in this life everyone’s life proceeds based on their own Karma. I don’t run it; I don’t interfere in it. I am only a ‘witness’. I stand close to you and keep observing whatever is happening. This is God’s Dharma.’  \\n>  \\n>‘Wow, very good Krishna. In that case, you will stand close to us, observe all our evil acts; as we keep committing more and more sins, you will keep watching us.

We've got some great reviews coming in and I thought of sharing this with the community to get your thoughts and feedback as well.

You will go head-to-head with your opponent, spending valor (a finite resource) to dispatch warriors to the front-line to not only deal damage but also defend your life.\\n\\nAs in the ancient myths, each warrior has a chosen weapon, which when paired together award bonus powers. Divine scrolls, inspired by interesting characters and stories from the Hindu myths, award you with powerful bonus skills, extra valor, and deadly force to help you take down your opponent.\\n\\nMaha Yodha features exquisite traditional Indian artwork, or Pattachitra, as well as specially commissioned illustrations of celebrated warriors and weapons in a really modern style that is getting a lot of appreciation from reviewers.\\n\\nIf you're interested to see the campaign, go here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leprechaungames/maha-yodha-an-epic-new-card-game-4000-years-in-the\\n\\nThanks for reading!\\n\\nedit: We've just updated our campaign with a major change which should be of interest to you all!

(Actually, grandparenting) My wife and I were in Madurai Meenakshi temple a few years back. After taking darshan, we found a quiet spot to sit and watch, over in a corner back behind the Siva sanctum. (We are never in a hurry on such pilgrimages, preferring to take time to take it all in.) So eventually along comes an older man with his bright little granddaughter in tow. Obviously the two of them have come to the temple for some outing. She\\'s dressed for temple. As they approach us, her eyes get bigger as we sort of stand out, being white. It may be the first time she\\'s seen a white pair of devotees in traditional garb like we wear. As they get closer  it\\'s obvious she\\'s really curious. So I say, \"You speak English?\" \\n\\nLo and behold she does ... fluently.  The Granddad also does but not as well. But his years of experience allow him to shut up and let her talk. And she does, as do we. We discuss her favorite God, her favorite part of the temple, how often she comes, her family and why she come on Fridays with Appappa. She asks us where we\\'re from, how we became Hindu, what we think of India, and more. I\\'m guessing it\\'s half an hour or so. But the really impressive thing was the ability to parent by the man ... the patience, the smiles at watching his dear granddaughter and the opportunity. \\n\\nAnd it could have been so much worse. He could have tugged her away.\\n\\nAum', \"That's one of the most wholesome things I have read today. I appreciate the way you communicated with her, I'm sure she will remember that conversation throughout her life and would remember you forever! \\n\\nBy the way, what's your favorite God?

In America we often see so much seperation between traditional Hindus and converts, it's wonderful too see in the Holy Lands that people from different places in the world understand, love and be interested in each other's relationship with God and his Host.\\n\\nLord Shiva is our father, Lady Parvati is our mother, the disciples of Him are our family and all of the three worlds are our home!\", \"What's wrong with tugging her away?

It seems that if the world is just a game/joke/play, and people are an expression of Brahman all playing their various roles and getting lost in their act, then it would be difficult to be empathetic because none of it is serious, fundamentally. If someone is deeply lost in their role, it’s just a superb ability to lose one’s nature in the play.\\n\\nI have never studied Hinduism so my understanding of these concepts could be incorrect.

In fairness, most of my concepts line up with Hindu concepts; but I don\\'t think that\\'s conclusive.\\n\\nThere was a Shakta (Goddess-worshipper) named Ramakrishna who performed a couple of bold experiments. He embraced Islam, then came back and announced that Islam was also a way to God and resumed worshiping Kali. He then had an experience of Jesus, announced that Christianity was also a way to God and resumed worshiping Kali. But he had this to say about Jesus: that, not only was He an Avatar; He was \"the Redeemer of the world.\" And he honored Jesus to the end of his days.\\n\\nI think the truth is a lot stranger than we are often willing to acknowledge. Formal religion is all about theology and self-discipline; and these things have value, don\\'t get me wrong. But, fundamentally, religion is about knowing God; and God won\\'t be put in a box, no matter how hard we try.\\n\\nI come from a Christian background and upbringing. I have not considered myself Christian since 1993; yet I have never denied the divinity of Jesus. I have simply gone a different path. For myself, I find Ramakrishna\\'s testimony compelling. I think Jesus is special -- that there is something about Him, His life and His sacrifice that stands alone. That doesn\\'t mean I\\'m going to believe everything that is hung on him, like ornaments are hung on a Christmas tree; people hang ornaments on Christmas trees to please themselves, but the tree is the tree.\\n\\nI include Jesus in my personal pantheon; and Lalita doesn\\'t seem to care. I would go further on this, but not publicly. In any case, I wouldn\\'t worry. Love God, however you conceive of Her; the rest will take care of itself. :)\\n\\nEDIT: I forgot to mention something. Pope John Paul II -- an amazing guy, IMHO -- said (regarding Christians, of course) that it was possible to participate in Jesus\\' substitutionary atonement, i.e. for a Christian to suffer for another\\'s sins. Don\\'t you think that\\'s amazing? To have the opportunity to participate in the redemption of the world?\\n\\nI have read, in Hindu literature, that it is not possible to take on the karma of another person; but I think that\\'s wrong. I feel sure of it. Love breaks all the rules, and what is love but the total gift of self to another. I think that, if anything, is the defining characteristic of God: that She gives of Herself, constantly and completely. I think we were created in order for Her to have others to give Herself to. How can we not give our whole selves to others? We are all One, ultimately. Can we not suffer for others?

Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes. This then to us regular ppl appears as someone having a really really sh\\\\*tty life full of misery, suffering, etc. SO Karma indeed is the answer but there are nuances within that as well.', \"4. The creature experiencing the evil is an incarnation of God, taking on the pain for some reason that will be known later.\\n\\nExample: the Ramayana\\n\\nAlso, I don't really consider 2 or 3 to be reasons for evil to exist. They are just incidental side effects of 1: Karma.\", \"I would argue that a omnibenevelant God would do bad in the interest of good by helping us grow through suffering. As demonstrated by yin and yan, there is good in bad and bad in good. So I would extend your reincarnation point to growth within a single life, as well as over multiple life times.\\n\\nThe point of good and evil being illusionary is interesting. I understand its called illusionary as we as humans conceptualise everything and as we do our definitions are out of touch with the way things are, it's not actually saying that these things don't exist. This teaching is only calling for a deeper understanding into reality, such as, can evil be classed as inheriently bad if its nessesary for good to exist?\", \"I've never heard of this 'well known' argument. Shucks darn. Mystics don't argue.\", ',hank you for posting.', 'A DETAILED ARTICLE BY MAANOJ RAKHIT ON HINDU CASTE SYSTEM&#x200B;\\n\\n**The basics before you proceed**\\n\\nThere is something you may want to understand well before you proceed any further. If your slate/page is full you won\\'t have any place to write on it until you clean it up well. Similarly, your mind, your thoughts, your emotions —almost your whole being—is covered with a blanket. This blanket is made of primarily three components - your religion, your education system and media around you. Using (or abusing) the Media (the immensely powerful tool that it is) you are constantly being bombarded with what you *should know*. These *invisible shackles* are too demanding to let you lose. \\n\\nYou may think that you are free to form your independent opinion—almost about anything—but the truth happens to be otherwise. You are also constantly reminded that you are making an informed choice but the reality is opposite. You never realize that you are always being fed with selective information. Your religious guides tell you what they want you to know. Much the same is the case with your educators and your media. Your psyche formation —right from your childhood through adolescence to the adulthood—takes place under their guidance. And, my objective is to break that cordon of cultivated misinformation, and the resultant ignorance.\\n\\nWhen an Untruth is repeated thousand times it begins to sound like truth. When it is repeated hundreds of thousands of time it becomes The Truth, and the real truth becomes the Untruth. Your school textbooks are the best tool to achieve this fate. From the very childhood your brains are washed thoroughly leading you to a make believe world of which you have no direct experience because it relates to that Past where \"you\" were not Present!\\n\\nYour direct experiences of today (if any) are projected as the direct outcome of that remote past of which you have no true experience, except whatever you may have been told via your textbooks, your religious guides, and media stories. Guides of organized religions have their own agenda that itself guides their thought and action, and based on that they guide the thoughts and actions of their followers. Contents of educational textbooks and media coverage get widely influenced by the images that their religious guides have helped them form over generations. If there remains any question of doubt it is duly taken care of by those who control things from behind the scene, the very support system which regulates breathing of educational institutions and media outlets (that is the inflow of finances and the power centers). \\n\\nThe repetition which has carefully shaped the untruth as truth can only be neutralized by equal amount of repetition. And therefore, you must not frown upon any repetition in my works, though they are often not verbatim repetitions. You may as well enjoy reading them. 25-10-2007\\n\\n**On gross social injustice in form of caste system**\\n\\nSome of you may have read *Seed-2* and some of you may not have. I receive plenty of feedback from my readers and I know that most often people do not get on hand the first book first. They get at random one of the books from someone and start reading it. It simply does not happen that they have access to all my works so that they can read them sequentially. Hence, those who have not read *Seed-2*, for them, the following section will be helpful. And for those who may have read *Seed-2*, for them, it may serve as recapitulation. Some arguments may be common with *Seed-2* and some not—to support the same case a different logic may have been used.\\n\\n*When you think of Caste system you think of gross social injustice towards a very large section of Hindu society. And Hindu Braahman is said to be the main culprit behind this injustice. This theory has been so well propagated that people today simply find no need to apply their mind. Just like any other superstition or blind faith they believe in this theory. Whenever any such propaganda driven theory is popularized with purpose, there is always some hidden beneficiary. Who all were those—that I have discussed elsewhere—I wouldn’t want to get sidetracked here—so let us stick to the point.* \\n\\nHindu society’s foundation was based on 4-Varn System: Braahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shoodr Varn. 16th century Christian missionaries coined a new term for this: Caste system. 19th century fiercely-Christian T B Macaulay introduced Christian Missionary driven English Education System by systematically eliminating Ancient Hindu Education System in BhaaratVarsh. Christian educators slowly poisoned the minds of unsuspecting Hindu children against Braahmans. 20th century Nehru dynasty pampered Marxist-fake-Secularist educators who continued the process with greater enthusiasm. Education system, newspapers, magazines, cinema, every possible media was used. With continued repetition every one came to believe that Hindu society practiced gross social injustice in the name of Caste system. Now look at these documented testimonies that give you a totally opposite picture. These testimonies were carefully kept out of your view for long, though they existed all along! You must read them and ask yourself a question— \\n\\n*Can the foundation of Hindu society be based on gross social injustice when ‘justice and truthfulness’ has been the lifeblood of the Hindu Society through the ages?*\\n\\nMax Muller filled 37 pages with examples of Hindu Justice and Hindu love for Truth and he said that he could go on quoting many-many more. To top it he titled the chapter as *Truthful Character of the Hindus* in his book *INDIA what can it teach us?* He categorically stated (p.50): \"Now, it is quite true that during the two thousand years which precede the time of Mahmud of Gazni, BhaaratVarsh has had but (\\\\*not) few foreign visitors, and few foreign critics; *still it is extremely strange that whenever,* either in Greek, or in Chinese, or in Persian, or in Arab writings, *we meet any attempts at* describing the distinguishing features in the national character of the Indians (\\\\*Hindus), regard for truth and justice *should always be mentioned first*.\"\\n\\nHe goes on to state (p.59): \"I have left to the last of the witness who might otherwise have been suspected—I mean the Hindus themselves. The whole of their literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth.\" \\n\\n*Now tell me—do you think a society could have all along practiced gross social injustice towards its own people, a society whose whole literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth?*\\n\\nAnd why does he say \"I have left to the last of the witness who might otherwise have been suspected\"? He knew that his audience (ICS aspirants at Cambridge University in England 1882) would think these were for talk not for practice. *Therefore, he cited numerous facts based on Hindu life style and conducts before he moved to Hindu literature so that his audience realizes that the teachings of Hinduism were truly reflected in the conduct of the Hindus—and that is the real test—the speech and action must corroborate, or else, it’s fake.*\\n\\nBefore Christ was born, 5th Century, Greek physician Ktesias dedicated in his works a special chapter on Justice of the Hindus. *Hindu Justice could not have been exemplary to Greeks if Hindu social structure was truly based on a system of gross social injustice towards the vast majority of its own people.* *This is nothing but plain logic and you do not need vast degree of intelligence to understand it.* Nevertheless, let us proceed with (a) what other observers documented about the Hindu society over a period as large as two thousand and four hundred years and (b) *witness the kind of consistency those documentations reflect at.* \\n\\nBefore Christ was born, 4th Century, Greek Ambassador Megasthenes spoke of Hindu love for Truth and that no Hindu was a slave. *Now tell me, how is it that Megasthenes documented in 4th century BC that \"no Hindu was a slave\" in a society that is supposed to have practiced gross social injustice in form of infamous Caste system?* \\n\\nAfter Christ was born, 2nd Century, Greek Arrian the pupil of Epictetus said Hindus were never accused of lying. 7th Century Chinese Hiouen-thsang spoke of Hindu Straightforward Honesty and Never Unjust nature. *How is it that a society, accused of practicing gross social injustice towards its own people, has been praised by Hiouen-thsang putting it on record ‘with regard to justice, Hindus make even excessive concessions’?* \\n\\n11th Century Muslim Conqueror spoke of Hindu Justice, Good Faith, Honesty and Fidelity. *Once again, it has been said that ‘Hindus were naturally inclined to justice and never depart from it in their actions’. How could they have allowed social injustice of the kind they were accused of by Christian educators and Communist educators?* Ever wonder if they were educators by profession or professional liars? *What was their objective? Did they want Hindu children to get cut off from their mainstream religious and cultural base and begin to look for alternative with (a) Christianity in ChristianBritish days (b) with Communism/Marxism in so-called post-independence days?*\\n\\n13th Century Italian Marco Polo spoke of **Hindu Braahmans** as the most Truthful, for they would not tell a lie for anything on earth! *Now ask yourself, who have been lying all along? These people from different origins, from different centuries, who came and visited Hindus and came to invariably the same conclusion? Or, Christian missionaries who had the hidden agenda to convert Hindus into Christianity by hook or crook? Or, Communist-Marxist historians of AMU and JNU who had a hidden agenda to spread their wings so they could keep their illegitimately acquired hold over Hindu society?* All fraudsters have a brotherhood kind of feeling and they support each other. This is what these Christians and Communists had been doing but simpleton Hindus did not see through their foul play. Wake up my Hindu nation and try to understand their game plan. \\n\\nOn the other hand, only three centuries later, the Saint of Christianity named Francis Xavier of 16th century (we will soon see what other people of 16th century have to say) calls Hindu Braahmans as perverse, wicked and crafty men and terms all Hindus as unholy race (Seed-5). Such happens to be the character of a Saint of Christianity. So, you can well imagine what would be the character of the lesser ones than a Saint. *When their ulterior motives are not otherwise fulfilled, they resort to tarnishing the image of others, and in doing so they reveal their own ‘wicked and crafty nature’.* The same applies to the ChristianEnglish educated ChristianizedHindus, and CommunistMarxist thinkers who adopted such questionable methods to raise their own social status by fraudulently reducing others. And, on that premise they built their imaginary theory of so-called **Oppressive Braahmanism** so that they could discredit the Braahmans, and occupy their coveted position in the Hindu society which these characters were not worthy of. Using (rather abusing) their hold over administrative machinery and educational system, they filled Hindu children’s minds with the filth that the Braahmans practiced much despised caste system and untouchability to retain their own superiority and their hold over Hindu society. *In the process, they not only* *tarnished the image of Braahmans in Hindu society, but effectively persecuted Hinduism itself on a much wider scale.* Their motive was simple: convert the Hindus into Christians. Communists followed the lead and used the same technique. Their motive was equally simple: convert the Hindus into Communists/Marxists. \\n\\n13th Century Muslims spoke of Hindus Free of all deceit, violence and fear of death. *And, Hindu Braahmans have been accused by Christians and Communists for deceit and violence in form of gross social injustice!* The foundation on which the Christians and the Communists built their propaganda was the **imaginary** theory of Aryan Invasion (Seed-2) and establishment of so-called (imaginary) oppressive Braahmanism. *This in itself was a fraud against humanity, and deceit of high order. This crooked theory has caused immense harm to the humanity.* \\n\\n14th Century Friar Jordanus speaks of Hindus True in Speech and Eminent in Justice. *But same Hindus are accused of gross social injustice by our Christian educators and Marxist intellectuals.* Must you continue to respect these liars who committed social fraud on you? *Ask Hindus, ask yourself. Don’t you owe at least, that much to yourself?* How long do you wish to live under the spell of these crooks that taught you nothing but lie?\\n\\n15th Century Persian Ambassador spoke of Perfect Security that Merchants enjoyed in our country. *Hindu Kshatriyas fulfilled their duty not only towards their own people but also towards foreign traders and an average Hindu fulfilled his duty towards the society at large.* And, what have these crooks given you now after destroying the social fabric of Hindu society? \\n\\n16th Century Muslim Minister Abul Fazl spoke of Hindu Truthfulness, gratefulness, and unbounded Fidelity and Never flies from Battlefield type character. *This was true of every Hindu Kshatriya—when he left for the battle field his mother would tell him that \"the day has arrived for which Kshatraanis (Kshatriya women) breast fed their milk to their children and the time has come to repay that debt!\"* And, what these Christian educators have taught you all along, that, Hindus were so much divided all the time that they could not face the Muslims. Besides, lowering your self-esteem what else have they given you? Have they given you the knowledge that has benefited you, or have they cheated on you while maintaining a poker face all the while? 19th Century common Muslims spoke of Hindu Straightforwardness. Do you find any trace of straightforwardness in these Christian and Marxist educators? Why do you still continue to let them remain your educators? \\n\\nMax Muller compares legendary Hindu honesty with English and French, and finds it superior to the Europeans. He also mentioned that he can go on quoting book after book and you will find that no one ever accused Hindus of falsehood. *Think, my dear fellows, think, can the Truthfulness of this magnitude survive in a society allegedly ridden with social injustice? Or, the allegation itself has been fraudulent, and a fabrication with ulterior motive?* We will deal with those motives, in detail, in our other books. You will see from historical evidence that historical frauds have been so common with Christianity from its very inception that it has become the second nature of Christianity. 18th century Warren Hastings \\\\[India’s First Governor General 1774-1784\\\\] spoke of Hindus as Less prompted to Vengeance for Wrong Inflicted than any people on the face of the earth. This is probably the reason that Hindus continue to tolerate these fraudsters, who have perpetrated social fraud of such magnitude that they have destroyed a great civilization that lasted thousands of years until these crooks arrived on the scene. Expect me not to use better adjectives for them—they should be identified as they have been and as they are. Bishop Heber spoke of Hindus as more easily affected by kindness and attention to their wants and feelings than any people he ever met with. *This is probably the reason that Hindus respected Christianity looking at handful of honest Christians like these counted few.* \\n\\nElphinstone spoke of Hindus about their freedom from gross debauchery. *People who live a life of purity, they do not indulge into the kind of gross social injustice they have been accused of,* by Christian educators and communist educators. \\n\\nSir Thomas Munro, the eminent Governor of Madras, spoke that Hindus were not inferior to the nations of Europe and he was convinced that England had more to gain if Civilization became an article for trade between BhaaratVarsh and England. *Do you think Sir Thomas Munro would have said something like this if our Hindu society were ridden with social injustice of the kind these Christian and Marxist educators have told us, and told the world?* \\n\\nProf. Wilson spoke of better quality of Hindu Honesty at Calcutta Mint than other mints elsewhere in the world. *Do you think that the people who cannot have any social justice within their social framework can have people commonly as honest as indicated here?* \\n\\nProf. Wilson spoke of **Braahman Simplicity truly Childish**. *Do you think that these Braahmans could have been credited with such childish simplicity if they happened to be such dirty people, who were alleged to have created this treacherous caste system for their own benefit?* Look at the statement (see *Seed-5 Christianity in a different Light—Face behind the Mask*) of St. Xavier, which painted Braahmans as perverse and wicked. Look at his reason, which he himself described to the Society of Jesus. *Xavier could not convert many Hindus into Christianity. His ulterior motive was hurt. So, he painted Braahmans in such bad light. His successors did the same thing. Later day missionary educated Hindus parroted what their teachers had taught them. Realize that you have learned the falsehood from your Christian educators and you have spread that falsehood further through television serials, movies, newspapers, etc. Now you must stop and reverse that process, which you too are responsible to some extent but only as the pawns in the hands of those master conspirators, who fooled you and cheated you all along.* If anyone is to be despised, it is not **Braahmans** but these cheats called Christian educators and Communist-Marxist educators.\\n\\nColonel Sleeman has put on record that he had before him hundreds of cases, in which a man’s property, liberty, and life depended upon his telling a lie, and he refused to tell it. Max Muller then asks: Can many an English judge say the same? *Could our so-called wretched caste system and a socially unjust society have produced such truthful Hindus incomparable elsewhere?* Do you realize the significance of this sentence: Can many an English judge say the same? *By deductive logic, if the outcome was so great, then the foundation also had to be equally great. And, that foundation was the 4-Varn System.* People with vested interest speak against it. People of ignorance keep parroting the same. Today, if we do not see any trace of such legendary truthfulness amongst Hindus, it is because these Hindus have become Christianized-Hindus, under the very bad influence of six generation of English-Christian Education System, which Macaulay instituted as he wanted to Christianize the Hindus. \\n\\nMax Muller says that for past two thousand years Greeks, Chinese, Persian, Arabs, all described the most distinguishing feature of Hindu society as its regard for truth and justice, *but for two hundred years English-Christian education system taught Hindus that the most distinguishing feature of Hindu society was its social injustice in form of 4-Varn System, which they renamed as caste system.* Were these Christian educationists lying all along? *Was their lie part of a much bigger conspiracy against Hindu society? Was it to bleed Hindu society to death?* \\n\\nEnglish Merchants spoke that commercial Honor stood higher in India (BhaaratVarsh) than in any other country. Why we do not see any evidence of it today? *Is it because Christian educators have completely ruined the sense of ethics amongst Hindus? Educators, who themselves posses no ethics, what else can they pass on to their pupil?* *If they themselves were not truthful, then how could you expect to learn anything about justice from them?* \\n\\nYou must understand this basic fact: *if the foundation is* *based on fraud, its outcome will also be fraud. In this context, English-Christian education system’s foundation was based on fraud against Hindu society. Their purpose was ignoble. Their intentions were conspiratorial. There was simply no regard for truth and justice in their belief system. Therefore, they produced crops like themselves. Students of their education system, through next six generations, gradually continued to become fraudulent like their teachers. They lost regard for truth and justice that happened to be cherished Ethos of Hindu society until two centuries ago!* \\n\\nMax Muller wrote the whole of Hindu literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth. He expressed doubt whether in any other of the ancient literatures of the world you will find traces of that extreme sensitiveness of conscience which despairs of our ever speaking the truth. *Now, ask yourself a question. Here stood Hindu society which practiced truth and justice by thought, speech and action for thousands of years, and with consistency. Could there have existed, unnoticed by all concerned, the gross social injustice of such magnitude in form of the infamous caste system? Was it the brainchild of those conspirators, who converted into reality of today, something that was nonexistent in the days of which they spoke of?* \\n\\nMax Muller writes, Hindus may teach us at least one lesson of truthfulness, that is, truthfulness to ourselves. *What did Christian educators do? Instead of learning that truthfulness from Hindus, they destroyed the truthfulness of Hindus.* This is what you acquire from an Aasuric religion like Christianity. They have destroyed your sense of ethics, justice, truthfulness all that you ever valued. \\n\\n*If it was all so good for 24 centuries continuously, as documented in the testimonies of non-Hindu visitors to this Hindu land, then what went wrong in less than two centuries? The answer is simple. Keeping all factors constant, the only variable on the scene is the presence of Aasuric influence of Christianity, which has eclipsed the Hindu society.* \\n\\n**Braahmans were the poorest of all**\\n\\n*It generally takes longer to build than to dismantle! Not for centuries, but for millenniums,* ***Braahmans*** *played the exemplary role. They themselves lived as the poorest of the lot but raised rich morals among the rest in the society. And, ample evidence of such rich morals, as documented by many-many foreign visitors to this Hindu land over more than two millenniums, you have already seen.* Do you remember the legendry poor *Dronaachaarya* who could not buy milk for his only child *Ashwatthaama*? Do you remember poor *Sudaama* who could only carry few grams when he went to meet his childhood friend Shri Krishn? Do you remember the stories that you read during your childhood? Whenever the central figure of the story happened to be a Braahman, did those stories not begin as \"Once upon a time there was a poor Braahman\"? Can you remember any story \"Once upon a time there was a rich Braahman\"? Well, I would not be surprised if you manage to find me one of them created during past fifty odd years by one of those MarxistCommunist intellectual professors of JNU who have mastered the technique of fabricating history in connivance with their bedfellow AMU professors. You will find enough evidence of such historical fabrications in *Seed-1.*\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nNow I invite you to take a special note of the fact that all the testimonies that I have presented before, are \\n\\n• Not by people who had a specific mission \\n\\n• Not by people who subscribed to a single ideology \\n\\n• Not by people who were part of a single theology \\n\\n• Not by people who were in any way connected with each other by an invisible thread \\n\\n• Not by people who had any reason to carry any special leaning in favor of the Hindus \\n\\n• Not by people who could be accused by any stretch of imagination that they were working together towards building a specific image for the Hindus. What does this all convey to you?\\n\\nThe extraordinary character and integrity of Hindu society was incomparable in the recorded history of mankind, and therefore, I see no reason whatsoever to be defensive about our ancient 4-Varn System and try to explain it away apologetically in the manner many modern interpreters tend to do. *It is their own low self-esteem that makes them do so. Their knowledge is of no use if they cannot see through the game plan of those conspirators who have brought their self-esteem to this low level.* \\n\\n*It is our 4-Varn System that prevented extinction of Hindu society under thousand years of barbaric Islam invasion, whereas* financially supported (by Hindus) one-class (monk based) Buddhist society was totally wiped out from BhaaratVarsh on account of the same Islamic invasion. \\n\\nHindu Society that was known for its regard for Justice over two thousand years \\\\[5th Century BC-AD 19th Century\\\\]. *Such society could not have been practicing gross social injustice within its own framework. This is nothing but plain and simple logic!* \\n\\n**A message to the Braahmans** \\n\\nI am not a Braahman by birth. I have no personal interest in defending you. I am on the side of Dharm.

I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house.

Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred.

Or also in my case as a way to think about how fast exponential growth is (I am a math teacher)\\n\\nIt goes something like this:\\n\\nWhen the game of chess was invented in ancient India it became extremely popular through out the country.  In particular there was a king that was especially fond of the game and quite good at it.  He was so confident in his abilities he made a challenge to his subjects that if someone could beat him at the game he would grant them any prize that was in his power to give.\\n\\nMany people attempted to beat the king but all failed, until eventually a timid man came forward to take the challenge and actually ended up winning the game.\\n\\nThe king being very impressed with the man\\'s skill asked what the man would like for his prize and the man responded:\\n\\nWhat I want is this: on the first square of the chess board place one grain of rice, on the second square of the chess board place two grains of rice, on the third square of the chessboard place four grains of rice and so on doubling the amount of rice on each square until you get to the end.\\n\\nThe king laughed at the seemingly humble request and called to his assistant to fetch a bag of rice from the store room.\\n\\nHowever the Kings accountants quickly realized that the mans request was far from humble, because if we went on continuing to double the number of rice on each square by the time we got to the 64th square there would be 2^63 grains of rice, or 9,220,000,000,000,000,000  or 9.2 Quintilian grains.  Which is more rice then the entire planet could produce in a thousand years.\\n\\nWhen the king realized the blunder he made by accepting to give this to the man, the man revealed himself to be the Hindu god Krishna (If I remember correctly, I could be wrong about their name)  and Krishna told the king that he did not expect payment right away and could be paid over time.  And so to this day people still offer rice to the god as penance for the arrogance that he displayed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain I just like this story because it illustrates exponential growth and the idea of \"look before you leap\"  But I wanted to know if this story was actually part of Hindu tradition, if it was actually Krishna or a different god,  and if it is not a part of Hindu cannon is it offensive to tell the story this way?  Because I think it is kind of like poetic justice to have it end that way.\\n\\n\\nAny thoughts or comments are welcome, thanks!', 'Yes it is a part of Hinduism. The temple \"Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple\" was built based on this action of Sri Krishna.

Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\n--------\\n\\nThis is a tough question to answer.

Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\nIt makes me wonder:\\n\\nWhat does one gain if it is not a dream, if it is not an illusion? If something is \"just\" a dream, this implies that there is some sort of reality to which \"just\" cannot be applied. What is that? When you scrape this real world, what comes off in your hand? It\\'s more than experiences, so what is it? What is left over that makes this real world more real than the illusory world?\\n\\nIf the problem with the illusory world is that it doesn\\'t have a point, the real one must. What is that, and how does it differ from a set of experiences?', \"One answer is that it will still feel real to you. If a Godhead is dreaming it or not doesn't really change the reality of pain/sorrow/enjoyment.

Can you explain in any clear terms what the statement \"A dream in the mind of the Godhead\" even means and why we should think that this is what is the case?\\n\\nI am not aware of a single Hindu school that says we are a dream in the mind of a Godhead. And this is why you\\'re not having any luck, it\\'s a nonexistent position only found in new age books and video games. ', \"Krishna Consciousness What is Paradise? Would it be some kind of situation in which every desire is satisfied? That would be a hollow kind of joy, and anyway, there would always be some unavoidable conflict with others wanting different things. Actually to want some kind of immortality as an individual ego is something very shallow, true joy begins where false ego ends.\\n\\nSo a more sophisticated explanation is something like “Nirvana” as it is described by certain Buddhist schools, the complete destruction and dissolution of all ego. It is clear that false ego is the primary cause of suffering, with all of the subconscious games it plays keeping us caught up in empty fascination. Hence the contemplative techniques, meditative techniques, found in all serious forms of religion, which are designed to help us see through our own selves, to look within and see the face beyond the masks. *“Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes”*, said Carl Jung.\\n\\nYet there is something unsatisfying about this. Ego-Death is a kind of death after all. There is something fundamental to humanity, the desire to live, something about the experience of being human which makes us wary of annihilation, even if it be a form of peace beyond that of individual existence. There is a natural desire to live, to be a human being, even if *“life is suffering”* as Buddha taught. This instinct often leads us away from religion, into the life of the senses and worldly pursuits for gain, but it can also lead us to a more holistic, more total, conception of a Paradise.\\n\\nKrishna Consciousness begins with the notion that we are all originally servants of God, whose qualities are encapsulated and present in the name KRISHNA. To be liberated from suffering is to return to our original position as servants of God, rather than as servants of the senses and of our desires. As God is in every way perfect, serving God is therefore the highest form of bliss any soul can attain.  \\n\\nUntil we turn away from the material life and engage in the Devotional Service of Krishna, again and again we are cast into physical bodies in order to satisfy particular desires and in accordance with the results of our previous actions. Just as the body changes from youth to old age but the soul remains the same, so do we change bodies but remain the same spiritual spark of consciousness. Returning to our original position, seeking to again become servants of Krishna, is the way to freedom from this cycle of Death and Rebirth known as Samsara. Thus it is taught that through Devotional Service we will attain rebirth on one of the spiritual planets collectively known as Vaikuntha and continue forever serving Krishna in His presence.\\n\\nThis whole conception quite nicely synthesises the other two conceptions of Paradise as Eternal Bliss or Ego Annihilation. What’s more, Krishna Conscious philosophy also includes in itself these other forms of Liberation or Paradise, which it considers to be partial and temporary. The worshippers of Demigods after the death of this body go to different planets where fulfilling the desires of the senses is very easy, before eventually returning to earthly realms. The “Mayavadis” and Buddhists who seek Ego-Annihilation are dissolved in the light emanating from Krishna, also eventually redescending into material creation.\\n\\nWhat we must understand is that Krishna is not an abstract concept or some incomprehensible effulgence. He is a personality (Vigraha) possessing all opulences. Sat-Chit-Ananda; Eternity, Bliss, and Knowledge. He is the Supreme Personality, qualitatively the same as us but quantitatively superior.  We must understand that Eternal Joy is found in no longer serving the Ego but serving Krishna instead. Everyone must serve something, be it some sectarian religion, their country, their family etc., but the intelligent person takes to serving Godhead. After all, God is the source of all things, the source of all happiness. We simply must accept that we are not and shall never be God, nor shall we find any permanent joy outside of serving Him.  \\n\\nThis Yoga of Devotional Service, is known by the Sanskrit name of BHAKTI YOGA.\\n\\nVarious simple rules were put into place by Prabhupada, the founder of the Krishna Consciousness movement in the West, for those wishing to practise Bhakti Yoga. There are four Regulative Principles: 1) No Meat Eating 2) No Gambling 3) No Intoxicants 4) No Illicit Sex, which devotees of Krishna should strive to conform to. In general we must avoid those things which keep us bound up with material nature, identified with the material body rather than the spiritual soul.  \\n\\nFood should be offered to Krishna before being consumed in order to free us from the Karmic effects of it’s production. We should not eat meat, fish and eggs along with onions and garlic are also prohibited. To kill, even an animal, is against the laws of nature, and cow protection is a central pillar of Krishna Consciousness – after all, the cow is like our mother, giving us milk. In general asceticism proves useful in returning back to the spiritual planets, back to Godhead, but we should not be extreme:\\n\\n“*There is no possibility of one's becoming a yogi, O Arjuna, if one eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.” (Bhagavad Gita As It Is 6:16).*\\n\\nNonetheless it is quite possible to seek to serve Krishna even if we haven’t mastered the Regulative Principles, any efforts will bear fruit. Most importantly, and before everything else, it is necessary to chant the MAHA MANTRA:\\n\\nHARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE  \\n HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE\\n\\nThis Mantra, the Holy Name, is not quite like many forms of prayer. We are not asking for anything except to be the servant of Krishna always, there is no question of wanting money or material exaltation. The chanting of the Mantra is compared to a child crying for its mother. It contains all the potencies of Godhead in its transcendental sound vibration. People remark that it is not tiring to chant this mantra as some other mantras can become. Devotees in these times try to chant a minimum of sixteen japa (16 x 108) of this mantra each day, though in the past saints have chanted many more and a few still do today.\\n\\nThe chanting of Holy Name was widely popularized by the last Avatar of Krishna, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, in the 15th and 16th century. He was the “Yuga Avatar” of Krishna, giving the appropriate teaching for the present age. We are currently in what is known as Kali Yuga, the dark age of the cycle of four ages. In this age human life is shorter, there is more suffering, little spirituality or charity and many other negative symptoms.

This is even more so when the Vedantaic schools blossomed because of their excellent explanations and theories on the areas of the World, God and Soul. \\n\\nI personally admire 'Srila Prabhupada' as a master of Bhakti Shastra, I like to believe his statements like how you said,\\n>Don't do that\\n\\nare agreeing to my point here, but the Hare krishna people on the ground, which we meet and interact, they don't seem to have understood fully that message of Shrila.

This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe).

Do all Hindu traditions actually place importance on the Vedas?I always heard how the word Hinduism is actually a word of foreign origin and is not the real name of the religion, but the real name is Sanatana Dharma in which the different traditions have their basis in their Vedas. How much truth is there in this claim, and where does the term come from?\\n\\nI haven't read Balagangadhara's work that in-depth yet, so I probably have a few things wrong, but what I've read so far is that the concept of Hinduism itself is a colonial construct that was created by the British, and that the concept of Hindu traditions being united by following the Vedas is something that came later so that Hinduism could be a real religion and fit somewhat of an Abrahamic framework. Basically, Abrahamic religions are the only religions, while other forms of practices are traditions.\\n\\nDo all traditions that are classified as Hindu actually value the Vedas, even if it's just lip-service? If not, then what is the basis of the term Sanatana Dharma? Was the concept of Sanatana Dharma actually a thing or was it just an attempt to create a Sanskrit term for Hinduism?\\n\\nThere's a lot of rambling here, so hopefully this makes some sense.\", \"Hinduism did not evolve as a single religion or identity, so no matter what you call it, it will be whimsical. That said, it is a good idea to call ourselves Hindu because it affords a social and political and even economic classification that can be helpful to keep traditions alive and make sure people aren't being preyed on.\", \"To understand what Balu is saying, one first needs to be clear about two themes in discussions - One, we are not talking about the names whichever one you use.(At best, a name can give a hint some shared concept exists, but words can also cause confusion, we can be divided by a common terms with different meanings). Two, he is not saying that 'Hinduism was constructed in the 19th century'. This has been said by a lot of postmodernists etc. \\n\\nInstead the issue is something like this - imagine you have two board games with very different rules and players of board game 1 see board game 2 and because of surface similarities, try to understand it as a variant of game 1. So things which are not seen by game 2 players are seen by game 1 players and some of the basic themes which actually do exist in game 2 are missed.\\n\\nWhat about the game 2 players? Because of the language issue and need to fit into laws designed by game 1 players, another thing happens - either game 1 words are understood by game 2 players in terms of their own concepts while being unaware of their original meaning(ie Indians dont understand western ideas even when using western words for previously existing concepts, ex: 'religion' is understood as dharma), or alternatively, game 2 players lose access to their own previous understanding(unlike the former case, they might actually understand dharma as religion) due to growing up in a new educational environment and game 2 just seems strange and incomprehensible(game 1 rules dont really work for understanding game 2) - why would anyone play it?\\n\\nSo, this is not a question of definition. Imagine, if alien anthropologists discover the chess board game along with extensive records of games. One can easily just go around defining 'chess' in terms of surface features like white pieces and black pieces, the shapes of pieces, 'we have discovered a lot of diversity - in this part of the world, the knight piece  looks different' without developing any understanding. They need to develop a theory of what is going on and test it against extensive record of annotated games.(Slowly discovering piece moves, exceptional things like en passant, when the game ends and so on)\", \"Some Yoga traditions are slient.

Since when Hindus started considering themselves as distinct religious community 3 Usefulness of  definition based on Vedic scriptures. \\n\\n1\\n>  Basically, Abrahamic religions are the only religions, while other forms of practices are traditions.\\n\\nThat would depend on definition of term religion itself right?  Definition of religion has evolved amongst anthropologists in last couple of centuries from definition which was very narrow,  applied to only organised sects. At that time catholicism and various branches of protestants like Lutherans, calvinism, anglicanism were considered separate religions and concept of religious freedom and separation of state and religion etc evolved even though everyone was Christian at that time. Now definition has broadened to something like \\n\\n> Religion is any cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, world views, texts, sanctified places, ethics, or organizations, that relate humanity to the supernatural or transcendental.\\n\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion  It is important to use broad definition of religion and consider Hinduism, Chinese traditional religion, shintoism etc as religions because special legal and social status modern society accords to \"religions\" as opposed to non religious ideologies. Eg Legal sanctions against discrimination based on religion etc. Social sanctions against persecution of someone because of his religion. For example it is socially acceptable to say \"punch a nazi\". It is socially acceptable or even socially required to fire someone for being a nazi even if that person has done no crime ever, participated in no violence and has done nothing more than hold some flag in some rally. While same society takes pains to constantly remind everyone #NotAllMuslims even though Muslim texts contain intolerant statements about Jews and infidels and there are instances of large scale violence by Muslims throughout history. \\n\\n2\\nStart of thinking of Hindus as one religious community definitely precedes British.  You have saints like Kabir preaching unity of \"Hindus and mussalman\". Sikh gurus saying be neither Hindu nor mussalman. These statements etc only make sense if popular conception at that time thought of Hindus and Muslims as two distinct religious communities. Shivaji founding hindavi swarajya,  maratha polity writing letters which show anger at tipu sultan\\'s forced conversion of Hindus in faraway kerala region etc also suggest pan Hindu communal identity in opposition to mussalaman was already in place. Without opposition to Muslims also we see one text describing Hindu as \"worshipper of narayana etc devatas\" . In pre-Islamic times we see division between astika traditions and nastika traditions in philosophical discussions though for ordinary people that division probably wasn\\'t much important. \\n\\n3\\nReason for defining Hindu using \"vedic scriptures\"  (which include scriptures other than Vedas  which accept authority of vedas) is simply practical. All extant non vedic nastika traditions that is Buddhism, jainism and Sikhism have rejected label Hindu. While all other astika organised traditions who accept authority of Vedas call themselves hindu. That leaves lingayats and masses of people who call themselves Hindus but may never have heard of Vedas. While hindu-ness of lingayats is controversial issue. Most of common Hindus who don\\'t belong to any officially vedic sampradaya have beliefs and practices extremely similar to those described in vedic scriptures. It is simply practical to define Hindus using vedic scriptures while being mindful of spectrum of scriptural to folk Hinduism.

'God of universe' vs 'God of man' .If we were to hit a rod onto the surface of a flowing stream, the undivided flow of water seems momentarily divided into two streams. In the evening sky, the moment the first star appears and twinkles, the otherwise unending sky appears to have acquired a point of reference, quadrisected into four cardinal directions.\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0This material world too, in all its eternity, gets divided into two parts as soon as the star of human awareness starts twinkling.\\xa0 Dichotomies like the beautiful and the ugly, the fragrant and the malodorous, the melodious and the harsh to hear, the soft and the hard, the dear and the unpleasant, the good and the bad, the divine and the evil, and others emerge as soon as human need becomes the point of reference in this cosmos. All that humankind considers good, pleasant and helpful is one part of this world while all that is unpleasant, all that unfavorably or adversely affects human existence is the other part of this world. He who creates the good part is “God” while he who creates the bad part is the “Rakshas”, “Asura”, “Satan” or “Devil”. Accepting these elementary human sensibilities as the working criterion for understanding the usefulness, goodness or badness of the cosmos is quite unavoidable.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Our ancestors realised ages ago that it was impossible to count, analyse, characterize and qualify or quantify each and every living species and non-living entity of this immeasurable and unfathomable universe. Instinctively they chose to analyse the things and beings in the universe using the five senses humankind is gifted with- touch, sight, scent, hearing and taste. Now everything had one or more attributes one could, well, “sense”. For example, the rose was red by color, soft to touch and fragrant by scent. While a fruit was sweet or sour by taste, aromatic by scent, cool and wet to touch, with a certain appearance for the eyes. A cuckoo was black to see and sweet to hear. A breeze was cool or warm to feel (to “touch”) while a sea storm was frightening to hear, forceful to feel and salty to smell. Given the primitive times then, this very idea of using the five senses was a veritable leap of human ingenuity! They developed this thought process to call the five senses representatives of the Pancha Maha Bhootas (The Five Great Elements), namely Pruthvi (Earth or the solid state of matter), Aap (Water or the liquid state of matter), Tej (Fire, light energy or radiations), Vaayu (Wind, air or gaseous state of matter) and Aakash (Outer space, vacuum or the Great Void). Spiritually, they theologized that whatever conversation or dialogue we humans could have with the God of this universe was also through these five senses, hence they even developed the concept of the five-headed deities, like Pancha Mukhi Mahadev, Pancha Mukhi Hanuman or Pancha Mukhi Ganesha.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Just as the process of studying the universe and its objects and beings with our five senses was so natural and instinctive, so were the attempts at trying to figure out if there indeed was any psyche behind the very forces who could create this universe. These forces were deified and became objects of faith across ancient cultures. The thought that came forward was that by creating this bounty and abundance of natural wealth for human prosperity, Nature was indeed very kind-hearted and affectionate like a mother who provided for her children, us human beings. Nature was\\xa0Mother\\xa0Nature,\\xa0Mother\\xa0Earth,\\xa0Mother\\xa0Life, the Goddess “Srushti” or “Prakruti”, who tended to us her children. By psyche she was all that a mother could be- affectionate, loving and providing. This “faith” has only been reinforced from time to time by the gifts Mother Nature has been showering onto us from time and again onto humankind till today! Likewise the Creator was Father Creator, the powerful “Purusha”, who though so powerful was yet, by psyche, so kind, gentle, caring and compassionate that He laid the very seed of human existence and a habitat to sustain human life!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Truly, for the benefit, utility and happiness of humankind, the compassionate God has created nature with such meticulous paternal love! This sun, this ocean, how majestically big these Great Elements! But the kind God employed even them for the service of humankind. Just as a mother would keep cool sweet water filled up for her kids coming home from their play out in the afternoon sun, so does the “Sun-God”, using sunrays as suction conduits, suck up only the water sans the salt from the salty oceans thereby sparing the sweet water of the rivers – and then store up this distillate in heavenly reservoirs, making it tempting even to the Gods! Just imagine the control mechanism over this saltwater-to-Sweetwater conversion – only as much capacity is there in the sunrays for this conversion as is the water required in one year and only as much is the water storage capacity of the celestial reservoirs- the clouds. At the same time, the oceans are themselves not turned sweet, sparing our whole life from becoming tastelessly bland!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Look at the animals! They are of various calibers of intelligence and various specializations, as varied as the varieties of services humankind expected of them in the pre-industrial ages! The Gods taught the camels the art of eating desert thorns and going without water for days, adapting them to life in a desert habitat – and they became the ship of the desert, a lifeline for sustaining human life in the inhospitable harsh desert! And how swift is the horse! God has given him strength and forbearance to both gallop for hours and to manoevour in the midst of a pitched battle all the time balancing and bearing the weight of a human rider for hours. There are many examples of steadfast loyalty where horses have even sacrificed their life for their masters, like the horse Chetak who carried Rana Pratap to safety before dying of exhaustion. Yet God has not over endowed the horse with the intelligence to ride a human being instead. Take the dairy cow or buffalo - one just has to push dry grass from one end to get rich, creamy, fresh, life-giving milk in abundance from the other end. Really, how kind God must be to his human children for creating such a biochemical process as milk formation! What’s more - God endowed the same dairy cow or buffalo that produces milk with the ability to leave behind her own progeny, a reproduced copy, with the very same miraculous biochemical abilities to turn dry unpalatable inedible grass into sweet, creamy milk before she retires or passes away. A milk-vending machine that vends not just milk but also another milk-vending machine!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0One has to sow just one grain of wheat - and it turns into a plant producing more than a hundred grains! Just\\xa0one\\xa0mango – a divinely juicy, delicious, nutritious, pulpy fruit – but it comes with its own seed that if sown and nurtured, turns into a majestic tree that gives\\xa0hundreds\\xa0of juicy mangoes for generations of a human family, year after year. Not just that, the mango even appears by branch grafting, producing whole orchards after orchards of the noble fruit in veritable abundance! Rice, millet or other varieties of different foodgrains with different nutrient profiles and tastes grow in all sorts of climatic conditions – in each case, one gets a whole sack full from one single, sowed grain. The varieties of fruits- pomegranates, bananas, apples, figs, jackfruits, dates… from different climatic profiles follow the same law - just\\xa0one\\xa0sown seed supplies enough fruit for satisfying the needs of at least a small family! All sorts of tasty, nutritious vegetables grow by themselves when kind of “ordered” by the mere act of being sown – the Lord God made this possible for us his human children! Then there’s sugarcane, after all a mere grass – with its weed-like propensity to proliferate wherever water is available. But when humans discovered its sweet juice, it just had to be disciplined into growing within the space allotted to it and nurtured by irrigation before it grew into vast lush stretches of such a generous produce that after being squeezed of its last drop of sweet juice by industrial scale sugar extraction processes, can still provide basic roughage to field oxen from leftovers! In fact, today’s scientists in the field of unconventional energy resources are researching the possibility of employing crops like sugarcane and even weeds from hillsides to generate the bio-fuel ethanol just when the world thought its fossil fuels were getting used up! Truly, when one resource dries up, another becomes available! How\\xa0can\\xa0we humans\\xa0ever\\xa0even quantify, leave alone repay, the kindness that God showered on humankind, making arrangements for every aspect of human existence!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0And what about human anatomy!\\xa0 From the soles of our feet to the most microscopic of the organelles of the brain, the layout of the human body is full of masterly, orderly planning and co-ordination- O Lord, how meticulously Thou hath designed our bodies for us! Our\\xa0human\\xa0eye- how many ages, eons, generations of evolutionary experiments hath Thou conducted to bring our eye to its present capabilities? Initially the eye was just a nervous tissue able to merely make out a ray of light, which could only differentiate illumination from utter darkness, recognize a shadow more than actual details of a form; but by continuous evolutionary experiments, trials and errors, we humans now have our beautiful, spherical, moist – and –\\xa0ambitious\\xa0human eye. Today the human eye is so capable that we humans have the ambitious foresight(!) to beat Thee at Thy own game, by inventing a duplicate eye, an extension, the telescope, to view not just the interiors of Thy own cosmic laboratory of outer space, but to discover none other than\\xa0Thee Thyself\\xa0 somewhere in space!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Further, how\\xa0can\\xa0one ever describe fully the festival of beauty and colours Thou hath conducted in the Three Worlds? The ultra-delicate flower of the Parijaat, the ultra-fragrant Golden Champak flower! The peacock’s vibrant plumage – the colors and design of every feather, the peacock’s inimitable gait! What a natural artist that noble bird is! When I watch the bird spread his plumage, dance with excitement and cry out aloud, believe me, O God, even my heart dances in sync with every step of this gifted bird and cries out Thy glory in admiration of Thy divine creation. In fact, I feel like sulking that\\xa0I\\xa0do not have the wonderful plumage of the peacock. The whole earthly creation resounds with the songs of birds and is a kaleidoscope of pleasant sights and landscapes! Roses, chamelis, bakulis, Juhis, Jaais, Champak, sandalwood, Ketakis… creepers and shrubs in full bloom, whole gardens full of them freshening and lending fragrance to the atmosphere! The Gods of love, Madan and Rati, are busy linking the hearts of lovers! The nights are starry, the dawns are pink, youth is confident and fresh, sleep is sound and deep, and love is like a cool breeze heralding the rhapsody of springtime. There is material and spiritual growth all over… O Lord, how can we humans not help thinking that such a beautiful world was created specially for us by Thee? If we love, nurture, protect and provide for our children, so doth Thee. Thou truly art both our father and mother and we Thy children. Even the milk our mothers give us is given ultimately by you. O Lord, we are Thy devotees and Thou, the Lord God of humankind, the God of Man!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Not just that, Thou art the only God, there can be no other and Thou hath created this world specifically for our peace and prosperity!\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0… This ideology, this concept of “The God of humankind” creating the universe specially for the survival and prosperity of Humankind could indeed have proved truthful and correct – if and only if everything, every being and all conditions in this world would have been only helpful, pleasant, beneficial and useful to humankind.\\xa0\\nBut alas! The cold fact is that most of this earth, the very earth we instinctively consider Mother Earth, Mother Nature and Mother Life is hardly all that safe, protective, kind and considerate to us humans as we were just philosophizing. On the contrary, the living conditions existent on this planet and influences of the atmosphere, the sun, moon and stars in reality seem to contradict our pet theory of faith too much – conditions that obtain on earth are mostly inhospitable, harsh, with the law of the Jungle working all the time around us. Humankind has to struggle for its very survival and struggle still further for ensuring prosperity.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Take a good look at the very Sun and oceans we sung paeans in praise of just some time ago. The way the unsparing rays of the hot sun finish off a helpless victim of sunstroke or heatstroke is quite comparable to the ruthlessness with which a gatekeeper watchman beats a poisonous snake by repeated relentless blows- striking the final blows even when half-dead. In the very India where millions of Hindu Brahmins offer prayers to the Sun God every sunrise and sunset, the very same sun shines hot for the entire spell of a drought or famine, even lasting several years, killing thousands of heatstroke, hunger or thirst.\\xa0\\nIn the Quran, Talmud, Torah and Bible, devout prophets sang in praise of God Yahweh, “For us Humans, O God, Thee hath kept a plentiful supply of fish for us to eat in the oceans!” But the same oceans are also full of creatures like human-eating sharks which can eat a human body alive and whole. The oceans are also teeming with other forms of sea life like poisonous snakes, sting rays, electric rays and the Portuguese-Man-of-war which can either kill, maim or in any other way seriously harm any human form in sea-water – a swimmer or diver, a shipwrecked sailor, a fisherman, marine biologist or oceanologist – the ocean Gods are quite busy nurturing these forms of life harmful to man with sustained impartiality. Quite similar to a mugger who first poses as a traveler’s guide, then waits for an opportune time to shed his mask to finally loot his trusting quarry in the middle of nowhere, the ocean, while carrying afloat thousands of rafts, boats and vessels at a time, suddenly throws some of them off its back and into its terrible jaws to swallow up entire vessels and ocean liners like the doomed Titanic, drowning all the thousands of people aboard in one gulp. Oceans can unpredictably erupt into tsunamis sucking entire populations of coastal settlements into their watery graves.\\xa0\\nRivers in Africa, Australia and South America are full of potentially human-eating creatures like alligators, piranha and crocodiles. The holy rivers, on whose banks civilizations and cities flourished, can swallow up entire townships or at least several thousand helpless people and animals in one spate, be they the Holy Mother Ganges or Jamnaji, the Brahmaputra, Hwang-Ho or Nile, the Holy Jordan or the Father Thames.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Primitive Semitic devotion believed in the Abrahamic Books that the Elohim (Yahweh of the Bible and Allah of the Quran) created the goat, lamb, deer and other creatures so that his believers would get lots of meat to eat! But the devotion with which the believer smacks his lips on seeing “food” animals blinds him to the obvious fact that the same world in which he resides with his “food” animals is also home to potentially man-eating animals like the big wild cats, crocodiles, bears and sharks. If a man-eating Sunderban Royal Bengal tiger preys on an unsuspecting human child and is spotted smacking his lips after devouring the child’s flesh, should we say that God created small human children with tender flesh just so that some man-eater can have a delicious meal? And as if to provide icing on a cake, the world has its share of dangerous vegetarian beasts as well, from the very herbivorous African river hippos that can cut a human form into two in one snap of their jaws (just as easily as we crunch a slice of cucumber at our dinner table), to the grass-munching land giants like the bison or Assamese rhinos and ultimately the largest land mammal, the\\xa0 solitary bull African elephants all of whom are known to kill humans more often than do the carnivorous big cats. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0When a tsunami strikes a coast, it sucks in everything it can from coastal human inhabitation- brides in their own wedding ceremonies about to garland their grooms, mothers suckling their meek hungry and vulnerable infants, artists with unfinished paintings and sculptures, lovers locked mid-ardor oblivious to the world, devotees in mid-meditation with spiritual ecstasy… entire cities like Dwarika and Atlantis, regions and subcontinents have gone under water, got buried under volcanic lava like Pompeii… as quickly as Ganesh devotees immerse a Ganesh idol in the sea – with cataclysmic precision. And yet, the next daybreak, the same Dawn Goddess Usha, who was soulfully venerated with sacred chants of the Vedas, appears as pink as always over the destruction.\\xa0\\nThe Quran quotes that Allah created the moon so that the believer could tell the parts of the day to know when to offer namaz. But when the “infidel’ Chengiz Khan stormed Baghdad, the cultural capital of Islamdom, massacring all Momins in his wake, slaughtering clerics and the Caliph with his family, demolishing the whole city, razing all buildings and walking over a pile of cut heads of killed Muslims, did not the moon still rise over the same Baghdad that night too, informing the namaz-hating Chengiz Khan about the times of the day just as it did the namaz-performing Muslims?\\xa0\\n\\nFragrant flowers, melodiously singing songbirds, the haughty peacock with his inimitable plumage, even entire forests get roasted alive in a single bushfire or forest fire, like we roast a brinjal on a flame. \\nWhile a human population trustingly plays the game of life in the daytime and rests secure every night in the lap of Mother Earth, some particular moment the same terra firma demolishes the unsuspecting population with one earthquake tremor – buildings get flattened, both huts and architecturally marvelous monuments of human creativity and civilisation, like a pack of cards ceases to exist. Entire villages can be swallowed alive in a moment with the same earth opening up a giant crevice in an earthquake!\\xa0\\nHistorically giant meteors have hit the earth and in some cases, even set in massive cycles of climatic change and destruction with extinctions of entire species. Can a flaming comet also not suddenly appear out of the blue (from outer space) and hit the surface of the earth setting ablaze entire regions much like a flaming torch can set ablaze a whole pile of cotton?\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0For every lifestyle there exists a dysfunction. The human body, when diseased, is a museum of pathologies and pain- furuncles, epilepsy, tumours, agony, coma, palpitations, diabetes and heart arrests… The world out there has its rounds of bubonic plagues, famines, cholera epidemics …\\xa0\\nOur faith and belief that humankind is the centre of reference for the whole universe and that not just\\xa0our own\\xa0planet - the earth with her plentiful resources and life forms - but the whole\\xa0cosmos\\xa0was created by God\\xa0only\\xa0for humankind,\\xa0only\\xa0to favour humankind,\\xa0only\\xa0to provide pleasure to humankind and\\xa0only\\xa0out of special partisan fondness for humankind, eventually crystallized into belief systems, some open to contrary thought and other times closed to alternative view-points, like unbending dogma unwilling to confront rationalism. We humans even created religious texts of this dogma, selectively only documenting phenomena supportive of our theory that God first manufactures and then employs even stars, planets, comets, black holes, galaxies and constellations exclusively for sustaining human existence, protecting human life, providing fun, pleasure and entertainment to humans and eternally providing resources to human civilization, happiness and prosperity. This blinkered approach has only blinded us to stark, obvious natural phenomena and unpleasant observations of accidents and natural catastrophes endured by humankind that contradict our doctrine of “God’s Creation for human welfare”. We have to free ourselves of the shackles of this dogmatic conditioning to outgrow our primary assumption and adopt the approach of unbiased reasoning and dispassionate analysis to explain observations both pleasant and unpleasant.\\xa0\\n\\nFaith in this God-of-man theory can best be treated as a development of the primitive emotional human mind at its most innocent, childlike, seeking state. Faith created scripture - we can even marvel at the poetic expressions and emotional inputs that created some devotional scripture. We can pragmatically and patiently hear out, even study with interest all religious, devotional and ritualistic versions of the same God-of-man belief across the world as necessary stepping stones in the evolution of the human mind. Not all scriptures are unbending dogma. Some scriptures and cultures like the Indic (Bhakti-Vedantic, Buddhistic and Jain), Greek, Egyptian (Pre-Arian and Arian) and Far Eastern (Taoist, Confucian, Shinto) showed a readiness to discuss alternate viewpoints freely, while other types of scriptures like the Bible and Quran show the otherwise seeking human mind trapped at some primitive stage of thought not amenable to reasoning, with self-imposed fossilization, in the evolution of human thought processes.\\nIt is\\xa0completely beyond\\xa0human reasoning powers to deduce the real intention due to which or without which this cosmos came into existence even with the best of telescopes, space exploration technology, knowledge of physics and mathematics – or with the most insightful of meditative techniques. We can only reason this much – the world and cosmos are not specially created for man; man matters little to other space bodies, whatever our earthly human thoughts - theist or atheist, scientific or devotional. We humans are only as significant in the big universe as may be some other creature- some worm, germ, bug or bee. In other words, humans are no more than a very ordinary, temporary production in the eternal flow of time and the incessant dynamics of the universe.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Thus, crops do not grow, fruits do not ripen or spices are not delicious so that humankind should be fed good food. Crops grow, hence humans can eat them – that’s all. Rivers do not flow because humankind needs water- on the contrary; we happen to get water because rivers flow. Even when it was the age of the dinosaurs before the evolution of modern humans, rivers had been flowing, flowers were blooming, the stars were twinkling – just as they do so now! Even when the earth was under the grip of the ice age, or even before the very birth of earth, this very own home planet - the sun had its cosmic motion unfazed by anything else. Why, even if this very\\xa0sun\\xa0or our very own Milky Way were to vanish, the rest of the cosmos would be probably as affected as the luminosity of daylight is affected by the death of a firefly. Such an unfazed, unperturbed cosmic power that would not elicit even a moment’s mourning by the sudden nemesis of a hundred suns or solar systems even on a daily basis\\xa0can\\xa0still be venerated as “God” (to satiate human spiritual hunger) but slightly differently - as the “God of the universe” - certainly not as our older conception of “God of Humankind”.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0If our “God of Humankind” would\\xa0not\\xa0have provided even\\xa0elementary\\xa0aids of survival, some minimal resources to exploit or primitive conditions of protection from the wild side of nature, could anyone or anything have stopped Him from disallowing any human existence? Yet, the human race\\xa0did\\xa0get access to natural bounty as comprehended by our five elementary human senses,\\xa0could\\xa0exploit resources and\\xa0could\\xa0modify circumstances to make quite a few habitats hospitable to human survival.\\xa0 Not only did humans survive, they prospered into civilizations. They did not just get a world, they got a rich earth, with rivers of water, edible foods, and useful animals – with fragrant flowers, scenic beauty and melodiously singing birds added in to enliven existence. The human race has eventually flourished so far, certainly not perished!\\nYet, this appearance of human life on earth, juxtaposed in the evolutionary history of the earth, itself juxtaposed in the eternal universal upheaval of creation, sustenance and destruction, is no more than a speck in time, a temporary, ordinary and miniscule event not worth reckoning in the largely unknown, unfathomable history of the universe. Whatever dependability nature has shown with whatever few conditions encouraging human existence on this planet earth, are\\xa0merely a coincidence. So long as this coincidence lasts, so long as we survive as humans, we humans can term this coincidence, this favorable set of circumstances, the “God of Humankind”; we can even offer Him a flower out of devotion and gratitude. To this, and only to this limited extent, can we condescend to say that the “God of Humankind” is kind to, partial towards and protective of his human “children”.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Mentally envisaging the “God of the universe” is merely going logically further in our God-conceptualization exercise. There are two techniques, scientific and spiritual, essentially complementary to each other. Scientifically, we have space shuttles and telescopes augmenting the eye, to note birth of stars or their celestial burial in black holes. Spiritually, ancients reached yogic contemplative planes like Saptapatal, Brahmalok, Vishnulok, Devalok, etc. through meditation augmenting the inner mind. Either way, the universe (or the “God” of the universe) is uninfluenced by prayers, unperturbed by human emotions, unaffected by human birth or death, prosperity or tragedy, too abstract to be affected by anything, partial towards no one, certainly not humans, is equally responsible for both genesis and nemesis. Neither does this power purposefully bless us, nor purposefully punish us. This “God of the universe” is too subtle and omnipotent to be a personality like a jealous Old Testament Yahweh who vindictively resorts to curses against and punishments like sending locusts and frogs against bonded followers trespassing into worshipping alternate God-forms.\\xa0 The power of the “God of the universe” is also not thanks to some seat or tag of authority, like is the case of the celestial Indra (whose power being not his own but by virtue of the\\xa0throne\\xa0of the “ruler of heaven-residing deities”), who insecurely presupposes that anyone engrossed in meditation, sage or demon alike, can get strong enough to usurp his throne and depose him. The “God of the universe” requires no medium like angrily foaming prophets whose careers were nothing more than haranguing people into remaining bonded to the Old Testament books of dogma by issuing dire warnings, or mysterious secretive shamanic witch-doctors sacrificing poor animals to entities like demons and spirits in occult rituals while mumbling to themselves in a state of mind bordering on epilepsy, creating a whole plethora of lesser Gods, demi-Gods and other entities taking their toll tax from a seeker on a spiritual quest on the way towards the real God unluckily trespassing onto their domain of esoteric teritory. The God of the universe could freely be “He”, “She”, even “It” - we don’t know, we can call this force what we want.\\n\\nConceptualising God of this nature requires not just intellectual effort but also spiritual courage. We now have a God to bow before but we must learn to take care of ourselves in individual and collective crises in life within the framework of natural laws,\\xa0praakrutik dharma. If one is the captain of a sinking ship, one should use all knowledge in navigation and ship mechanics to save the ship, passengers and cargo first – all prayers to the God of the ship or the God of the Seas or the God of humankind are only\\xa0after\\xa0all realistic efforts are instituted. Like vitamin B complex helping the main medicine fight an illness, rather than becoming the medicine itself denying other specific medicines the credit of working. Thus the God of humankind is nothing other than one side, namely the bright, congenial side - the feel-good factor - of the God of the Universe. Whether the devotionally conceived God of Humankind partial to humankind or the intellectually conceptualized God of the Universe partial towards no one, we can treat every conception with respect, since we term the conception “God”. Particularly when we have first respected the “God of humankind” and then pulled Him into the morass of half-baked notions of devotion, the “God of the universe” deserves greater respect.\\nWe first invested the conception of the God of humankind with human emotions and personalities, good and bad traits, then invoked Him (or Her) to account for each and every positive or negative personal event and gradually, pulled down Divinity into the mud, demoted the stature of our conception of “divinity” into an entity that serves our selfish interests and base desires by ordinary bribes of prayer. The bigger our personal desire, the more flamboyant or expectant our prayer gets - the “God of Humankind” would do us good if we conduct some sacrificial rite, organize a Satyanarayana Pooja, attend successive masses of Novena or repeatedly visit a fakir’s mausoleum. Imagining any covenant with the “God of Humankind” simply ties us up in illogical knots - if we offer prayers of gratitude to God for saving us from danger, then who presented us with these dangers in the first place? The same “God”! First He slits our neck and then He heals it. If we should worship Him for healing us, should we also not full-fledgedly blame Him first for hurting us? It is like the story of two roadside beggars fighting amongst each other saying, “I am right, you are wrong” and desperately but unsuccessfully trying to get the judgment of superiority from an emperor whose retinue passing momentarily by their way – the emperor does not even notice, the convoy passes ahead and the two beggars go back to wrestling each other in the muck. Well, invoking the “God of Humankind” for these twin emotional outbursts of blaming and thanking, for every worthless and inconsequential event of life, is worse than the fight of these two roadside beggars. The age and limits of our universe are too big to even be measured - human devotional tantrums do not matter at all.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0What is\\xa0rational\\xa0is that we can study, infer, discover, analyse, comprehend, teach each other and then recode for posterity the\\xa0laws\\xa0by which the universe and its components exist, govern themselves and act or interact. We can then try and align ourselves with the laws of the functioning of nature and the universe in ways beneficial to the human race, conducive to our survival. This is the only thing possible for us humans. Thus any act, behaviour or conduct of a human being conducive and helpful to the survival of the whole human race and to our habitat (the earth and “her” environment) in the long term is\\xa0good, ethical and correct\\xa0behaviour. On the contrary, any thought or conduct that can make us perish or destroy our own habitat, anything that can adversely affect human survival or can be a deterrent to long-term human survival of our human habitat is\\xa0bad, unethical and incorrect\\xa0behaviour. This definition of human ethics is workable, rational and clear to understand. But beliefs like “What ‘God’ likes is ethical” and “That which is helpful to Humans is liked by God” are untrue and untenable, in fact too childish to sustain. We need to realize that we are part of the universe, but the universe is not ours or ruled by us. To a negligible extent the universe favours us. To a much greater extent, the universe is unfavourable to us. Accepting this truth clearly, bravely and unhesitatingly is being both human and humane. And this is the true religion of the entire human race, the true worship of the “God of the universe”.\", 'Really profound but lengthy post.', ' the purusharth of veer savarkar ji is an inspiration.\\n\\nHis whole life is a testament to the power of sheer will.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha.

For one definition we know Dharm means righteousness. If Krishn's Dharm means righteousness then what does he mean by righteousness. Is it the righteousness of action, or the results? In the Mahabharat Kaurav took the land and exiled Pandav. Kaurav basically symbolize a behaviour which is to be considered as bad and many a times abhorrent. Not respecting the women, confiscating properties, later refusing to return what's not theirs, breaking laws, not being Just despite being the rulers, trying to kill their family members and many more thing I might not be aware of. This is to be punished and maybe this is what Krishna means. Maybe justice is the idea of Krishn's version of Dharm.   My primary argument was that Krishna did many of the acts which can be associated with trickery, deceit and slyness. But he did everything to bring justice. He's like the one of the most Griffindors in the Griffindor house, break the rules to do good. Like Harry, Hermione and Ron would break the rules to to do good here Krishna is doing just the same. The good should rule not matter the means.  The major antagonist in the story is Duryodhan, he is the source of all the conflict and rest of the characters in Kaurav's side revolve around the whims and wishes of this character. If this person was eliminated from the story the basis of whole Mahabharat would collapse. Naturally Dhritrastr would return the land and Kingdom to the Pandav brothers, may even the whole kingdom.   So, Duryodhan is the biggest plot point of the story. But there's one more plot point which is as much important. And it is  Kurn. Despite Krishna's knowledge that he was son of Kunti he did not allow Kurn to participate in Draupadi's Swayamvar for the obvious reasons that Krishn wanted Draupadi to marry Arjun and not Kurn. Why would Krishn do that? Krishn being a god knew the future can was well aware about the war. He was who took it to the level of war. Had he wanted he'd have killed Duryodhan long back during Draupadi cheerharan and punished Pandav brothers to use Draupadi in the game, all in the name of Dharm.  The point is, if you are an omniscient being where you could do anything, you are the one who is running the game. The war was not a result of one but a number of incidents, of which the omniscient being was part of many. It is not wrong to say that the war was Krishn's will.  But why? Answer is maybe the whole point of designing the situations which would lead to war is to set an example. The example to show the world that in the way of being righteous even if you have to kill your family members it's the right thing to do.\", 'What is Hinduism iSo what I learned in school about Hinduism is basically reincarnation and they believe in lots of gods also they cant eat meat.

I was always insanely interested in knowledge, history in specific, and spirituality even more.\\n\\nI\\'ve spent the last 2 - 3 or so years (I\\'m 18 years old as of writing this), I\\'ve been focusing on spirituality in a very hardcore manner (even more serious than everything from before combined), studying constantly, spending all my time either meditating or studying. I\\'ve studied Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Taoism, and many Nordic beliefs, and finally Satanism (not Christian\\'s version. There\\'s a form of Satanism that has nothing to do with Christianity, and teaches similar ideas to Hinduism. I thought that was it for me, because it preached about you growing your own soul through meditation, yoga, using energy to open your soul, see into the Psychic realm (non-human beings), open your chakras and to unite the female and male sides of your soul, with the ultimate goal being raising your Kundalini serpent past the last chakra and achieving Godhood yourself. I know what I was doing 100% had some effect, but in the end I realized it was only an illusion too, with only hints of truth to distract you from the truth. I came to peace with that, and it took me a very, very, very long time to do that completely.\\n\\n\\nWARNING: In this next section I am going to explain my experiences over the last three weeks, and how it has changed me into a different man, along with some general backround knowledge. During these three weeks ONLY, I was basically under the influence of Marijuana, but I would like to remind all of you, that mind altering substances have been used as a helping hand in spiritual growth for millennia, including Hinduism. I have no further desire for the substance, and will never touch it again. However, I do not regret doing it. Because of my choices, here I am today, and I regard these three weeks as an experience given to me by a higher power, and I\\'d like to explain that.\\n\\nA lot of symbolic things happened that has relevance to Hinduism. For example, the entire three weeks, I would play Overwatch, meditate, and sleep. I ate maybe four or five times the entire three weeks (not because of the fact that I thought I had to starve myself, I just genuinely didn\\'t need to). I felt a strong draw to my PS4 specifically, not for the game, not for the console, but for use as a conduit in ways. I look at it, and yes, it appears to be a PS4, but I can see so much more on the flip-side. It is a tool to connect you to people and to compete. During these 3 weeks, I would play Zenyatta on Overwatch to represent myself going through a spiritual journey, and as I would take the next steps in this journey, I would become better at playing him. And then I started to think, maybe me playing Overwatch on my PS4 is proving my skill on another level of existance? Or triggering something in the future, past, or in a parallel reality?\\n Because I didn\\'t play Overwatch in a traditional sense. I used my emotions to fuel my skill. It was like I was using my mind to control the controller directly, no longer needing to use my body to move, just dictating my body commands from a different perspective. What I would do was force myself to feel a specific way, depending on what the scenario needed. If we were losing a checkpoint, I would fuel all of the rage inside of me into defending it, always focusing on the objective. And I would destroy. Imagining past battles in history, imagining the pain that people had to deal with, everything. I channeled whatever feeling the situation needed into the situation.\\n\\nI started to get noticed, and then something weird started happening that marked the start of this long 3 week journey. I was in Quick Play, and I was talking to this boy, maybe 14, or 15 years old? And he bore a striking resemblance to me when I was younger. For the entire journey after meeting him, almost every single game I would play in Overwatch, would have him in it, without me inviting him, having him as a friend, or anything. Just random matches, but always the same person under a different name. I even ran into him on the PC edition of the game. Remember earlier when I said symbolism with the beliefs of Hinduism? It\\'s like the same scenario with Shiva. You revere Shiva as the only God, but there are many others that lead to him, and just like that system of beliefs, I always ran into this boy.\\n\\n\\nSo I thought to myself, he has to be my guide, right? This has to be it.\\nI started meditating on it and was thinking about it, and came to the conclusion (I was a Satanist at the time as described earlier) that Satan was trying to guide me towards a path of enlightening the world, a path in which everyone would leave material desires behind and embracing a life of peace and true wisdom. But over the three weeks, I realized, there was no such thing happening (not in the way I thought anyways) ~~ I meditated for nearly 12 hours a day, ate only 4 or 5 times total the entire 3 weeks, and had absolutely no short term memory. There were days were I was so disconnected from myself, that I didn\\'t even know who I was or what I was, moving like a robot with no goals, nothing. It became hard to exist, hard to think, hard to speak, hard to interact with the world. I was in seclusion for weeks, and it was almost like controlling my body from a higher point of view. Like in a RTS game, controlling an entire squad at once for example. I felt like one of the soldiers ready to die for the cause. Coming to peace with everything took awhile, but I came to the point where I left the world behind completely in my own mind, and I was ready to start a new life with a new name and complete this journey. I gave many tests to this spiritual force, and many things did happen. I realized now it had not been Satan guiding me, but something else. And then I looked into Hinduism out of nowhere (it popped into my head randomly) and saw how Shiva is regarded. And I did further research and discovered the belief that all different paths all lead to the same thing. And there was SOOOO much Symbolism in those three weeks happening with the exact same idea. And I gained the ability (limited at this point in the story) to see (not really with my eyes, kind of like a mental awakening) more truly than ever before. I look at my monitor now, and don\\'t see a TV exactly, I see that it can be many things, and be used for many things. While I was on this spiritual journey, I noticed also that there was a full moon every night. I didn\\'t realize it at first, but I counted at least 6 days where there were full moons (which is impossible?). I would sleep during the day and wake up at night, meditate, meditate, and hone my hand eye coordination with Overwatch (right now I have basically aimbot level skill with Zenyatta). I used Overwatch as a tool to dig up my deepest feelings basically in a sense (the feelings I had suppressed when I was very young). When I would get killed, I would be furious, and then I would try to amplify that feeling, and try to come back and get revenge, and it worked a few times, but then it just made me worse and worse in skill. And I realized at that moment, that I had to come to peace with myself, that I needed to live life not driven by greed or selfish desires. So I meditated, and I asked myself, why does it make you bad? And I figured out something I never thought I would. While meditating, I started to see things clearly, with distractions pushed to the side. I realized I wanted to not only be important, but I wanted to serve, and bring peace to the world in any way I could. And I was angry because I was suppressing that, not knowing what I wanted to do with my life at all, going from job to job not happy. Even now, I still dream of a world where people can leave greed aside and focus on the spiritual truths of life, living a simplistic yet rewarding life. But then, this triggered an even deeper awakening of my mind, and I started to see the duality in every action of life, every decision. I started to realize things, and see deep on levels I never thought possible. Let\\'s say you walk to the fridge with the goal of getting some water, but then you decide you don\\'t want water in the end? What happens to that thought? What happens to that possibility, that alternate choice? I believe in the principle of duality ~ harmony and chaos. But I also believe there is a middle ground beyond harmony and chaos, a grey zone. What if I could experience all of the possibilities in my previous example? What if with all of those lost memories, forgotten in time, there is a way to bring it back and experience it, to keep it as part of you and to grow from it, to let it guide you? Have you ever thought about ancient humanity, the day to day life of people, their rituals, their way of life. I have, and I wish I could learn everything, and be a voice that continues the traditions going.\\n\\nI\\'m someone that desires knowledge more than anything, particularly about spirituality. I devoted my life to nothing but the study of truth long ago, and that\\'s what led me here today. I do believe in the principle of duality, but I also do believe in an even greater state of being. A combination of chaos and peace, using it for each situation as a guide. It may not be possible in this life, but my goal is to learn everything, simply put. I want to know everything about everything, no matter the cost to me, physically, mentally, or spiritually. Everything I\\'ve been through has left me with a burning passion that is more powerful than any obstacle. I say now that I will learn everything, and I will defy what I know, because think about it. In this situation, you can choose the middle ground, but there are instances I believe in which you can change what the middle ground actually is, incorporating duality itself into the middle ground that Buddha spoke about. And I believe this is one of those scenarios. Yes, I can choose to know everything, yes, I can choose to know nothing. But what if I want to know everything, and nothing at the same time? To look at existence itself from a 3rd party view, to see it all, be able to experience it, to experience time out of sequence, to be able to relive everything like watching a recorded movie. What if I want to spiritually grow and go past levels of existence even comprehendable by myself (and trust me, I can comprehend a lot of stuff) ~~ But still remember moments like this that defined that journey? Me writing this post, my dog laying on my couch, it being nice and sunny outside but not too hot, and to be able to incorporate even simple memories like this, and experience true knowledge, wisdom, logic, into teachings, in order to expand the minds of others?\\n\\nWhat I desire the most, is to be a servant to truth itself. Making it be known, all illusions aside. To lift the veil that\\'s been cursing humanity for many, many years.\\n\\nI realize this sounds weird, but I have the feeling that Shiva was guiding me in one way or another, because there were a lot of things that happened during this journey. While I thought it was Satan guiding me, at least I knew it was something, and now I realize it could have been Shiva in a different form. There were many days were I felt dead inside during these three weeks. I renounced everything and left it behind, trying to take the path of complete peace and abandon chaos. I realize now, that it\\'s impossible. For peace to exist, there must be struggle. It\\'s all part of the journey. It was very painful, not clinging to emotions, leaving everything behind. I felt like a robot, with no purpose. And then my memory started to go down the drain, and it came to the point were I had no memory, I had no identity, I had nothing. I realized then when I left everything behind that I was clinging onto delusions, and I had to take the middle path, as there cannot be life without death, on any level of existence. I thought I had to die physically. I\\'d convinced myself, I\\'d lay down in my bed, go to sleep, and whatever God existed would make it so I would wake up in another life. I talked in my head with someone and said, will I die tonight when I go to sleep? And that person said \"Yes, but not in the way you expect.\" I could see him too, in a way. Like... A picture hidden behind a veil. He honestly looked like Gandhi, minus the glasses and a bit younger looking than photographs online show, and standing straight up. I woke up the next day and thought of it all as fake and said forget life and gave up. And my mind crumbled into Chaos. I knew at the time my spiritual beliefs were a deception, and I said I\\'m finally done living. I got to the point where I accepted death, embraced the feelings of nothingness and savored it, almost getting turned on in a sadistic way by the thoughts of the many ways I could die. But then when it never happened, it triggered something in me that not only destroyed me physically, mentally, and spiritually, it awakened me, and I rebuilt from the rubble of my old weak mind. There was a point where there was nothing. And I meditated, because I wanted to feel something. Then I came to the conclusion I didn\\'t need to die, and I wasn\\'t going to yet. Before, I thought my purpose was to die, be reincarnated into a new life, and save the world spiritually in a sense (true Satanists believe in reincarnation also) ~ but then I realized, the goal was never to die physically. Through this entire journey, something was guiding me, telling me exactly what to do, what to say, what to feel. I felt like a slave, trapped in a body, wanting to move on. And then I meditated, and I thought about my suffering, and thought about why I wanted to die so bad truly, and then the illusions started slipping away, and peace started to come back. And in that instant, it was like that previous life of mine had been destroyed, and I finally found my way to the middle path. It triggered a feeling in me of death on all levels, including mentally. I thought I was completely dead on every level, but then I started to meditate, and think, and use my experiences in the past as a guide, like putting together a puzzle. I realized, what I wanted to do with my life was truly dedicate myself to my study, and to help spread knowledge and wisdom. I wanted to be the black sheep that would take all of the pain, and show everyone the true way, the \"easy\" way. But then I realized the duality with my next awakening. Ignorance is a bliss, and the path of knowledge is not for everyone, and I realized then that there was no \"easy\" way. I realized that yes, I\\'ve been through a journey all of my life, but so has everyone else, and so will everyone else. And while I may be able to guide people the right direction, it will be on them to find peace within themselves. No God, no person, nobody can do it but themselves, because I realized that you have to WANT the truth, to SEE the truth. I would like to emphasize with everyone here, I have an insanely strong mind in a spiritual and mental sense. When I was a child, I was tormented by insomnia and \"evil thoughts\" and had terrible thoughts in my head when I would try to go to sleep, and one day I decided the only way I would be happy was to destroy it. So I stopped thinking. After a few weeks, it became natural, and to this day, I still have a clear head, with not a thought going through it. But, through those three weeks? It was the opposite, and I experienced for the entire three weeks the suffering and chaos I had suppressed. And after all of the mental rubble and debris got cleaned up, I came out stronger than ever before.\\n\\nREAD THIS: I thought this important to denote, I was instantly drawn specifically to Shaivism when researching about Hinduism. And looking now on Wikipedia, it seems many of the things and experiences I\\'ve been through aligns perfectly with what Shaivites beleive. Throughout this entire post, I\\'m sure there are many methods of thinking that sync up to Shaivism beleifs. This leads to a further question below that I honestly want you guys to take seriously.\\n\\nEverything I\\'ve been through paints a clear picture, but honestly I just need guidance on two things.\\n\\n\\nACTUAL QUESTIONS:\\n\\nHow can I devote myself to my study and start on this lifelong journey? I live in the USA, and I\\'m German, and I know it\\'s probably unheard of someone coming to this path of life, from where I come from, but I would like to move to India and renounce my past life eventually. I want to know what I can do to get started on my journey, because honestly, I\\'m out of clues. I will do research and continue to grow, but advice would be appreciated. You can\\'t exactly google how to move to India and join a group of people (I\\'ll give an example, the Hindu equivalent of becoming a Buddhist monk and devoting himself to his studies, living in a temple) ~ I have done a little bit of research and I know it\\'s possible, so I would like to skip the Second Ashrama and choose the path of becoming a Sannyasa, no matter how long it takes. I know I\\'m 18 years old, but I feel that this is my true calling. And I feel once I reach that point, I can go even further than that. At the moment, I don\\'t know too much about Hinduism in a deep sense, so I\\'m going to do a lot more research, and start living a lifestyle of a Shaivite specifically to prepare myself (as this is the system of beliefs that I align with absolutely 100% without a doubt, and it just feels right to me naturally). But if you guys understand what I desire, and you know anything that can help me on my journey, I would so appreciate any knowledge.\\n\\n2nd question, is it possible that I am a reincarnation of some type of philosopher? The only reason I ask this is because I\\'m drawn very strongly not only to Shaivism, but to the Dharma, to the truths of life, and to the dualities of life. It\\'s like... I\\'m being guided by memories I can\\'t remember, but they\\'re still influencing me and helping me grow, and slowly unlocking more and more of my mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnnd that\\'s it\\nIf you read all of this, thanks a lot.

What was beyond the Vindhyas was defined by Indo European migrations( First by the primary Indo Europeans - Originators of contemporary Hinduism) and later followed by Kushans, Scythians and others. However, One would assume that these movements were of noo consequence to the Southerners for a very long period of time.I would like to discuss about this era.However, after a period of Indo European expansion, Hindi Sanskrit IE influence starting streaming down South, where Southern Chieftans took sides and assistance in a game of one-upmanship.\\n\\nSo, basically we have two Proto Dravidian Kingly lines, possibly from the same families who rule the West(Cheras, now Kerala) and East(Cholas, Chennai, or Tamil Nadu). It is interesting to note that the Cholas took Brahminical help when it came to Metaphysics, especially the Shiva -Vishnu combine(Hari Hara), their Children and extended families for a small example. Its well known that Raja Raja Chola became a Hindu inspired by a Hindu priest( Elite migration into the protected South?) and went on to build huge monuments, usually at the expense of the Tamil locals becoming stone labourers. \\n\\nIts also interesting to note that the Chera Kings  discouraged Hinduism(Swadharma System- propogated in the Gita or Vedic Varnshrama). They had preferred the Assyrians , and Babylonian Traders for Metal Working upgrades and shared Metaphysical Concepts from them.I believe that due to this reason the Hindu epics refer to Kerala Kings as Asuras, who had Shukra(Pleasure instead of Asceticism) for a teacher.\\n\\nThe Cheras(Asuras in another sense) with Kings such as Mahabali, Ravana(Ra- Sun, Vana - Sky - Basically a Title) were defeated(Or Land Restricted) after a long Hindu campaign over thousands of years.This involved military activity(Parashuram), population tactics(Vishnu Vamana as the Dwarf Brahmin), Krishna vs Kamsa(Note Kamsas real father was a Rakshasa), Rama vs Ravana (Whatever might be the reasons).\\n\\nAnd by the end of the campaigns we see that the real Cheras are displaced by the fake Cheras. We can see the second Chera dynasty having Sanskrit names like  Verma, Rama, Ravi instead of the First Chera Malayala names such as Nedum Cheralathan, Uthiyan etc.However they are not finished yet, we see a particular group of socialists in Kerala seize the Central Heartland (they are a mix of native+west semitic, native Assyrian-Babylonian, Native Arab Children) and the new Chera Kings are forced South into Travancore, Feudal Warriors(Native Chekavars)  Seize Northern Kerala and the Hindu Kings(Zamorin) is restricted to the Extreme North.So, we can see that the First Cheras become feudal landlords for a period of time and then later displace the second Cheras and the first Cheras re-emerge  and Brahminism was eventually banned in recent times and Kerala is a communist state till now with Cow Slaughter not only permissible, but encouraged for meat eating practices, usually along with a serving of fresh toddy.

I am somebody who is a fan of science, although I'm not exactly smart in it all, and interlink the two to enjoy the best of both.\\n\\nNow, when things go wrong for me/people I care about, I turned to faith or had the belief it was there for me if I needed it. But since the turn of the year, my luck has been so crap its unreal. I have had several interviews at big companies I've dreamed of and one which strung me along for months and then got turned down for cos I gave too much info in the presentation to them. And that one hurt because that was my number one company (no company does anything similar to them) offering me everything I wanted. I went into a period of serious depression which I have not really come out of I guess, but went on and got more interviews at other top companies. Turned down from all for one reason or another. \\n\\nWhilst that sounds 'woe is me' tale, it made me think about life more. I realised my parents have been getting shat on for years. My father who's only crime was being too kind to people (brothers and friends) got trampled on by them for their selfish needs and then he ended up having a transplant several years ago (for the record, he never drank or anything so it came from nowhere but stress was the main cause according to doctors). Life can only get better right? No. Nothing has improved in their luck and still getting crap coming in from every direction. What did they do? They pray, they are religious, they help people in need at their expense if they need to. Yet all the people who have been dicks and then some have gone on to be rich and happy knowing they are untouchable now. And as you may have guessed, when my dad was in hospital and since they all acted like they gave a shit.

This is not just, to give people absolutely no chance is a cruel game.\\n\\nI am not saying I want everything in the world even though it would be nice, but why are there people in the world constantly getting screwed over or have no chance even though they try and do good by people, yet people who seem to do nothing but screw people over get everything?\\n\\n**Tl:dr - Is there much point in keeping faith when it doesn't seem to make one bit of difference?**\\n\\n*EDIT: I forgot to add, the reason I still can't fully shake the faith I have left is because of the things I've seen I guess. Without wanting to come across as a psycho if I haven't already, its cos of strange things that have happened to people who I trust with my life and they have no reason to lie.

I guess what I expect from religion is a better meaning of what the overall goals of life should be. Also I believe creating good karma can eventually increase your chances of better outcomes in this life but also in the many lives ahead so it does not necessarily mean you will reap the benefits in this lifetime.

In a prison, if the prisoner prays to the jailer every day asking to be let out, will he be let out? The most the jailer can do is provide him some extra food now and then. But the law of the country controls when he will be released from the prison after having atoned for his mistakes.\\n\\nIn a similar way, we the embodied souls in this material world are undergoing a type of justice - not just punishment - for our past actions in this world. We have done both good and bad actions, and as such are being rewarded and punished accordingly. After having completed those good and bad actions, and having been situated in this present birth as a consequence, we feel that by praying to various devas we should be freed from the responsibilities of our past actions. Just like the prisoner praying to the jail warden to be released from the prison. Neither the prisoner will be released, nor will we be freed from our responsibilities created by our past actions.\\n\\nHow would people feel if a murderer was released from a prison, just because he flattered the warden? Everyone would be angry that a great injustice has been committed. The same injustice would be committed if we expected our due fate to be removed by devas for our praising them.\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita doesn\\'t teach us that we will get lots of money, property, fame, women and happiness by worshiping God. Krishna\\'s tells us rather to tolerate both happiness and distress equally. Everyone is willing to \"tolerate\" the happiness, but no one is willing to tolerate the sufferings. Both are our own justice being served to us, and both we have to go through, just as we have to go through the summer and winter seasons each year.  As we tolerate the heat in summer, and tolerate the cold in winter, in the same way Krishna tells us to tolerate the happiness and distress when they come based on our past karma.\\n\\nIn the Bhagavad Gita (2.14) Krishna says:\\n\\nmatra-sparsas tu kaunteya\\nsitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah\\nagamapayino \\'nityas\\ntams titiksasva bharata\\n\\n\"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons.

He just couldn't understand how a bunch of Right & just people who had done no harm to others were sent to the forests and suffer whereas the evil Kauravas & their friends were enjoying their lives in Palaces.\\n    He used to discuss this with the Rishis in the forests and it was then that they told the narrated of Nala & Damayanti, Harishchandra etc to console him. The purpose was exactly to say that a period of misfortune happens in everybody's lives. Its not that they were chosen specifically for this misery by some evil plan.

Cheers.\", 'your thoughts on the portrayal of Krishna in Shin Megami Tensei IV: ApocalypseI presume most of you aren\\'t familiar with the video game series: shin megami tensei (smt for short). To sum it up it\\'s a long-running jrpg series that is usually set in an apocalyptic setting and revolves around ideological conflict, this includes:\\n\\n1. The law side which fights for order and archives to create a socialist utopia represented by the judeo-christian angels\\n\\n2. It\\'s opposition, the Chaos faction that strives to create a dystopian anarchy so \"only the strong can survive\" and limitless freedom can be accomplished that is represented by the judeo-christian fallen angels/demons\\n\\n3. and the neutral side which denounces both so humanity can follow the best of both sides, which results in it being unstable and suseptable to more ideological wars, and is represented by humans and sometimes even random pagan gods and goddesses.\\n\\nNow, some of you may be familiar to [this little controversy](http://nichegamer.com/2016/02/03/hindus-are-pissed-that-krishna-is-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final/) that happened over a year ago (i\\'m not sure how repeatable the source is, so take it with a grain of salt), which actually inspired me to write this post so i can present what krishna is in-game to those not familiar with it. To begin, i\\'ll just say he\\'s more than just a summonable ally, he plays a major role in the story actually.\\n\\nnow that i\\'ve quickly boiled down the basics of the series, maybe you are wondering what that role in the latest game is. Well, i can\\'t really do this without spoiling the game\\'s plot, but here i go: after he is unsealed he preaches about how yahweh trapped souls into the material realm so they are forced to cling to him via the circle of law-chaos (i could go more into detail, but that\\'d make this post a lot longer than it already is). Krishna\\'s plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy. But no such luck with Krishna, he\\'s simply a forced antagonist who you can\\'t side with.\\n\\nand the last thing i will talk about, the character design: now, [his regular form](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/8/8d/SMT_IV_FINAL_Krishna.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025173647) is a pretty good design personally, and along with being very expressive it does a good job conveying his charming, calm but also snarky and sometimes sarcastic. i\\'m not sure whether i\\'d say \"that\\'s Krishna\" the first time i saw his design, but he definitely feels like krishna when i look at him (at least to me)\\n\\nBut his [vishnu](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_B_SMT4A.jpg) [designs](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_II_SMTIVA_Official_Art.jpg) seem to go more with the forced antagonist role he plays in the story; maybe the design is referencing something i don\\'t know, but with the \"nandakas\" in the second form that really look more like lightsabers, i can\\'t help but to look at vishnu and think \"what is he, a sith lord?\" Kinda discredits him as a god of preservation when his design seems to just say *evil*\\n\\nSo that about wraps it up, but as a note i should say that my goal is not to upset or get anyone offended with this post. i\\'m just curious to see what this community thinks of Krishna\\'s whole portrayal in this game. is it faithful to his origins or not? is this offensive or are these just silly video games that shouldn\\'t be taken seriously?

It\\'s like your breath: it goes in and out, in and out, and if you try to hold it in all the time you feel terrible.

But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself. He pretends that he is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, all the plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when he wakes up they will disappear.\\n\\n\"Now when God plays hide and pretends that he is you and I, he does it so well that it takes him a long time to remember where and how he hid himself. But that\\'s the whole fun of it—just what he wanted to do. He doesn\\'t want to find himself too quickly, for that would spoil the game. That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be himself. But when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will wake up, stop pretending, and remember that we are all one single Self—the God who is all that there is and who lives for ever and ever.\\n\\n\"Of course, you must remember that God isn\\'t shaped like a person. People have skins and there is always something outside our skins. If there weren\\'t, we wouldn\\'t know the difference between what is inside and outside our bodies. But God has no skin and no shape because there isn\\'t any outside to him. [With a sufficiently intelligent child, I illustrate this with a Möbius strip—a ring of paper tape twisted once in such a way that it has only one side and one edge.] The inside and the outside of God are the same. And though I have been talking about God as \\'he\\' and not \\'she,\\' God isn\\'t a man or a woman. I didn\\'t say \\'it\\' because we usually say \\'it\\' for things that aren\\'t alive.\\n\\n\"God is the Self of the world, but you can\\'t see God for the same reason that, without a mirror, you can\\'t see your own eyes, and you certainly can\\'t bite your own teeth or look inside your head. Your self is that cleverly hidden because it is God hiding.\\n\\n\"You may ask why God sometimes hides in the form of horrible people, or pretends to be people who suffer great disease and pain. Remember, first, that he isn\\'t really doing this to anyone but himself. Remember, too, that in almost all the stories you enjoy there have to be bad people as well as good people, for the thrill of the tale is to find out how the good people will get the better of the bad. It\\'s the same as when we play cards. At the beginning of the game we shuffle them all into a mess, which is like the bad things in the world, but the point of the game is to put the mess into good order, and the one who does it best is the winner. Then we shuffle the cards once more and play again, and so it goes with the world.\"\\n\\nThis story, obviously mythical in form, is not given as a scientific description of the way things are. Based on the analogies of games and the drama, and using that much worn-out word \"God\" for the Player, the story claims only to be like the way things are. I use it just as astronomers use the image of inflating a black balloon with white spots on it for the galaxies, to explain the expanding universe. But to most children, and many adults, the myth is at once intelligible, simple, and fascinating. By contrast, so many other mythical explanations of the world are crude, tortuous, and unintelligible. But many people think that believing in the unintelligible propositions and symbols of their religions is the test of true faith. \"I believe,\" said Tertullian of Christianity, \"because it is absurd.\"', \"Oh great, Alan Watts.

Practices are aimed at material well being or of a 'spiritual' nature(more precisely, to free up one's conditioning and to get out of repetitive cycles of behaviour).

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \\n\\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \\n\\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\\n\\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\\n\\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\\n\\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \\n\\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*', 'The Symbolism of Ganesh ChaturthiIt is pitiable to depict Lord Ganapati [Ganesha] with the head of the elephant and offer Him grass and leaves, treating Him as an animal. \\n\\nThe story itself is absurd because is says that Lord Shiva cuts the head of Ganapati. It is said that Lord Shiva was ignorant of Ganapati, who was brought to life as the son of Goddess Parvati. How ignorant is this fabrication! \\n\\nLord Shiva is said to be the deity of Knowledge (Jnanam Maheswaraat). He is Sarvajna or omniscient. Is such a story not insulting to Lord Shiva, who is the ultimate Lord? \\n\\nGanapati means the Lord of the devotees of His innermost circle, who are liberated souls. He is the ultimate Lord who comes down to this earth in human form to play with His devotees here. Ignorance is at its maximum on earth and therefore this world is an excellent playground for His divine play or game. \\n\\nHe comes down along with the devotees belonging to His innermost circle called as Gana (Kridayantam aharnisham—Shankara). This story can be likened to a boy who calls his closest friends to play a game or a person who goes to see and enjoy a cinema along with his family members. \\n\\nThe ultimate Parabrahman, who descends down in the human form along with His innermost devotees, for the divine play on this earth is Ganapati (Gananaantva—Veda). \\n\\nWhat is the meaning of the elephant-head? It means the nature of an elephant.\\n\\nThe head represents the intelligence or Buddhi of an elephant and not the head of the elephant physically. We scold a stupid person and call him a donkey. It means that his inner nature is like that of the donkey and not his physical form.\\n\\nWhat is the nature of an elephant? It is said “Gajaana mati Bhirutvam’, which means that the elephant has enormous strength but it forgets its own strength and is always afraid of everything. Similarly, when the Lord comes down, He imposes ignorance on Himself to enjoy the role. The actor should forget himself in the role if he wants to fully enjoy his character. Therefore, the Lord forgets His divine strength and acts like a Jeeva (soul), fearing the onslaught of troubles in this world.\\n\\nThe Veda says that fear is a characteristic of the limited soul (Atha tasya Bhayam Bhavati). Only by being fearful can the Lord fully enjoy and also do full justice to the role.\\n\\nIt is said that Goddess Parvati prepared the body of Ganapati and also introduced life into it. This statement has an inner spiritual meaning. Goddess Parvati represents Maya. When the Lord incarnates in this world, Maya prepares the human body and also introduces life, which is Para Prakriti, into it.\\n\\nTherefore, life or awareness is only a part of creation and is not Parabrahman. \\n\\nGanapati also shows five faces like Shiva. This indicates that Parabrahman indicated by the word Shiva has entered the human body. Ganapati is said to be the husband of Siddhi and Buddhi. Siddhi and Buddhi are not two ladies although they are symbolically shown to be so. \\n\\nBuddhi means knowledge associated with logical analysis. Siddhi means attainment. You have to attain the Lord in human form, who is the Satguru by logical analysis, so that you can eliminate fraud preachers. Siddhi means the attainment of the Lord in human form.\\n\\nYou should take the inner sense of Lord Ganesha’s story, which alone is the truth.\\n\\nScholars explain the concept in a symbolic language for the sake of illiterate and ignorant people. \\n\\nGanapati is said to be very brave, having stood against even Lord Shiva. This means that when the Lord is with full knowledge in His original form, He is fully aware of His divine strength. But when the head of Ganapati is replaced by the head of an elephant, He forgot all his divine strength and was afraid of everything. \\n\\nThis is a symbolic story. \\n\\nThe actual meaning is that the Lord in his original form is fully aware of Himself and His power. But when he comes down in human form, He forgets His divine strength and fears like an ordinary soul. This gives full enjoyment to the Lord in the human role. \\n\\nThe vehicle of the huge Ganapati is a small rat. This means that when you enter the service of the Lord, you need not think about your capacity to serve Him. By the will and power of the Lord, you’ll gain the capability to serve Him. You are just an external instrument and the Lord wants to give you divine fame. \\n\\nThe small rat carries the huge Ganapati and this is not due to the strength of the rat. It is only by the power of Ganapati that the small rat carries Him.\\n\\nIf you want to read more, you can find the original text can be found at:\\n\\nhttp://www.universal-spirituality.org/downloads/DivineDiscourses-3.pdf (page 6 onward)', \"Hi!

Hence, karma is also beginningless. There was no \"first\" point in time according to Dharmic philosophies.\\n\\n>Hinduism is not like Christianity or Islam who think that there is an absolute \"good\" and absolute \"evil\".\\n\\nChristianity and Islam, if this is what they hold, then fall prey to the following well-known dilemma:\\n\\nIs something good because Allah/Yahweh say so? Or did Allah/Yahweh say something was good and something else was bad because good/bad existed before Allah/Yahweh said so. Neither of these horns are rather welcome given Christianity and Islam\\'s insistence on creatio ex nihilo.', 'Doctrine of karma as described in mahabharatha by  draupadi to yudhistira states that a person\\'s immediate future is determined by\\n\\n1. Chance\\n2. Unforeseen consequences of past actions(samskara/adrsta phala)\\n3. Immediate consequences of current actions(drsta phala)\\n4. There is no fourth\\n\\n>1. Did brahma create n number of souls when he created our universe?\\n\\n Atman are neither created nor destroyed. \\n\\n>2. Was \\'0\\' karma alloted to each soul?\\n\\nAtman is beyond karma. If you are a jaina then the atman gets veiled by karma which clings to it as dirt. You can assign a 0 to this primordial state.\\n\\n>3. I was told that my soul chose my body because it that that it is now able to handle the difficulties. Does that mean more difficult life = more karma? If it is about the experience, there are infinite way a soul can experience difficulties in different ways. Won\\'t that be considered as an opportunity cost?\\n\\nAt every birth - an amount of karma is randomly  allocated from your karma backlog. This karma is called prarabdha and it contains both karma with beneficial consequences/phala and those with antagonistic consequences. Depending on the relative ratio - your life would vary from super easy mode to hell difficulty.\\n\\n\\n>4. Is it like a video game? Collect n number of karma to go to swarga, x for vaikuntha etc.?\\n\\nDepends on the denomination. Your good actions doesn\\'t override the bad ones. You go to swarga to enjoy the rewards that weren\\'t adequately rewarded and you go to naraka to get punished for that which were not adequately punished. Another interpretation  is that swarga is life on the world in super easy mode where you get everything for little effort and naraka is life on earth in hell mode where the world is out to screw you.\\n\\n>5. Who decides good or bad karma? Hinduism is not like Christianity or Islam who think that there is an absolute \"good\" and absolute \"evil\".\\n\\nAll actions have consequences. Beneficial vs Antagonistic is more appropriatethan good vs bad in my opinion. Causality doesn\\'t necessarily need an ishvara - so answer varies with denomination \\n\\n\\n>6. How does my karma up till now affect my current life?\\n\\nIt affects by determining the difficulty for every task and prunes the game tree accordingly. Now let us say you want to give an exam - if you have very good prarabdha then you can score 100 by studying the night before exam. If your prarabdha is very negative then you may barely pass by studying very hard throughout the year. \\n\\n\\n>7. As I mentioned earlier, according someone on this sub, my soul chose this body to experience something. So is that soul bound to choose from certain bodies whose lives will be somewhat similar (according to their astrology, which I assume the soul knows how to read). Bound to choose from a set of bodies whose life paths and the soul\\'s karma match?\\n\\n In samkhya yes the Purusha gets entangled with a body to experience something. This is a divine mystery. Atleast the samkhya school believes it is the prakriti not the Purusha that determines what the body should be depending on all that the Purusha has experienced to give the purusha a more comprehensive experience so the atma doesn\\'t exactly choose a body.', \"There will be varying answers, so take all with a grain of salt.

Maya in simple terms is defined as space, time and causation. All the objective quantities in the universe which we can perceive through our senses and mind (in the form of thoughts, beliefs, etc) all come under Maya. Within maya, one objective quantity can be simplified and explained in terms of other objective quantity.  In particular, all your questions regarding karma are of this type.\\n\\nBut all of maya is just an appearance of the ultimate truth; Atman(which is very loosely translated as soul, whose meaning varies from context to context), which encompasses all the objective happenings in maya. The Atman is not an object, rather, it is that which illumines every objective experience in maya. Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya.

The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis. Many of them go this way because, they cannot just simply accept what someone tells them, they need to see it, feel it, make it, experience it and realise and understand it themselves. A fervent need for intellectual stimulation. \\n\\nFor someone like this, is Bhakti yoga really viable ? are Bhakti and jnana from a broad perspective just diametrically opposite to one another?  On a simplistic level, the Bhakti yogi is less likely to question things as the jnana yogi is to accept things as is. \\n\\nAre these two things opposed to the other? What does reconciliation of these two really mean, does it mean you give up on one of the paths ? What prevents the jnana yogi from being able to surrender, is it the ego ? the notion of  \"I have to know, I have to find out\" ? I\\'d love to hear your thoughts on this.', '[deleted]', '\"The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation\"  \\n\\n\\nLmao what a joke xD', 'A great path for those who make the mind reflective and pure.

Making the mind pure and clear with truths is a fine path.', 'Monk Academy&#x200B;\\n\\nI am an twenty-year-old full-time monk (brahmacari) living in our monastery in upstate NY. My name is Tirtha. I joined the temple a year ago and my life has completely transformed. Before coming here I was a confused young boy, who had just finished school. I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.). But by the mercy of my teachers, I was able to transform my life and become a better person. Although I have just started my path. I can confidently say that my life is meaningful and it has a deep purpose. I am happy, therefore I want to share this opportunity with others.\\n\\nBrahmacharya is a life of a monk, it\\'s a commitment to restrict oneself from sense gratification, and focus on your spiritual growth. Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek. There is a beautiful lake right next to us and breathtaking waterfalls just a few minutes away. It is a peaceful, quiet, and relaxing environment that is perfect for our spiritual practice.\\n\\nThis is exactly what we are doing in our ashram (temple). We are training young men (from 18 years old) to become strong, responsible individuals in our society. We are studying Vedic scriptures, under the guidance of our teacher Rasik Mohan Prabhu who is a lifelong monk, and who lived in a monastery in India for 16 years of his life. Every day we are practicing yoga and meditation. We also have a lot of service (seva) to do. Our project started only a year and a half ago. We have a lot of things to do and we are also open to new possibilities.\\n\\nWe are also learning many different arts and skills such as yoga, meditation, visualization, construction, painting, building, gardening, book publication, writing, singing, artistic skills, memorizing verses, studying different scriptures, public speaking, and many other things.\\n\\nSo as a resident of the monastery I am inviting every young man who is interested to come and learn how to think like a monk, and most importantly how to live like a monk.\\n\\nIf you are interested or have any questions you can write here or contact me: brotherhoodofmonks@gmail.com\\n\\nNamaste,\\n\\nTirtha', 'Am I correct in understanding that you belong to the gauDIya vaiShNava sampradAya but not to ISKCON?', 'I wish more young people would take up monkhood in a traditional way.', 'Today I saw a short video on youtube about Shiva being played in a game.

For a time we identify with the roles being played as real characters (when in reality they are just actors).\\n\\nAren't we into the role of our self (lower-case 's') right now and can't we enjoy expansion of that self in love and being free?\", 'Much of this confusion is due to promiscuous usage of language. Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point. Till we attain moksha which is the same as realizing that we are eternally Brahman, the normal rules of morality, human ends, meaning etc all apply. \\n\\nTo give an example, we all know that the world is made of fundamental particles of various kinds. However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels.

Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing.

So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings.

Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives.

Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan.

Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes. This then to us regular ppl appears as someone having a really really sh\\\\*tty life full of misery, suffering, etc. SO Karma indeed is the answer but there are nuances within that as well.', \"4. The creature experiencing the evil is an incarnation of God, taking on the pain for some reason that will be known later.\\n\\nExample: the Ramayana\\n\\nAlso, I don't really consider 2 or 3 to be reasons for evil to exist. They are just incidental side effects of 1: Karma.\", \"I would argue that a omnibenevelant God would do bad in the interest of good by helping us grow through suffering. As demonstrated by yin and yan, there is good in bad and bad in good. So I would extend your reincarnation point to growth within a single life, as well as over multiple life times.\\n\\nThe point of good and evil being illusionary is interesting. I understand its called illusionary as we as humans conceptualise everything and as we do our definitions are out of touch with the way things are, it's not actually saying that these things don't exist. This teaching is only calling for a deeper understanding into reality, such as, can evil be classed as inheriently bad if its nessesary for good to exist?\", \"I've never heard of this 'well known' argument.

This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe).

Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality\\n\\nSo literally doing anything at all goes against non-duality? In which case, Shankara who wrote volumes of literature and spent his entire life debating people would also be pretty non-advaitic. You sound like some edgy nihilist who just discovered buddhism.\\n\\n\\nThe brahman maybe formless but it's not some dead and static inertia where literally nothing happens.

To sum it up it\\'s a long-running jrpg series that is usually set in an apocalyptic setting and revolves around ideological conflict, this includes:\\n\\n1. The law side which fights for order and archives to create a socialist utopia represented by the judeo-christian angels\\n\\n2. It\\'s opposition, the Chaos faction that strives to create a dystopian anarchy so \"only the strong can survive\" and limitless freedom can be accomplished that is represented by the judeo-christian fallen angels/demons\\n\\n3. and the neutral side which denounces both so humanity can follow the best of both sides, which results in it being unstable and suseptable to more ideological wars, and is represented by humans and sometimes even random pagan gods and goddesses.\\n\\nNow, some of you may be familiar to [this little controversy](http://nichegamer.com/2016/02/03/hindus-are-pissed-that-krishna-is-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final/) that happened over a year ago (i\\'m not sure how repeatable the source is, so take it with a grain of salt), which actually inspired me to write this post so i can present what krishna is in-game to those not familiar with it. To begin, i\\'ll just say he\\'s more than just a summonable ally, he plays a major role in the story actually.\\n\\nnow that i\\'ve quickly boiled down the basics of the series, maybe you are wondering what that role in the latest game is. Well, i can\\'t really do this without spoiling the game\\'s plot, but here i go: after he is unsealed he preaches about how yahweh trapped souls into the material realm so they are forced to cling to him via the circle of law-chaos (i could go more into detail, but that\\'d make this post a lot longer than it already is). Krishna\\'s plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy. But no such luck with Krishna, he\\'s simply a forced antagonist who you can\\'t side with.\\n\\nand the last thing i will talk about, the character design: now, [his regular form](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/8/8d/SMT_IV_FINAL_Krishna.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025173647) is a pretty good design personally, and along with being very expressive it does a good job conveying his charming, calm but also snarky and sometimes sarcastic. i\\'m not sure whether i\\'d say \"that\\'s Krishna\" the first time i saw his design, but he definitely feels like krishna when i look at him (at least to me)\\n\\nBut his [vishnu](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_B_SMT4A.jpg) [designs](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_II_SMTIVA_Official_Art.jpg) seem to go more with the forced antagonist role he plays in the story; maybe the design is referencing something i don\\'t know, but with the \"nandakas\" in the second form that really look more like lightsabers, i can\\'t help but to look at vishnu and think \"what is he, a sith lord?\" Kinda discredits him as a god of preservation when his design seems to just say *evil*\\n\\nSo that about wraps it up, but as a note i should say that my goal is not to upset or get anyone offended with this post. i\\'m just curious to see what this community thinks of Krishna\\'s whole portrayal in this game. is it faithful to his origins or not? is this offensive or are these just silly video games that shouldn\\'t be taken seriously?

I am enchanted.', '[deleted]', 'Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism# Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism\\n\\nsource: paraphrased from several talks by Swami Paramarthananda.\\n\\nThere is a lot of confusion around the necessity and role of Vedas and guru in Hinduism.  These are some common questions that people have.\\n\\n1. Why do I need to study the Vedas?\\n2. Is a guru really necessary?\\n3. Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\\n\\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\\n\\n>tadviddhi praṇipātēna paripraśnēna sēvayā |  \\n>  \\n>upadēkṣyanti tē jñānaṁ jñāninastattvadarśinaḥ || 4.34||  \\n>  \\n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus? How do know that am not a guru?', '[deleted]', 'Very great post, and finding a Guru is one of the most valuable steps a seeker can take.\\n\\nAn important point is to not to treat acceptance of a guru casually and make a quick decision(something which happens a lot these days, sometimes followed by regrets). This is much more important than even something like marriage, and it is not considered good to leave and accept another person as Guru.  The student is usually encourage to spend some time testing and only when convinced at heart,  to commit to someone as Guru and be fully dedicated to their teachings.\\n\\nAlso, we need more guidance about sadhanas that somebody who hasnt yet found their Guru can do, how to find sadhanas which get you close to the Guru principle/tattva,  like Guru Gita, stotras to Dattatreya or Dakshinamurty,', 'Thank you for writing!', 'Indeed satsang (company of learned people) is very helpful.

Those who live by these four attain happiness irrespective of what race, religion,ethnicity, region, gender you belong.  \\n', 'Hinduism isn\\'t one religion. it\\'s more of an umbrella term. you see, when the Persians first invaded India, they referred to people in the valley on the other side of the Indus River as \"Hindus\". later, when other groups came into contact with the Indian subcontinent, they referred to the religious practices of the people there as \"Hindu religion\". these people had various different beliefs, practices, gods, and so on, including the Brahman religion as well as many others. it wans\\'t until after the colonization of India by the British Empire, and the subsequent call for an Independent India (then called Hindustan), that the people there really began to form the idea of a united Hinduism. \\n\\nHinduism, as a term, is a recognized world religion, but it still encompasses many different religions and schools of philosophy. there are the Vaishnavas who believe that Vishnu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead; there are the Shaivites who believe it is Shiva who is Supreme Personality of God; there are the Shaktas who believe Shakti is the Supreme Personality, with different schools believing that it is either her form Kali or her form Devi; and there are Smartists who believe that there is no single Supreme Personality, and that each person chooses their own God to be representative personality of God to them.\\n\\nthere are Hindu schools of thought that claim God is singular and manifests in many incarnations as the other gods and demigods; there are those who believe that God is entirely impersonal and exists in all things and is synonymous with the Universe; there are those who believe that there is one Supreme God and many lesser gods beneath him.\\n\\nsome believe that your station in life (everything from your financial status, to your caste if any, to your species) depends on you karma from your previous life. if you were evil or sinful then you will be born into a lower station or even as an animal, bird or reptile, insect, plant, or even a rock. these people believe that only humans have free will and responsibility and can sense God; others believe that you can reincarnate into various species with no rhyme or reason, and that your social station is not entirely based on your karma from a previous life, but can be changed in this life through good works.\\n\\nthe common ultimate goal of all Hindus is generally to achieve Moksha and end the cycle of reincarnation. this is interpreted differently for each Hindu. some believe that you go to a sort of Paradise lke Heaven. some believe that you join with God and lose all Ego and sense of individual identity. some believe that Moksha is like Nirvana and you are simply enlightened and don\\'t have to die to enjoy the bliss that comes with it. however, there are even a few Hindus who believe that ending the cycle of Samsara is selfish, and instead seek to merely Love and give eternal devotion to God. I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house. I have come to Hinduism after a long exploration of other religions since my teens. ', \"Hinduism is difficult to understand in few short paras or even book. For example, many hindus will refute your claim about it being polytheistic, stating all those gods/demi-gods etc are just manifestation of one power which is formless and attribute-less (some hindus will claim one god but with attribute and form instead). Coming from abrahamic religions, people get confused with not-so-well-defined aspects of Hinduism, so I recommend reading some publications from Hinduism Today which clarifies Hinduism in detail. http://www.hinduismtoday.com \\n\\nAdding to /u/storytimesover response -\\nSwastika - considered auspicious among Hindus, still used a lot even though world sees it differently. This documentary might be of help - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbeYIBT9XVc\\n\\nGanesha - considered to be God of wisdom and remover of obstacles (that's why you'll ganesha idol in majority of cars owned by Hindus). May be this might help although it's a long read - http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1366. Google will show many more perspective of Ganesha. \\n\\nWeird rules - depends on perspective\\n\\nMeaning of life - that question is essence of Hinduism, not the god/deities/rituals/rules. Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred. Offer your food to the god you wish to please (offering to Krishna pleases all the gods).\\n\\nReincarnation: Your next vessel is a result of the karma (action) of this life and previous lives. You can overcome reincarnation by returning to Godhead/Krishnaloka/Vaikuntha.\\n\\nThe meaning of life, in my opinion, is to live for Krishna and create a better world for all living entities.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha. So end of Mahabharata brings about a change not just in the rulers of Hatinapur but gave a new direction to the entire the then future of India wherein not just a new power  arose to rule but also a different philosophy which was Non-Vedic in nature gained prominence.

Reading the spark note esk back story on the devas made we want to look up and learn more about them and what they represent. I was an athiest for several and had tried other religions and philosophies before as I've stated before , without feeling the tiniest sliver of anything. Then after reading the Mahabharata and the Ramayana I prayed for a sign that this was the proper path for me and was answered! And now I'm way happier than I ever was with anything else and I owe it all to Smite getting that going.

One is supposed to approach him through devotion alone.\\n\\nDo you see the contrast between this and when he is a 'cool' character in a video game and does 'cool' stuff. Though Rama is the main figure in Ramayana, he is not a character from a book. He is viewed by many as God who is to be revered, to be worshipped. Hence the perceived offence.\\n\\nThat aside, Hindu gods do have a ton of qualities that make them nice video game material. And personally, I kind of agree with the  company president's statement.

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \\n\\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \\n\\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\\n\\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\\n\\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\\n\\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \\n\\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*']\n",

Unwholesome thoughts prime us/increase the likelihood of us to commit unwholesome actions that would then result in paap.\\n\\nI believe the effect of violent video games on human psyche  is a subject of active academic research. Current research is non conclusive in either direction if I remember correctly. Virtual world might offer an alternate avenue to relieve stress hence making said individual more unlikely to commit real world aggression but this doesn't say anything about if that individual is experiencing an overall uptick in aggressive impulses which he/she then satisfies via more gaming. You can read more about them in their respective websites/articles etc. You can also look into studies that investigate how pornography and the type of pornography affects the psyche and if this is correlated with rape crimes. I believe the underlying mechanisms should be similar for all these virtual stimuli.\", 'Dear u/Procambara, \\n\\nI saved this question and took me a couple of days of reasoning out in the back of my brain to finally answer. \\n\\nHow do you define “killing” of something that has no life to begin with? \\n\\nMake a shape of a human in a block of wood. \\nNow casts it into the fire. \\n\\nDid you kill it? \\nNo. Because it’s just “wood”. \\nMaybe you could argue you killed “wood” but not a man, that is, the shape of a man into the wood. \\n\\nKilling a virtual character is not different. \\nYou can’t kill something that had no life to being with, it’s like throwing a block of wood into the fire. \\n\\nWe define killing of a virtual character based on some false information we got; the character is made to emulate a real living being while it carries absolutely no life in it. \\nIf you installed a set of mechanisms inside the block of wood and made it walk; do you consider it alive? \\n\\nNow let us see the killer instead. \\n\\nThere’s no killing at all because even the killer is not alive. \\nYou control another piece of wood that cast another into fire; let’s call it piece K for Killer and piece V for victim. \\n\\nDid K just kill V? None of them has any life into it. \\nYou are just interacting with nothing more than logs of wood.\\n\\nTo define “killing” a living entity must be present and must be defined as the killer; another living being instead will be called the victim. \\nWithout one of these no killing is possible. \\n\\nIt’s how we define killing that shapes the actions and therefore Karma. \\nAssuming a virtual character has life in it is just a mistake based on a “simulated liveness” which of course is nothing more than a mere illusion. \\n\\nPeace.', 'want to know all about karma1.

If it is about the experience, there are infinite way a soul can experience difficulties in different ways. Won\\'t that be considered as an opportunity cost?\\n\\nAt every birth - an amount of karma is randomly  allocated from your karma backlog. This karma is called prarabdha and it contains both karma with beneficial consequences/phala and those with antagonistic consequences. Depending on the relative ratio - your life would vary from super easy mode to hell difficulty.\\n\\n\\n>4. Is it like a video game? Collect n number of karma to go to swarga, x for vaikuntha etc.?\\n\\nDepends on the denomination. Your good actions doesn\\'t override the bad ones. You go to swarga to enjoy the rewards that weren\\'t adequately rewarded and you go to naraka to get punished for that which were not adequately punished. Another interpretation  is that swarga is life on the world in super easy mode where you get everything for little effort and naraka is life on earth in hell mode where the world is out to screw you.\\n\\n>5. Who decides good or bad karma? Hinduism is not like Christianity or Islam who think that there is an absolute \"good\" and absolute \"evil\".\\n\\nAll actions have consequences. Beneficial vs Antagonistic is more appropriatethan good vs bad in my opinion. Causality doesn\\'t necessarily need an ishvara - so answer varies with denomination \\n\\n\\n>6. How does my karma up till now affect my current life?\\n\\nIt affects by determining the difficulty for every task and prunes the game tree accordingly. Now let us say you want to give an exam - if you have very good prarabdha then you can score 100 by studying the night before exam. If your prarabdha is very negative then you may barely pass by studying very hard throughout the year. \\n\\n\\n>7.

So is that soul bound to choose from certain bodies whose lives will be somewhat similar (according to their astrology, which I assume the soul knows how to read). Bound to choose from a set of bodies whose life paths and the soul\\'s karma match?\\n\\n In samkhya yes the Purusha gets entangled with a body to experience something. This is a divine mystery. Atleast the samkhya school believes it is the prakriti not the Purusha that determines what the body should be depending on all that the Purusha has experienced to give the purusha a more comprehensive experience so the atma doesn\\'t exactly choose a body.', \"There will be varying answers, so take all with a grain of salt.

Maya in simple terms is defined as space, time and causation. All the objective quantities in the universe which we can perceive through our senses and mind (in the form of thoughts, beliefs, etc) all come under Maya. Within maya, one objective quantity can be simplified and explained in terms of other objective quantity.  In particular, all your questions regarding karma are of this type.\\n\\nBut all of maya is just an appearance of the ultimate truth; Atman(which is very loosely translated as soul, whose meaning varies from context to context), which encompasses all the objective happenings in maya. The Atman is not an object, rather, it is that which illumines every objective experience in maya. Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya. Try to go beyond Maya — break free the bondage by associating our self with body and mind.', 'I started a series on this exact topic.

My name is Tirtha. I joined the temple a year ago and my life has completely transformed. Before coming here I was a confused young boy, who had just finished school. I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.). But by the mercy of my teachers, I was able to transform my life and become a better person. Although I have just started my path. I can confidently say that my life is meaningful and it has a deep purpose. I am happy, therefore I want to share this opportunity with others.\\n\\nBrahmacharya is a life of a monk, it\\'s a commitment to restrict oneself from sense gratification, and focus on your spiritual growth. Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek. There is a beautiful lake right next to us and breathtaking waterfalls just a few minutes away. It is a peaceful, quiet, and relaxing environment that is perfect for our spiritual practice.\\n\\nThis is exactly what we are doing in our ashram (temple). We are training young men (from 18 years old) to become strong, responsible individuals in our society. We are studying Vedic scriptures, under the guidance of our teacher Rasik Mohan Prabhu who is a lifelong monk, and who lived in a monastery in India for 16 years of his life. Every day we are practicing yoga and meditation. We also have a lot of service (seva) to do. Our project started only a year and a half ago. We have a lot of things to do and we are also open to new possibilities.\\n\\nWe are also learning many different arts and skills such as yoga, meditation, visualization, construction, painting, building, gardening, book publication, writing, singing, artistic skills, memorizing verses, studying different scriptures, public speaking, and many other things.\\n\\nSo as a resident of the monastery I am inviting every young man who is interested to come and learn how to think like a monk, and most importantly how to live like a monk.\\n\\nIf you are interested or have any questions you can write here or contact me: brotherhoodofmonks@gmail.com\\n\\nNamaste,\\n\\nTirtha', 'Am I correct in understanding that you belong to the gauDIya vaiShNava sampradAya but not to ISKCON?', 'I wish more young people would take up monkhood in a traditional way.', 'Bhagwan Shiva and Bhagwan Ganesha in game , your thoughts , video link in comments', 'Namaste, thank you for the submission.

Good times.\", 'I will definitely play this game', 'JUST WOW !!!!', 'Gyaan Yoga - The Path of Knowledge**A Surprising Discovery**\\n\\nIt is surprising to me that there are not more posts here about Gyaan Yoga: The Path of Knowledge. The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis.

Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point.

However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels. All this everything is me etc is just a vessel to carry you to the truth and the vessel has to be abandoned one day, too. Like a boat, incredibly useful - to the other side of the river, then you abandon it and walk.\\n\\nWe use a thorn analogy, we use a thorn (advaita vedanta) to remove another thorn (human suffering) and then we discard both.\\n\\nAll this I am consciousness and everyone is me, etc etc will be refined and transformed. There is no I, consciousness is not an I. The I is the ego it\\'s ahaṃkara and consciousness is something completely different. The fact you can see the object of I-ness is proof it is not pure consciousness.\\n\\nReality is nondual, it\\'s not perceivable unless you\\'re using a mind to have transactions but the mind will limit you to a perspective of reality that is from the point of view of the mind. Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing. This disqualifies it\\'s classification of being nihilistic. Since nihilism has a \"no point\" sort of feel, and in Vedanta we believe existence is the point. Vedanta adds meaning to life, it doesn\\'t remove it.', 'What you said isn\\'t true for just Advaita Vedanta, it is true for all of Vedanta. The point that \"whatever I do is a barrier for moksha\". While it is true that the perception of \"being the only conscious being\" is not exactly the best way to word Advaita, still what you said is shared by all schools of Vedanta. \\n\\nI was going to give you a detailed answer backed up from Bhagavad Gita. But, Vashishta Muni already has answered this question when teaching Bhagavan Sri Rama. Hence it seems best that he should answer your doubt as well directly. \\n\\n[Refutation of Fatalism - Yoga Vashishta](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/yoga-vasistha-english/d/doc118039.html)\\n\\nYou can read the preceding 5 chapters to get an understanding of the basis for it if you wish. This would have the answer though. \\n\\n\\n\\nJai Sita Rama', 'Knowing that this is maya or imagined reality through anubhava is only one half of awakening. The other half is the remembrance of who you are.', 'It\\'s a beautiful question, the questioner\\'s mind has popped out of the closed box mindset, it lets me guess. Because if the question was asking for parallels between Buddhism(shoonyavad) and nihilism it would just be an ordinary philosophy class question.\\nBut the fact that the two, Advaita Vedanta and Nihilism might have some parallel, even such confusion is an insight.\\nAnd I would like to consider them one by one, so to start with Advaita Vedanta, I would like to quote a phrase from Adi Shankaracharya, \\n\"Brahman Satya Jagat Mithya, Jeevo Brahmaiv Na Parah.\"\\nThis translates to Brahman alone is real, the universe(or world) is unreal, and the individual self is no other than Brahman itself(the supreme self).\\nFor nihilism, I would like to define it as the following \"extreme scepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real existence.\"\\nSo the common thing between them is the negative value ascribed to the existence. \\nBut nihilism only ends there and has no other conclusion to draw from this fact.\\nWhile Advaita Vedanta, though says the world is unreal, but it has a conclusion, or an assertion to make regarding the reality of the individual. So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings. This is ego, made possible by mind and the senses, powered by intellect. \\n\\nThere are two ways I can describe our situation-\\n\\nA. Video game  \\nB. Dream\\n\\nIn all this \\'video game\\' we are a part of, we often forget ourselves, playing hours and hours (lives), initially remembering ourselves, but just for fun. Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives. He stabs you in the chest and you see that another person was watching impassively neither helping you nor the other guy. Now you wake up. Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan. You and the countless others before you and after you are the same, parts of dream of Vishnu. Now, you might think, why should I suffer for his Leela? He ain\\'t paying my emi nor helping me deal with office politics. But remember, in your dreams of fear and pleasure, everything was in your head, you imagined juvenile things with your latest crush or saving the world with iron man. They are not true, but your perspective in dream know it. The ego won\\'t allow that. And that leads to all the \"suffering\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>It also terrifies me to think that under all the layers of personality I think of as \"me\", there is really just a single consciousness, the same in everyone. \\n\\nWhy would \"you\" feel terrified when \"you\" in your thoughts and feelings, insecurities and securities, the physical and mental manifestation is but a dream? When \"you\" come out of the ego that there is neither \"I\" nor \"you\", there is no world but just a dream, everything in Brahman and everything from Brahman, every thought, action and feeling from him, why would \"you\" \"feel\" anything at all?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI would suggest you to read Bhagawad Gita (I read the translation by Swami Sivananda and checked any doubts in YugalSarkar website). If you could think this much, that is the will of God that your character is to come out from the game.

', 'your thoughts on the portrayal of Krishna in Shin Megami Tensei IV: ApocalypseI presume most of you aren\\'t familiar with the video game series: shin megami tensei (smt for short). To sum it up it\\'s a long-running jrpg series that is usually set in an apocalyptic setting and revolves around ideological conflict, this includes:\\n\\n1. The law side which fights for order and archives to create a socialist utopia represented by the judeo-christian angels\\n\\n2. It\\'s opposition, the Chaos faction that strives to create a dystopian anarchy so \"only the strong can survive\" and limitless freedom can be accomplished that is represented by the judeo-christian fallen angels/demons\\n\\n3. and the neutral side which denounces both so humanity can follow the best of both sides, which results in it being unstable and suseptable to more ideological wars, and is represented by humans and sometimes even random pagan gods and goddesses.\\n\\nNow, some of you may be familiar to [this little controversy](http://nichegamer.com/2016/02/03/hindus-are-pissed-that-krishna-is-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final/) that happened over a year ago (i\\'m not sure how repeatable the source is, so take it with a grain of salt), which actually inspired me to write this post so i can present what krishna is in-game to those not familiar with it. To begin, i\\'ll just say he\\'s more than just a summonable ally, he plays a major role in the story actually.\\n\\nnow that i\\'ve quickly boiled down the basics of the series, maybe you are wondering what that role in the latest game is. Well, i can\\'t really do this without spoiling the game\\'s plot, but here i go: after he is unsealed he preaches about how yahweh trapped souls into the material realm so they are forced to cling to him via the circle of law-chaos (i could go more into detail, but that\\'d make this post a lot longer than it already is). Krishna\\'s plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy. But no such luck with Krishna, he\\'s simply a forced antagonist who you can\\'t side with.\\n\\nand the last thing i will talk about, the character design: now, [his regular form](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/8/8d/SMT_IV_FINAL_Krishna.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025173647) is a pretty good design personally, and along with being very expressive it does a good job conveying his charming, calm but also snarky and sometimes sarcastic. i\\'m not sure whether i\\'d say \"that\\'s Krishna\" the first time i saw his design, but he definitely feels like krishna when i look at him (at least to me)\\n\\nBut his [vishnu](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_B_SMT4A.jpg) [designs](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_II_SMTIVA_Official_Art.jpg) seem to go more with the forced antagonist role he plays in the story; maybe the design is referencing something i don\\'t know, but with the \"nandakas\" in the second form that really look more like lightsabers, i can\\'t help but to look at vishnu and think \"what is he, a sith lord?\" Kinda discredits him as a god of preservation when his design seems to just say *evil*\\n\\nSo that about wraps it up, but as a note i should say that my goal is not to upset or get anyone offended with this post. i\\'m just curious to see what this community thinks of Krishna\\'s whole portrayal in this game. is it faithful to his origins or not? is this offensive or are these just silly video games that shouldn\\'t be taken seriously?

L. Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes.

This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe). It is more like Kashmir Shaivism and other similar traditions.\", \"Advaita Vedanta is a beautifully rich tradition, but I fear it often becomes the most popular choice for people (often westerners) who are simply shopping around for interesting philosophies. \\n\\nRemember to ground your understanding in some sort of real practice or Sadhana, otherwise it's just intellectual gymnastics. \", '[deleted]', \">you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ‘you’ stay in this material world and utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' (the impeccably designed video game).

Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality\\n\\nSo literally doing anything at all goes against non-duality? In which case, Shankara who wrote volumes of literature and spent his entire life debating people would also be pretty non-advaitic. You sound like some edgy nihilist who just discovered buddhism.\\n\\n\\nThe brahman maybe formless but it's not some dead and static inertia where literally nothing happens. In kashmiri shaivism, the idea of constant internal movement - spanda - is the defining characteristic of the highest non-dual reality, as it is of the grossest reality.\", 'Jcink Roleplay - Hinduism ElementsIf you don\\'t know - a roleplay on a message board (like Jcink or Proboards) is essentially writing parts of a story with friends online (you write part of it, then a friend will respond and write the next part, and it goes from there, piece by piece). \\n\\nPantheons (Greek/Roman, Norse, just to name a few) are a fun subject to explore with this type of collaborative writing setting.\\n\\n**I had a friend that wanted to make a roleplay but involve the Hindu pantheon in some shape or form (modern day gods on earth, children of the gods, mortals blessed with the god\\'s powers through blessed items, etc.).

I am enchanted.', '[deleted]', 'Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism# Necessity of Vedas and Guru in Hinduism\\n\\nsource: paraphrased from several talks by Swami Paramarthananda.\\n\\nThere is a lot of confusion around the necessity and role of Vedas and guru in Hinduism.  These are some common questions that people have.\\n\\n1. Why do I need to study the Vedas?\\n2. Is a guru really necessary?\\n3. Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\\n\\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\\n\\n>tadviddhi praṇipātēna paripraśnēna sēvayā |  \\n>  \\n>upadēkṣyanti tē jñānaṁ jñāninastattvadarśinaḥ || 4.34||  \\n>  \\n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus? How do know that am not a guru?', '[deleted]', 'Very great post, and finding a Guru is one of the most valuable steps a seeker can take.\\n\\nAn important point is to not to treat acceptance of a guru casually and make a quick decision(something which happens a lot these days, sometimes followed by regrets). This is much more important than even something like marriage, and it is not considered good to leave and accept another person as Guru.  The student is usually encourage to spend some time testing and only when convinced at heart,  to commit to someone as Guru and be fully dedicated to their teachings.\\n\\nAlso, we need more guidance about sadhanas that somebody who hasnt yet found their Guru can do, how to find sadhanas which get you close to the Guru principle/tattva,  like Guru Gita, stotras to Dattatreya or Dakshinamurty,', 'Thank you for writing!', 'Indeed satsang (company of learned people) is very helpful.

Those who live by these four attain happiness irrespective of what race, religion,ethnicity, region, gender you belong.  \\n', 'Hinduism isn\\'t one religion. it\\'s more of an umbrella term. you see, when the Persians first invaded India, they referred to people in the valley on the other side of the Indus River as \"Hindus\". later, when other groups came into contact with the Indian subcontinent, they referred to the religious practices of the people there as \"Hindu religion\". these people had various different beliefs, practices, gods, and so on, including the Brahman religion as well as many others. it wans\\'t until after the colonization of India by the British Empire, and the subsequent call for an Independent India (then called Hindustan), that the people there really began to form the idea of a united Hinduism. \\n\\nHinduism, as a term, is a recognized world religion, but it still encompasses many different religions and schools of philosophy. there are the Vaishnavas who believe that Vishnu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead; there are the Shaivites who believe it is Shiva who is Supreme Personality of God; there are the Shaktas who believe Shakti is the Supreme Personality, with different schools believing that it is either her form Kali or her form Devi; and there are Smartists who believe that there is no single Supreme Personality, and that each person chooses their own God to be representative personality of God to them.\\n\\nthere are Hindu schools of thought that claim God is singular and manifests in many incarnations as the other gods and demigods; there are those who believe that God is entirely impersonal and exists in all things and is synonymous with the Universe; there are those who believe that there is one Supreme God and many lesser gods beneath him.\\n\\nsome believe that your station in life (everything from your financial status, to your caste if any, to your species) depends on you karma from your previous life. if you were evil or sinful then you will be born into a lower station or even as an animal, bird or reptile, insect, plant, or even a rock. these people believe that only humans have free will and responsibility and can sense God; others believe that you can reincarnate into various species with no rhyme or reason, and that your social station is not entirely based on your karma from a previous life, but can be changed in this life through good works.\\n\\nthe common ultimate goal of all Hindus is generally to achieve Moksha and end the cycle of reincarnation. this is interpreted differently for each Hindu. some believe that you go to a sort of Paradise lke Heaven. some believe that you join with God and lose all Ego and sense of individual identity. some believe that Moksha is like Nirvana and you are simply enlightened and don\\'t have to die to enjoy the bliss that comes with it. however, there are even a few Hindus who believe that ending the cycle of Samsara is selfish, and instead seek to merely Love and give eternal devotion to God. I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house. I have come to Hinduism after a long exploration of other religions since my teens. ', \"Hinduism is difficult to understand in few short paras or even book. For example, many hindus will refute your claim about it being polytheistic, stating all those gods/demi-gods etc are just manifestation of one power which is formless and attribute-less (some hindus will claim one god but with attribute and form instead). Coming from abrahamic religions, people get confused with not-so-well-defined aspects of Hinduism, so I recommend reading some publications from Hinduism Today which clarifies Hinduism in detail. http://www.hinduismtoday.com \\n\\nAdding to /u/storytimesover response -\\nSwastika - considered auspicious among Hindus, still used a lot even though world sees it differently. This documentary might be of help - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbeYIBT9XVc\\n\\nGanesha - considered to be God of wisdom and remover of obstacles (that's why you'll ganesha idol in majority of cars owned by Hindus). May be this might help although it's a long read - http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1366. Google will show many more perspective of Ganesha. \\n\\nWeird rules - depends on perspective\\n\\nMeaning of life - that question is essence of Hinduism, not the god/deities/rituals/rules. Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred. Offer your food to the god you wish to please (offering to Krishna pleases all the gods).\\n\\nReincarnation: Your next vessel is a result of the karma (action) of this life and previous lives. You can overcome reincarnation by returning to Godhead/Krishnaloka/Vaikuntha.\\n\\nThe meaning of life, in my opinion, is to live for Krishna and create a better world for all living entities.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha. So end of Mahabharata brings about a change not just in the rulers of Hatinapur but gave a new direction to the entire the then future of India wherein not just a new power  arose to rule but also a different philosophy which was Non-Vedic in nature gained prominence.

I understand that I'm not saying its not a valid stance. However Smite is what sparked the fire with my conversion to Hinduism. Reading the spark note esk back story on the devas made we want to look up and learn more about them and what they represent. I was an athiest for several and had tried other religions and philosophies before as I've stated before , without feeling the tiniest sliver of anything. Then after reading the Mahabharata and the Ramayana I prayed for a sign that this was the proper path for me and was answered! And now I'm way happier than I ever was with anything else and I owe it all to Smite getting that going. So with both main sides being addressed(obviously its not just a two side question) what does everyone else think about it?\", 'I want Hindu Gods and Goddesses to be used in video games because it increases the exposure to a different audience.\\n\\nI do find offensive the World of Warcraft, the most popular MMORPG, depiction of Goddess Kali imagery as a demon and they even have a NPC known as [Jagganath](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=90458/jagganath#screenshots) who need to be slain for the players to progress. ', \"I understand how someone might find the video portrayal a bit offensive. It is sort of trivialising. \\n\\nTake for example Sri Rama.

One is supposed to approach him through devotion alone.\\n\\nDo you see the contrast between this and when he is a 'cool' character in a video game and does 'cool' stuff. Though Rama is the main figure in Ramayana, he is not a character from a book. He is viewed by many as God who is to be revered, to be worshipped. Hence the perceived offence.\\n\\nThat aside, Hindu gods do have a ton of qualities that make them nice video game material. And personally, I kind of agree with the  company president's statement.  And anyway it is not like offended people will blow themselves up and kill someone.

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \\n\\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \\n\\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\\n\\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\\n\\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\\n\\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \\n\\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*', '\"you are the universe experiencing itself\"', 'Namaste, thank you for the submission.

Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya. Try to go beyond Maya — break free the bondage by associating our self with body and mind.', 'I started a series on this exact topic.

Do you know the reasons for not eating meat or fasting for certain periods?\\n\\nAttending temple is certainly not mandatory **BUT**  the temple is a place to attune spiritual energies. Just as how many people choose to go to the gym instead of working out at home, attending places that serve a purpose attune your mind to a different frequency.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, you are a teenager and will be questioning everything. The answers are there.', \"It's tough being a teenager these days. Your parents are just doing what they think is right for you. I wouldn't be too hard on them. Still, you have your own life to live, and some day you'll be independent. I recommend a book for you called 'Life Skills for Hindu Teens' published by Himalayan Academy. It's free to read on-line, and you might get something out of it. One of the stories (it's written as fiction, with lessons inside each story) is almost exactly your dilemma. \\n\\nGood luck. May you find a happy compromise that suits both you and your parents.\", 'Hahaha a Hindu is someone who destroys their own ignorance. We are seekers of truth and integrity is a huge part of that. If you want someone else’s words about it, I say if you want to be more empowered then you need to get rid of the laziness keeping you from temple. Think of that. What’s keeping me from going to God? Tiredness? Is it because you’re non-veg? You need to pay attention to your thoughts and karmas because that is literally what Hinduism is about. Not just Bhakti, but also liberation from samskaras and it seems you have a kind of immature view of why Hindus do what they do so you should learn more and appreciate your beautiful and blessed culture. It will make you understand the importance of vegetarianism and why temples are so important and why we do puja and wear traditional clothing and such. It’s all to lead to enlightenment right?? So if you let your tiredness stop that, then it’s like saying you’re not seeking enlightenment, just love for god. Which isn’t inherently bad, buttttt it’s not exactly fully integrated to it. Though I understand. And if someone forces you, you want to do the opposite so they love you and care but may need you to step into your own path. They just want you to be blessed and live a good life. Even if it annoys you', 'I’m not sure what to say here. You won’t go to a temple because you’re lazy?

His book mainly deals with how one can apply the concepts of law and order in daily life, personal, social and universal levels. However, the book, as is evident from its inconsistent manuscripts all over India, is not entirely the work of a single self assumed “Manu”, but rather a collective work of creative and stubborn fascists who had but a very strong vision on rule-making and science of administration.\\n\\nBefore we spit out to the Manu and the Brahmins, we must also note that Manu could not have been a single author, and he could not have been a fully racist casteist. Though Manu does appear racist fascist in designating non Aryans outside Aryavarta as barbarians, and casteist through his statements, it is to be noted that only less than 60% of the book is really authentic. And within that, there are internally inconsistent verses. So, in whole, even to this day, one can follow the Manu smrti that suits him, from the collection of verses we have today.\\n\\nSo what does it speak about?\\n\\nContrary to the popular belief, Manu smrti is not about imposing rule in lower castes, but it is a text that really traps Brahmins (which eventually forced Brahmins to manipulate it by adding escape clauses), and makes him not more than a robot, without self opinion or thought or choice of action. Having killed his opportunities and pleasures, the Manu “genersously” gives Brahmin a position highest in the society. (And does not forget to mention that Brahmins should always follow those restrictions) But yea, our later Manus who tampered with the text created verses that finally created an arrogant Brahmin caste in top with immense positions, who could not be questioned, but could dictate anything.\\n\\nManu discusses in detail about the different “Varnashramas” of different castes. The Brahmin’s part is naturally the largest, consisting of restrictions for every breath and movement. Almost four whole chapters are dedicated to restricting, controlling and immobilizing the Brahmin. Manu makes many clauses, some of them directly contradicting, but in the core, Manu wants Brahmin to be simply spiritual, above worldly pleasures, and highly orthodox. Manu, apart from prohibiting meat for Brahmins (somewhere else he also comments that one may eat meat “incidentally” as a leftover of a legitimate animal sacrifice), also prohibits a wide range of foods right from onion, garlic, mushroom… Brahmin is also prohibited to do any jobs other than his Veda teaching, learning, gifting, receiving business. And Manu also considers the following to be highly shameful jobs to a Brahmin (apart from the other “prohibited” jobs of other castes) : astrology, music, dance, doctor… Even Brahmin’s dress code is highly limited - he cannot wear beard if without proportionate hair locks, and even in such cases, the Brahmin with hair locks is not called to many functions like death anniversary feasts. His normal clothing, normal appearance, the attitude everything is predefined. Everything right from breathing (not joking), even eating posture (again, not a joke), walking, doing jobs, when to teach, when to learn, what to not do, how to not live your life, what not to eat, what not to think, what not to wear, where not to live, who should not invited for your parties and feasts, what not to desire, whom to marry, whom not to……\\n\\nNow comes the part of Kshatriya, the king. The Manu unlike the prohibition he made for all Brahmins from worldly pleasures, allows those “pleasures” to the king, but without addiction. However, Manu does create limits to the king and asks him to stay away from certain vices. The king’s laws are there in two chapters, but detailed so as to aid his rule. Personal rules are lesser. The rules of administration are well designed, though our later Manus have had a part in interpolating some “generous” verses into them.\\n\\nThe Vaishya and Shudras have rules separate, only in a single chapter, about 8 rules for Vaishyas and 2 for Shudras. Almost no personal restrictions as a part of their code, but their status much depends on the presence of other castes, the other caste determines the status of how one caste tends to behave.\\n\\nApart from all these personal restrictions to Brahmins in four long chapters (Kshatriyas have only two chaps for them, even when talking about ruling guidelines in detail), Manu supported Brahmins and Brahmanism. Manu does hint about Shramanas, and looks down upon them. The later Manus, through addition of thoughtful verses, made a Brahmin unquestionable. And, it would be silly to blame the initial Manu for all that.\\n\\nApart from the usual laws, Manu also anticipates laws during emergency periods. Here, a convenient relaxation is given in laws.\\n\\nIt is probable that initial Manu envisioned a well divided caste society with more pressure on Brahmins, who but recieved great respect, lesser pressure on King, who deserved respect from all, and almost no pressure on Shudras or Vaishyas. Castes below that have no personal restrictions - they can live their life without “offending” the other castes.\\n\\nAltogether, the Manu Smrti is a well planned, but corrupted text, just like any text post vedic age there are power games which are noticable, we know these inconsistencies come when any \\'religion\\' in power, we know this because we can observe this with Bhuddism and jainism scriptures as well, the moment they become the dominant religion of a region/s they start downplaying the \\'ahimsa\\' principal, we know that no matter the religion the priests which were patronised indulged in religious propaganda on the king\\'s behalf when their king and his ambition in regards to war and conquest grew and then they justified their \\'dharmic\\' war and their practices some of which are abbhorent, this was a practice done by every major religion in india when they were in the dominant position, this point is expanded upon in Upinder Singh\\'s book \"political violence in ancient india\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy point through all this is that given that we know there was power politics and propaganda in these smrities/shastras etc how much weightage do you place on these scriptures, they are not shruties which are the axiomatic texts of hinduism, you don\\'t buy into vedas and hinduism falls appart, that is not the case with smrities, so how much weight do you place on dhramshastras/smriti texts?? should they be read with \\'shraddha\\' and be above criticisms like vedas like manusmrities suggests or should they be subjected to scrutiniy and not be above criticisms??', 'The smriti deals with two kinds of dharma: viśesa dharma (special duties) and sāmānya dharma (common duties). The former pertains to the responsibilities allotted to the individual in the varnāśrama framework while the latter deals with the ethical and moral values that he must adopt.\\n\\nWe learn from the Gītā that varna is determined by svabhāva (nature). In the ancient past, it was possible to distinguish individual varnas by lineage alone owing to the prohibition on varna-sankara. In the modern age, where there is ambiguity regarding lineage, śīlā or character, becomes the identifying marker for varna. For it is written:-\\n\\n>**Mahābhārata Vana Parva, section CLXXIX**\\n\\n>“Men of all the four orders are without restriction constantly begetting children on women of all the varnas. And speech, cohabitation, birth and death of men of all the orders are similar in all respects. It is, on this account, that the wise have asserted that the character (śīlā) is the chief and needful thing.”\\n\\nThe injunctions of the dharmashastras regarding jurisprudence (vyavahāra), custom (ācara) and expiation (prayāschitta) cannot be applied in all circumstances for they operated on the presumption of a janma based varna system which obviously does not exist today. Thus, while the portion of the dharmaśastras pertaining to viśesa dharma is more or less defunct in this day and age, the prescribed sāmānya dharmas (such as ahimsa, āsteya, śauca) still apply.', 'The vedas are considered divine text so they are at the highest level, the other texts like smriti are not divine or authoritative, personally I think they should be ignored', 'Books for Motivation/PassionHello Everyone,\\n\\nRight now I (20M) am in a very competitive college program here in the U.S. and have worked very hard to get here, but recently I have been having a really distracted mind and unfocused on my studies.

The worse the Villain, the better the hero. This is the approach taken by many sects, **but does it mean the sects are wrong?** **No, I am not saying the Vaishnava sect or the Shaiva sect etc... are wrong,** but it\\'s not how many are portraying it to be. See, all it takes to destroy such an approach is just to prove that hero cannot be a hero without a villain. Or a king is only a king because of the people in the kingdom. If the kingdom is empty then **he is the king of what?** Another question can be asked. If the same almighty God created these non-almighty demigods, then why is the religion not written like the western religions where there is absolutely no doubt who is who and who is not? Why Vedas? Why Darshanas? Why Tantras? Why Itihasas? Any are these non-almighty gods outside the one Almighty God? Or are they within/part of the one Almighty God? If they are part of the Almighty god then that means this almighty god has parts that are non-almighty. It\\'s like saying my body has some cells that are of lesser and insignificant quality, in scientific terms, it\\'s called Cancer. So what are these sects?\\n\\nFor example, Srimad Bhagavatam is one of the pinnacle of Bhakti Puranic literature dedicated to Sri Krishna for Vaishnava. But in that, there is a chapter dedicated to Shiva in which he is addressed as Brahman. In the same Purana, Sri Vishnu calls Trimurti are essentially the same. So there was no need for a Vaishnava literature to say that. Even Prabhupad said that \"Sri Vishnu and SadaShiva are the same\" but only in one instance, but I will not go deep into them.\\n\\nNow take Devi Bhagavatam: Though it\\'s a pinnacle for Bhuvaneshwari, the highest order of sustenance is given to Sri Maha Vishnu than Shiva. They didn\\'t have to do that.\\n\\nNow go back to Itihasas: Both Shankara and Krishna are called Rudras. And Narayana says I am in the heart of Rudra and Rudra is my heart and those who make distinctions are fools.\\n\\nNow go back to great saints: TulasiDas who is a staunch devotee of Rama wrote Rama Charitramanas first gave salutations to Vani and Ganesha and also composed Rudrastakam (inhered from Ṛṣi Lomasa), why?   \\nBhartruhari a staunch devotee of Shiva said \"I do not see any fundamental difference between Shiva the Overlord of the universe, or Vishnu the Inner Soul of the universe.

It\\'s done so for the purpose of Sādhanā (a focused approach to rising in consciousness, without distractions of other schools).

I made a post identical to this one on the r/Buddhism subreddit as well, since it is also used to support the shifting belief system.\\n\\nFor those unaware, Reality Shifting (also called Shifting, quantum jumping, moving realities, etc.) is a HUGE community built around the idea that by using certain ‘methods’ you can move your subconscious to another reality and live out a totally new life, or that you can become aware of your already existing consciousness in another reality. Stereotypically it’s used by kids and teenagers to shift to Harry Potter and date the characters (specifically Draco) but it goes deeper than that, and many people use shifting as a way to live multiple lives with all of their favorite characters in their favorite shows/movies/anime/games/etc. Shifters tend to talk about ‘the multiverse theory’ (usually broadly or using the Many Worlds Interpretation) and use that to prove that shifting and all of these fictional worlds are real and that when they use their methods, they actually go there/become aware of their subconscious there.\\n\\nShifters tend to cite Hinduism and ‘ancient Hindu practices’ (with no elaboration) as proof that shifting is real and not just something that rose to popularity during the 2020 lockdowns on tiktok.

This is a very sick approach. Why? It\\'s like a movie where a Hero can only be a Hero because of the villain. The worse the Villain the better the hero. This is the approach taken by many. All it takes to destroy such an approach is just to prove that hero cannot be a hero without a villain. Or a king is only a king because of the people in the kingdom. If the kingdom is empty then he is the king of what? Another question can be asked. If the same almighty God created these non-almighty demigods, then why is the religion not written like the western religions where there is absolutely no doubt who is who and who is not? Any are these non-almighty gods outside the one Almighty God or are they within/part of? If they are part of the Almighty got then that means this almighty god has parts that are non-almighty. It\\'s like saying my body has some cells that are of a lesser and insignificant quality than the others, in scientific terms, it\\'s called Cancer.\\n\\n**2. I heard seen their preachers insulting many gods as demigods and way below the god in which they have faith, even they insult devotees of others\\' beliefs harshly calling the term \\'Mayavadi\\':** One has to read and explore the Veda composed by over 300 Vedic Rishis. None of them played this hasty game. None of the Rishis said, my homage or Vedic Suktam is better than your Suktam. Or my Vedic Divinity is better than yours. Many CULT preachers operate on Headcount, meaning, they are good at marketing, and their headcount determines the validity of their faith and teachings. As the saying goes **\"Believers go in groups, seekers go alone\"**. The three biggest things that anyone can do to destroy the Sanatana Culture are: 1. by distorting the credibility of the Guru and the magnificent beings born in this culture. 2. alter the Sanskrit text to one’s own desire. 3. create a hierarchy of Divinity and downplay them by calling them cheap names/designations.\\n\\n**What is an Authorized Sampradaya?** The fact is there were over 1008 Vedic Śākhās whose lineage goes back to the Vedic Rishis and Brahmanas. Today only 14 Śākhās exist and only 6 of these families still continue this tradition. **They are called Authentic.** **Got it!!!** Now there is the Agamic tradition that comes from Tantra. Today both Agama and Nigama are mixed like water and concrete. Only hand full of these agamic schools exists and are very secluded and hidden from popularity. Go and sit with these 6 Śākhās, spend time with them, serve them, and learn from them. Learn grammar (Vyakaranam) and get initiated. Chant and learn for 14 years. Then tell us what abides with the Vedas and what is not. People reading printed books and translations and coming to social media and throwing up their textbook knowledge, writing articles with their 2cent analysis is not worth the paper, nor the battery power of their phones/tablets and computers.\\n\\n**Does Smartha say all divinities are the same?** No, the Vedas themselves don’t say that, if so there was no need for so many divinities. Vedas explain various concepts of Rta, one cannot create a competition between them by putting them in a ring match and seeing who has more power and who wins. That only happens in Comic books and movies. Smartha operates on giving equal importance to all when homage is given but mandates one’s own kula-divam (Divinity/Rishi lineage of the family and ancestors) to be given the final importance.

The colloquial identification of the self and body is due to coordinative predication, which is called samAnyAdhikaranam in Sanskrit Grammar.\\n\\nThis means that the body is treated as a prakara or mode of the self, and during the time when they are associated together, i.e., the individual is alive, one can speak of the individual (body + soul) as one unit. \\n\\nIf the individual is named John, this name can be associated with the body without any error as long as John is alive, but technically, John is the name of the consciousness that inhabits John\\'s body.\\n\\nOnce John is dead, it would be incongrous (though still accepted in common parlance) to associate any name or label to the mortal remains.\\n\\nThus, as long as body and soul are associated, any property, name or label possessed by the soul is transferred without any error onto the associated body. This is the principle of SharirAtmabhava that was the bedrock of scriptural interpretation used by Swami Ramanuja and his followers. \\n\\nUsing this principle, they were able to provide a consistent framework for interpreting the entire body shruti vAkyAs, those that taught bhEda, those that taught abhEda, and those that taught a reconciliation or ghataka between the two. In contrast, Dvaita ( viz. Advaita) has to provide a justification at the outset why Bheda ( viz. Abheda) shrutis must necessarily be the correct ones to interpret.\\n\\nNow coming to your question, Ishwara is \"in\" the bad people in the sense that Ishwara pervades their soul the same way their soul pervades the body. The karma of the bad people affects their realisation of this fact, and in their ignorance, they literally identify themselves with their gross body. The karma only affects their body and soul, but not Ishwara. The soul is affected by experiencing the fruits of its actions in this birth and next. The body is affected by actual suffering it undergoes when associated with the soul.\\n\\nIshwara is unaffected. This is the statement of the parable of two birds in the Chandogya.\\n\\nAn important corollary of Ishwara being unaffected is that he bestows free will on the Jivatmas while being the absolute master of all. He expects Jivas to seek Him of their own free will. This also means Jivas have the potential to do evil. And this is reflective of their karma rather than His will. That this free will exists is stated clearly in the Brahma Sutras, and this disposes of the problem of Evil for the Vedantin.\\n\\nAnother important corollary is that any glory of the Jivatma is a vibhuti of Ishwara, the same way that the name John that is incorrectly assigned to the body us actually the name of the soul. Similarly, any imperfections pf the conduct of the Jivatma is a product of its karma and not Ishwara\\'s will, similar to how any physical imperfections of John do not affect his soul.', 'Although demons were created by God, their purpose is to represent the adversity to overcome on the path to Enlightenment.

The reality or truth is not held by the helms of time, space and causation, so from the perspective of reality, the transactional plane is mithya. But mithya does not mean false in the sense that it does not exist, it just means that it is an appearance, a limited manifestation in the helms of time, space and causation and is hence not the essential reality of things.

People come from all walks of life and from all kinds of circumstances, and approaching Hinduism purely from a spiritual standpoint is perfectly okay as a starting point. \\n\\nHowever, this stage gradually matures into the realisation that spirituality and religion are not enemies, and in fact, go hand in hand. \\n\\nImagine a building. The interiors of the building, all its various floors, right from the ground apartments to the terrace, correspond to sprituality. However, the interiors are supported by the external framework of the building, the most important part being the underground pillars and networks supporting the entire outer structure.\\n\\nThe underground pillars are the Vedas. The outer structure is itihasa and puranas. And the internal apartments in the building is sprituality, the essential teachings of religion. \\n\\nIt is impossible to ultimately be spiritual without being religious. You can have a building without apartments inside, but you can't have apartments inside without a building outside. Similarly, you can be religious without understanding its deeper teachings of spirituality, but you cannot be spiritual without being religious.\\n\\nMy basic point is this, spirituality is the epitome of religion, is the ultimate truth that religion is designed to impart to you. You cannot jump ahead directly to the truths of life without undergoing the necessary stages of development. The stages being the understanding of the scriptures, devotion for all forms of God, service to others. I've seen many people, especially in the philosophy I myself follow, that of advaita vedanta, claiming that they don't believe in God and that they are not religious. Hinduism doesn't need atheists in disguise.\\n\\nJust yesterday I saw a post on some spiritual subreddit which said 'I have opened my third eye, ask me anything.' I mean, are you serious? Have we reduced the chakras and other divine and extremely deep aspects of spirituality into some sort of game and a way of seeking validation and moral superiority and promoting pseudoscience?\\n\\nI have got into altercations with the orthodox religious people here too in the past who consider the words of the scriptures as words of God because of philosophical differences, but at least they were genuine to their philosophy and practice and were not hypocrites unlike the 'Spiritual but not religious people'. They simply see religion in a bad light and are too afraid to admit it.\\n\\nAgain, if you find yourself falling into this category, don't take this as an attack on you, but rather as an invitation to study religion deeply and with an open mind. If spirituality was simple and could be accessed directly, there would've been no need for religion in the first place.\\n\\n Orthodox religious systems are important and necessary, and while remaining stuck there and being attached to it due to identity politics is harmful, it is a necessary starting point. You need to walk into the building through the entrance, and can only then take the elevator to the topmost floor. You can't directly land on the terrace, it's called wishful thinking and lying to yourself. I'm talking to you, Advaita Vedanta. And yeah, I'm saying this as an Advaitin myself.

It's sensitivity.\\n\\nI was desensitized as a child, I think. Probably for good reason, this world is a harsh environment energetically speaking. Yoga and meditation initiated the process, but the deities, understanding them, interacting with their intelligence, opens channels within me that I have no idea how to do without those connections to the specific deity that provides, say, pain relief, as one deity does for me. When I chant to Her, it feels like cheating. Years of 🧘\\u200d♀️ yoga can't compete.

They might not pray to Brahman. They might not ask for favours, or tell their stories, or seek grace or forgiveness, or practice rituals to propitiate Brahman. For them, realising that they and Brahman are one and the same is the only goal of their seeking. \\n\\nPeople who match the above description might not identify as religious, because their relationship with the divine is so different from the prevalent Bhakti-inspired orthodox religious practices around them.\\n\\nThat said, those who believe in Brahman, an Absolute consciousness, are not atheists. Atheists believe that consciousness is born from matter and dies with matter - if their brain loses its physical form, they will cease to exist.

My name is Tirtha. I joined the temple a year ago and my life has completely transformed. Before coming here I was a confused young boy, who had just finished school. I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.). But by the mercy of my teachers, I was able to transform my life and become a better person. Although I have just started my path. I can confidently say that my life is meaningful and it has a deep purpose. I am happy, therefore I want to share this opportunity with others.\\n\\nBrahmacharya is a life of a monk, it\\'s a commitment to restrict oneself from sense gratification, and focus on your spiritual growth. Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek. There is a beautiful lake right next to us and breathtaking waterfalls just a few minutes away. It is a peaceful, quiet, and relaxing environment that is perfect for our spiritual practice.\\n\\nThis is exactly what we are doing in our ashram (temple). We are training young men (from 18 years old) to become strong, responsible individuals in our society. We are studying Vedic scriptures, under the guidance of our teacher Rasik Mohan Prabhu who is a lifelong monk, and who lived in a monastery in India for 16 years of his life. Every day we are practicing yoga and meditation. We also have a lot of service (seva) to do. Our project started only a year and a half ago. We have a lot of things to do and we are also open to new possibilities.\\n\\nWe are also learning many different arts and skills such as yoga, meditation, visualization, construction, painting, building, gardening, book publication, writing, singing, artistic skills, memorizing verses, studying different scriptures, public speaking, and many other things.\\n\\nSo as a resident of the monastery I am inviting every young man who is interested to come and learn how to think like a monk, and most importantly how to live like a monk.\\n\\nIf you are interested or have any questions you can write here or contact me: brotherhoodofmonks@gmail.com\\n\\nNamaste,\\n\\nTirtha', 'Am I correct in understanding that you belong to the gauDIya vaiShNava sampradAya but not to ISKCON?', 'I wish more young people would take up monkhood in a traditional way.', 'Shiva enters the world', 'Namaste, thank you for the submission.

The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis. Many of them go this way because, they cannot just simply accept what someone tells them, they need to see it, feel it, make it, experience it and realise and understand it themselves. A fervent need for intellectual stimulation. \\n\\nFor someone like this, is Bhakti yoga really viable ? are Bhakti and jnana from a broad perspective just diametrically opposite to one another?  On a simplistic level, the Bhakti yogi is less likely to question things as the jnana yogi is to accept things as is. \\n\\nAre these two things opposed to the other? What does reconciliation of these two really mean, does it mean you give up on one of the paths ? What prevents the jnana yogi from being able to surrender, is it the ego ? the notion of  \"I have to know, I have to find out\" ?

[Atharva Veda 20:129]\\xa0', 'These are claims found on Zakir Naik’s website and they have been debunked extensively in forums like Hindustackexchange.\\n\\nNow I would give Zakir Naik a thousand dollars if he can name the difference between a Samhita, a Brahmana, an Aranyaka and an Upanishad, as well the structure of each school of Vedic recension.', 'No. He is not mentioned in the Vedas whatsoever.\\n\\nI mean they’re not even prophetic texts so why would he even by mentioned', 'Lose that \"friend\".', 'First things first, this seems to be based on claims made by Dr. Zakir Naik, who no one can reasonably claim to be an expert on Hindu shastras. Second, the references mentioned in the way they are are nonsensical. It would be very difficult to find the verses he is alluding to using those references. So first it is imperative to provide the original verse in sanskrit to make any reasonable debate regarding this matter.\\n\\nNow let\\'s dive into the points laid out here. For the first two points, the same reference is given, which is not traceable using the structure of the reference given. The point asserts that the verses were mistranslated/misunderstood. With the scripture being so old, and so many commentaries having been written on it, and many debates having happened, and many interpretations having been extracted, not once have any of the great thinkers and philosophers of Hinduism made this claim of an Ahmed in that verse, or else it would be something that we would be hearing about much more.\\n\\nNow let\\'s address the third point. The reference given does not say that. The english translation by Ralph T. H. Griffith says this: \"These our libations, strength inspiring Soma draughts, gladdened thee in the fight with Vritra, Hero-Lord, What time thou slewest for the singer with trimmed grass ten thousand Vritras, thou resistless in thy might.\" And if you read the rest of that hymn, then you will realize that his understanding of the verse is a faulty abstraction due to baseless knowledge of sanskrit.\\n\\nNow let\\'s address the fourth point. The Rigveda reference given does not prophesize Muhammad. The word is Sushravas, not sushrama. Sushravas was a king, and he is the subject matter of the verse. The english translation of this reference by Ralph T. H. Griffith is as follows: \"With all-outstripping chariot-wheel, O Indra, thou far-famed, hast overthrown the twice ten Kings of men, With sixty thousand nine-and-ninety followers, who came in arms to fight with friendless Susravas.\" Here he is again putting his own definition into the word and drawing a conclusion that is way off-course.\\n\\nNow the final point. Once again we have a faulty reference in which he does not even mention the name of the purana he is referencing. Nonetheless, he is referencing the Bhavishya Puran. It\\'s important to know the structure of the Bhavishya Puran and the problems it has. Being thought of as a prophetic shastra, many people have added to it over the years to make it seem that certain things were foretold a long time ago. Wikipedia explicitly says, \"The \"prophecy\"-related third part Pratisargaparvan includes sections on Christianity, Islam, Bhakti movement, Sikhism, Sultanate history, Mughal history, British rule, and others. This part is considered by scholars as a 18th– to 19th-century creation.\" giving reference to scholarly articles. So to say that the verses mentioned are canon is nonsense.\\n\\nOne more point to make is that articles similar to this also mention that there is an Allopanishad (Allah-Upanishad). But the list of the 108 official Upanishads does not mention this and is considered to be a creation of the Mughal Era. Dayanand Saraswati does not consider it an Upanishad as it does not exist in the Atharvaveda (from which it is claimed to be, or any of the other Vedas). So that argument is baseless as well.\\n\\nSo, please fact check before believing nonsense like this. Even fact checking it a little, following the references to make sure they hold up, goes a long way, and would be helpful.

Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\\n\\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\\n\\n>tadviddhi praṇipātēna paripraśnēna sēvayā |  \\n>  \\n>upadēkṣyanti tē jñānaṁ jñāninastattvadarśinaḥ || 4.34||  \\n>  \\n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus? How do know that am not a guru?', '[deleted]', 'Very great post, and finding a Guru is one of the most valuable steps a seeker can take.\\n\\nAn important point is to not to treat acceptance of a guru casually and make a quick decision(something which happens a lot these days, sometimes followed by regrets). This is much more important than even something like marriage, and it is not considered good to leave and accept another person as Guru.  The student is usually encourage to spend some time testing and only when convinced at heart,  to commit to someone as Guru and be fully dedicated to their teachings.\\n\\nAlso, we need more guidance about sadhanas that somebody who hasnt yet found their Guru can do, how to find sadhanas which get you close to the Guru principle/tattva,  like Guru Gita, stotras to Dattatreya or Dakshinamurty,', 'Thank you for writing!', 'Indeed satsang (company of learned people) is very helpful.

Everything we do is counted in this world and karma is maintained for everyone (similar to reddit). Finally, as one's time is up we get old and dying.

And there Karna put up with Drona, for the purpose of learning arms.And that powerful youth contracted a friendship with Duryodhana. And having acquired all the four kinds of weapons from Drona, Kripa, and Rama, he became famous in the world as a mighty bowman. And after having contracted a friendship with Dhritarashtra\\'s son, he became intent on injuring the sons of Pritha\" - Mahabharata Adi Parva CCCVII. \\n\\nTruth - Then when was he rejected by Drona? \\n\\n\"Karna. one day approached Drona in private and said these words unto him, \\'I desire to be acquainted with the\\xa0Brahma\\xa0weapon, with all its\\xa0mantras\\xa0and the power of withdrawing it, for I desire to fight Arjuna......Thus addressed by him, Drona, from partiality for Phalguna, as also from his knowledge of the wickedness of Karna, said, \\'None but a Brahmana, who has duly observed all vows, should be acquainted with the\\xa0Brahma\\xa0weapon, or a Kshatriya that has practised austere penances, and no other.\\'\" - Mahabharata Santi Parva Section II\\n\\nSo he was rejected when he asked for Brahmastra. And the reason is clear - he asked it in order to fight Arjuna. He is jealous and also Drona was partial to Arjuna (and his son) so he rejects. It is then that he goes to Parasurama and lies that he is Brahmin, possibly also because Drona said only Brahmin and Kshatriya that have observed all vows can learn. We must remember that it is only Arjuna that reached the highest extent, hence proving that austerity, humbleness, service to preceptor are most important qualities to obtain higher knowledge. \\n\\n(2) Karna met Duryodhana for the first time in Rangbhoomi - The above passage answers this. He knew Duryodhana from Gurukul days itself. Moreover he was involved in the poisoning of Bhima. His enmity with Pandavas started from Gurukul days not from Rangbhoomi. \\n\\n(3) Karna tried to prevent Cheerharan - No, he was the one who started it. \\n\\n\"And at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by anger, waving his well-shaped arms, said these words,--\\'O Vikarna, many opposite and inconsistent conditions are noticeable in this assembly... Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the attire of Draupadi.\" - Mahabharata Adi Parva Section LXVII\\n\\n(4) Karna was rejected by Draupadi in Swayamvar - Actually only few editions, like 4 out of 1000, mention this. It\\'s an interpolation. Even the editions that mention that he was rejected, later when Dhrishtadyumna is wondering who can win the contest now that powerful kings have failed thinks \"Shalya and Karna both failed how can anyone else win?\", Clearly showing inconsistency. \\n\\nThe BORI critical edition , made after researching different versions, omits the part where she rejects him. Even Sri Madhvacharya boldly declared in 13th century itself that Mahabharata is interpolated heavily and then wrote Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya. Here he too writes that Karna missed the target and later Arjuna wins it - no mention of rejection of Karna by anyone. So on strength of Acharya\\'s words and also research we know it\\'s a later insertion. \\n\\n(5) Draupadi insulted Duryodhana as blind son of blind man - this is not in any edition. This is just from BR Chopra serial. \\n\\nThe Sanskrit version doesn\\'t really mention her specifically. Neither does Bhagavatam, it just says the ladies laughed. Andhra Mahabharatam and some other versions says the Pandavas laughed and then Draupadi and other ladies also laughed. But it\\'s just laughing which was quite natural, seeing everyone was doing that and it was indeed funny. It wasn\\'t mean-spirited, Duryodhana was too proud and hence he took it in wrong light. \\n\\nSerial wanted to spice up matters by adding a dialogue like that, but it maligned her character as a haughty woman. \\n\\n(6) Draupadi was a haughty woman - She is the one who forgives the killer of her sons Aswatthama and asks Pandavas to spare him, so no way. There is no instance where she is proud at all. \\n\\n(7) Ghatotkacha was a noble and virtuous person - This is because of folk tales. Indeed he did help out the Pandavas and Draupadi during their exile, and he served his father and stepmother well. \\n\\nYes Bhagavan Krishna was the only one cheerful when he died and also one reason was so that Arjuna is saved from Karna\\'s Vasava Shakti. But the other reason He mentions,\\n\\n\"If Karna had not slain him with his dart in great battle, I myself would have had to slay Bhima\\'s son Ghatotkacha. From desire of benefiting you, I did not slay him before. That Rakshasa was inimical to Brahmanas and sacrifices. Because he was a destroyer of sacrifices and of a sinful soul, therefore hath he been thus slain. O sinless one, by that act as a means, the dart given by Sakra, hath also been rendered futile. O son of Pandu, they that are destroyers of righteousness are all slayable by me. Even that is the vow made by me, for establishing righteousness. Whither the\\xa0Vedas\\xa0and truth and self-restraint and purity and righteousness and modesty and prosperity and wisdom and forgiveness are always to be met with, thither I myself always remain.\" - Mahabharata Drona Parva Section CLXXXI\\n\\n(8) Krishna is just a man in Mahabharata except for Gita, Bhagavatam made Him a God. \\n\\nThis is the most laughable myth. Because every stanza of Mahabharata describes Him as God! I\\'ll just give one but literally there are innumerous references. In Ramayana itself there are so many references to Sri Rama\\'s divinity but in Mahabharata there are many many more. \\n\\nTwo main ones. Bhishma declares this in entire Sabha of all the kings of India and front of Devas also during Rajasuya Yajna. And Markandeya Rishi who personally met Bhagavan Narayana tells Yuddhishtira about Narayana and at the end says \"The Krishna you have with you now is that same Narayana \" and instructs him to worship Him. \\n\\nEven Duryodhana knew. Dhritarashtra is told this and that no one can win over Krishna. So he gets fearful and tells Duryodhana to stop fighting but Duryodhana says that he knows all this and that he can\\'t win but that still he needs to, he can\\'t stop himself, the anger against Pandavas is too great. Then Dhritarashtra curses his fate. \\n\\nThese are it for now! Doubts about any other incidents? Let me know! \\n\\nAdditional -\\n\\n(1)  Pandavas went to hell and Duryodhana went to heaven - that is just a vision. Why would Pandavas, the close friends of Krishna, go to hell? Krishna, who is declared as \"krishnam dharmam sanatanam\"? \\n\\nThe various abodes they reached are described in Mahabharata. Arjuna reaches Vaikuntha and is shown to be sporting with Krishna there. So no Pandavas did not go to hell. The Swarga Duryodhana went to is temporary as the Gita declares, it\\'s not a permanent abode of bliss like Vaikuntha. \\n\\n(2) Shakuni was motivated by revenge - Interesting tale but no factual basis. It is not mentioned in Mahabharata, \\n\\n\"the chaste Gandhari hearing that Dhritarashtra was blind and that her parents had consented to marry her to him, from love and respect for her future husband, blindfolded her own eyes.\\n\\nSakuni, the son of Suvala, bringing unto the Kurus his sister endued with youth and beauty, formally gave her away unto Dhritarashtra. And Gandhari was received with great respect and the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp under Bhishma\\'s directions. And the heroic Sakuni, after having bestowed his sister along with many valuable robes, and having received Bhishma\\'s adorations, returned to his own city.\"\\n\\n- Mahabharata Adi Parva Section CX. \\n\\nShakuni\\'s brothers are killed in Kurukshetra by the Pandavas, so no way they all died in a dungeon. He just loved his nephew and hence supported him. \\n\\n(3) Shakuni was a master strategist and rivalled only by Krishna, he planned everything - I don\\'t recall any instance where he really did that much. I can only remember him driving the game of dice forward but otherwise it was mostly Karna and Duryodhana taking decisions. Shakuni seems to be the most moral out of the \"evil 4\" in fact. \\n\\nNeither does he seem like a master genius anywhere, he was definitely a master dice player and was smart . But  his intelligence is overblown. I don\\'t recall any super genius plan of his, and definitely Mahabharata is not just a chess game between Krishna and Shakuni like people think. He was nowhere near Krishna. \\n\\nAdmittedly I can\\'t recall other genius plans, I\\'d like to know if there is any story that shows Shakuni plotting. \\n\\n(4) Arjuna hated Karna - The rivalry was more one-sided. Karna wanted to prove himself as the best warrior and better than Arjuna. Narada Muni says that there aren\\'t warriors that can beat Arjuna and Karna implying that they are the best, hence Karna wanted to prove himself better than Arjuna and built up hatred and jealousy for that reason from schooldays itself. \\n\\nBut Arjuna did not really hate Karna. He was indifferent. He only focused on bettering his skills. When Bhima takes the vow that Arjuna shall kill Karna in Kurukshetra after Vastraharana is probably when his anger starts. Even then it\\'s not such an intense feeling from his side - he definitely is angry at Karna but the intense rivalry is more from Karna\\'s side.\\n \\n(5) Krishna is a morally gray character - No, in fact He and Vyasa Mahamuni (I would add Vidura too) are the whitest characters morally. It is known to everyone that where there is Dharma, there is Krishna and that where there is Krishna there is Dharma. Hence even the Kauravas showed respect before the war. Krishna was immensely respected and it was known that He is always, always on the side of Dharma. \\n\\nNot once did He transgress morality or the words of the scriptures, in fact when He is reviving Parikshith one of the statements He says is \"If I have never told a lie, let this child be revived\" . So definitely He never lied. \\n\\n(6) Krishna is bound by Karma, that is why He could not escape Gandhari\\'s curse - Krishna is free to do whatever He wants. Not just Him, no jnani is bound by Karma, He declares this emphatically in the Bhagavad Gita which is found in Mahabharata. Second, it is not that He can\\'t escape Gandhari\\'s curse - \"Krishna suffered it to take place although he was fully competent to baffle it. Govinda was able to alter the very course of the universe with all its mobile and immobile creatures. What need then be said of the curse of even high-souled Brahmanas? \" - Veda Vyasa Mahamuni says this in Mausala Parva Section VIII. \\n\\n\\n\\nJai Sita Rama', 'This needs to be pinned.\\n\\n\\nPlease add your insights on Duryodhan and Shakuni that you previously shared in my question a few months ago.\\n\\n\\nI recently discovered that Shakuni asks Duryodhan to stop obsessing, to which Duryodhan threatens to commit suicide (emotional blackmail) to enlist Shakuni.\\n\\nJai Shri Ram!', 'very informative. thanks.', 'Mahabharat is history of India.

I would like to add.\\n\\nWhen the laughing at duryodhana episode happens, acharya madhva writes that Krishna started laughing first, then bhima, then draupadi and everyone else. The reason was that duryodhana decided to stay back after the rajasuya yajna and then there was set up a royal council to discuss the future of the kingdom of yudhisthira. How to administer a kingdom that large and how to spread dharma. In this council all the kings, Krishna, narada and other great people were attending. *Duryodhana, who got a formal royal invitation, staggered in drunk out of his mind and late.* He also slipped and fell because he couldn't even walk properly because of the intoxication. The reason krishna laughed was to bring an end to him.\\n\\narjuna never talked about killing karna till he took part in the disrobing of draupadi. Arjuna got the various astras from Drona because he had won over the negative faculties and had conquered himself. krishna loved him because of that. Karna wanted the astras to be in the good graces of duryodhana and to be the one to kill arjuna. In fact, the sadhana of arjuna for the role had started before his being born as arjuna. The gandiva bow wielding boon, he had done tapas before and gotten it. Arjuna is indra himself with avesha of nara form of krishna.

That is 'worry' samadhi. There is no cognition of surroundings, just a blank stare. Or we might be engrossed in a book, caught up in a game, or intently watch a movie.

This isn't possible with normal objects of the world, it requires some divine support such as the ishta devata. The point is not to concentrate the mind in selfish pursuits, but rather concentrate the mind on a universal truth or symbol of the truth like Om or the ishta devata. This concentration is not like the narrow minded and focused concentration of playing a game or reading a book, but is a very broad and encompassing concentration where you are concentrating on everything at once, per se, because you're concentrating on the symbolism of consciousness itself.

Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point. Till we attain moksha which is the same as realizing that we are eternally Brahman, the normal rules of morality, human ends, meaning etc all apply. \\n\\nTo give an example, we all know that the world is made of fundamental particles of various kinds. However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels. All this everything is me etc is just a vessel to carry you to the truth and the vessel has to be abandoned one day, too. Like a boat, incredibly useful - to the other side of the river, then you abandon it and walk.\\n\\nWe use a thorn analogy, we use a thorn (advaita vedanta) to remove another thorn (human suffering) and then we discard both.\\n\\nAll this I am consciousness and everyone is me, etc etc will be refined and transformed. There is no I, consciousness is not an I. The I is the ego it\\'s ahaṃkara and consciousness is something completely different. The fact you can see the object of I-ness is proof it is not pure consciousness.\\n\\nReality is nondual, it\\'s not perceivable unless you\\'re using a mind to have transactions but the mind will limit you to a perspective of reality that is from the point of view of the mind. Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing. This disqualifies it\\'s classification of being nihilistic. Since nihilism has a \"no point\" sort of feel, and in Vedanta we believe existence is the point. Vedanta adds meaning to life, it doesn\\'t remove it.', 'What you said isn\\'t true for just Advaita Vedanta, it is true for all of Vedanta. The point that \"whatever I do is a barrier for moksha\". While it is true that the perception of \"being the only conscious being\" is not exactly the best way to word Advaita, still what you said is shared by all schools of Vedanta. \\n\\nI was going to give you a detailed answer backed up from Bhagavad Gita. But, Vashishta Muni already has answered this question when teaching Bhagavan Sri Rama. Hence it seems best that he should answer your doubt as well directly. \\n\\n[Refutation of Fatalism - Yoga Vashishta](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/yoga-vasistha-english/d/doc118039.html)\\n\\nYou can read the preceding 5 chapters to get an understanding of the basis for it if you wish. This would have the answer though. \\n\\n\\n\\nJai Sita Rama', 'Knowing that this is maya or imagined reality through anubhava is only one half of awakening. The other half is the remembrance of who you are.', 'It\\'s a beautiful question, the questioner\\'s mind has popped out of the closed box mindset, it lets me guess. Because if the question was asking for parallels between Buddhism(shoonyavad) and nihilism it would just be an ordinary philosophy class question.\\nBut the fact that the two, Advaita Vedanta and Nihilism might have some parallel, even such confusion is an insight.\\nAnd I would like to consider them one by one, so to start with Advaita Vedanta, I would like to quote a phrase from Adi Shankaracharya, \\n\"Brahman Satya Jagat Mithya, Jeevo Brahmaiv Na Parah.\"\\nThis translates to Brahman alone is real, the universe(or world) is unreal, and the individual self is no other than Brahman itself(the supreme self).\\nFor nihilism, I would like to define it as the following \"extreme scepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real existence.\"\\nSo the common thing between them is the negative value ascribed to the existence. \\nBut nihilism only ends there and has no other conclusion to draw from this fact.\\nWhile Advaita Vedanta, though says the world is unreal, but it has a conclusion, or an assertion to make regarding the reality of the individual. So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings. This is ego, made possible by mind and the senses, powered by intellect. \\n\\nThere are two ways I can describe our situation-\\n\\nA. Video game  \\nB. Dream\\n\\nIn all this \\'video game\\' we are a part of, we often forget ourselves, playing hours and hours (lives), initially remembering ourselves, but just for fun. Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives. He stabs you in the chest and you see that another person was watching impassively neither helping you nor the other guy. Now you wake up. Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan. You and the countless others before you and after you are the same, parts of dream of Vishnu. Now, you might think, why should I suffer for his Leela? He ain\\'t paying my emi nor helping me deal with office politics. But remember, in your dreams of fear and pleasure, everything was in your head, you imagined juvenile things with your latest crush or saving the world with iron man. They are not true, but your perspective in dream know it. The ego won\\'t allow that. And that leads to all the \"suffering\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>It also terrifies me to think that under all the layers of personality I think of as \"me\", there is really just a single consciousness, the same in everyone. \\n\\nWhy would \"you\" feel terrified when \"you\" in your thoughts and feelings, insecurities and securities, the physical and mental manifestation is but a dream? When \"you\" come out of the ego that there is neither \"I\" nor \"you\", there is no world but just a dream, everything in Brahman and everything from Brahman, every thought, action and feeling from him, why would \"you\" \"feel\" anything at all?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI would suggest you to read Bhagawad Gita (I read the translation by Swami Sivananda and checked any doubts in YugalSarkar website).

Bhishma, the grandfather of the Kurus, having heard this, sent messengers unto the king of Gandhara. King Suvala at first hesitated on account of the blindness of the bridegroom, but taking into consideration the blood of the Kurus, their fame and behaviour, he gave his virtuous daughter unto Dhritarashtra and the chaste Gandhari hearing that Dhritarashtra was blind and that her parents had consented to marry her to him, from love and respect for her future husband, blindfolded her own eyes.\\n\\nSakuni, the son of Suvala, bringing unto the Kurus his sister endued with youth and beauty, formally gave her away unto Dhritarashtra. And Gandhari was received with great respect and the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp under Bhishma\\'s directions. And the heroic Sakuni, after having bestowed his sister along with many valuable robes, and having received Bhishma\\'s adorations, returned to his own city. And, O thou of Bharata\\'s race, the beautiful Gandhari gratified all the Kurus by her behaviour and respectful attentions.

', \"This is a very low-level reply (mine is), and is not at all meant to be even remotely complete.  But off the top of my head, based on what you've said, the idea of Trimurti https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimurti is possibly worth looking into.  Specifically what made me think of it is that the ideas of creation/maintenance/destruction or transformation are basically considered, by many, to be essentially universal processes or principles.  Given that you're talking about mass destruction and what-not, that could potentially be understood in that light - destruction is not necessarily a bad thing, not at all, but rather a catalyst for transformation and new growth.  This is sometimes personified by Shiva and/or his consort in different forms.\\n\\nThis would likely be quite accessible to a wide audience, and would not be overly technical - see the discussion by /u/metaltemujin on what your target audience is supposed to be.\\n\\nFeel free to listen to anyone more knowledgeable than me, that just came to mind.\", \"Maybe couple of points. My perspective of Hinduism (You're allowed to have it). The whole universe is divine incl. us and all the intergalactic dust. Every atom recycles itself into something all the time in this universe. So it applies to one's soul(if you believe in soul anyway), it recycles once the carrying body is dead. So rebirth. The divine Brahman's body is all the matter in the universe and it's soul is God(conscience). Just like our body is a part of our universe, our soul is part of the collective conscience. Each soul has individuality and in order to reach God, it should have 0 net karma. These are all my own understanding and may not agree with popular theories. Also since you are talking about space, you can use the above theory that every soul reincarnate to fulfil their Dharma(which is acheive 0 karma). But if the carrier planet(Earth) is destroyed, the souls which has to be reincarnated will reincarnate in other planets with life. Intergalactic Hinduism.

He never asked for any wish or boon from Sri Krishna. When Krishna was at the verge of completing His Avatar, he called Uddhava and said,‘ Dear Uddhava, in this avatar of mine, many people have asked and received boons from me; but you never asked me anything. Why don’t you ask something now? I will give you. Let me complete this avatar with the satisfaction of doing something good for you also.’  \\n>  \\n>Even though Uddhava did not ask anything for himself, he had been observing Krishna from his childhood. He had always wondered about the apparent disconnect between Krishna’s teachings and actions, and wanted to understand the reasons for the same. He asked Krishna, ‘Lord, you taught us to live in one way, but you lived in a different way. In the drama of Mahabharat, in the role you played, in your actions, I did not understand many things. I am curious to understand the reasons for your actions. Would you fulfil my desire to know?’  \\n>  \\n>Krishna said, ‘Uddhava, what I told Arjuna during the war of Kurukshetra was Bhagavad Gita. Today, my responses to you would be known as ‘Uddhava Gita’. That is why I gave this opportunity to you. Please ask without hesitation.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava starts asking – ‘Krishna, first tell me who is a real friend?’  \\n>  \\n>Krishna says, ‘The real friend is one who comes to the help of his friend in need even without being called.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava: ‘Krishna, you were a dear friend of the Pandavas. They trusted you fully as Apadhbhandava (protector from all difficulties). Krishna, you not only know what is happening, but you know what is going to happen. You are a great gyani. Just now you gave the definition of a true, close friend. Then why did you not act as per that definition. Why did you not stop Dharmaraj (Yudhishtra) from playing the gambling game? Ok, you did not do it; why did you not turn the luck in favour of Dharmaraj, by which you would have ensured that dharma wins. You did not do that also. You could have at least saved Dharmaraj by stopping the game after he lost his wealth, country and himself. You could have released him from the punishment for gambling. Or, you could have entered the hall when he started betting his brothers. You did not do that either. At least when Duryodhana tempted Dharmaraj by offering to return everything lost if he betted Draupadi (who always brought good fortune to Pandavas), you could have intervened and with your divine power you could have made the dices roll in a way that is favorable to Dharmaraj. Instead, you intervened only when Draupadi almost lost her modesty and now you claim that you gave clothes and saved Draupadi’s modesty; how can you even claim this – after her being dragged into the hall by a man and disrobed in front of so many people, what modesty is left for a woman? What have you saved? Only when you help a person at the time of crisis, can you be called ‘Apadhbandhava’. If you did not help in the time of crisis, what is the use? Is it Dharma?’  \\n>  \\n>As Uddhava posed these questions, tears started rolling from his eyes.  \\n>  \\n>These are not the questions of Uddhava alone. All of us who have read Mahabharata have these questions. On behalf of us, Uddhava had already asked Krishna.  \\n>  \\n>Bhagavan Krishna laughed. ‘Dear Uddhava, the law of this world is: ‘only the one who has Viveka (intelligence through discrimination), wins’. While Duryodhana had Viveka, Dharmaraj lacked it. That is why Dharmaraj lost.’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava was lost and confused. Krishna continues ‘While Duryodhana had lots of money and wealth to gamble, he did not know how to play the game of dice. That is why he used his Uncle Shakuni to play the game while he betted. That is Viveka. Dharmaraj also could have thought similarly and offered that I, his cousin, would play on his behalf. If Shakuni and I had played the game of dice, who do you think would have won? Can he roll the numbers I am calling or would I roll the numbers he is asking. Forget this. I can forgive the fact that he forgot to include me in the game. But, without viveka, he did another blunder. He prayed that I should not come to the hall as he did not want me to know that through ill-fate he was compelled to play this game. He tied me with his prayers and did not allow me to get into the hall; I was just outside the hall waiting for someone to call me through their prayers. Even when Bheema, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva were lost, they were only cursing Duryodhana and brooding over their fate; they forgot to call me. Even Draupadi did not call me when Dusshasan held her hair and dragged her to fulfil his brother’s order. She was also arguing in the hall, based on her own abilities. She never called me. Finally good sense prevailed; when Dusshasan started disrobing her, she gave up depending on her own strength, and started shouting ‘Hari, Hari, Abhayam Krishna, Abhayam’ and shouted for me. Only then I got an opportunity to save her modesty. I reached as soon as I was called. I saved her modesty. What is my mistake in this situation?’  \\n>  \\n>‘Wonderful explanation, Kanha, I am impressed. However, I am not deceived. Can I ask you another question’, says Uddhava. Krishna gives him the permission to proceed.  \\n>  \\n>‘Does it mean that you will come only when you are called! Will you not come on your own to help people in crisis, to establish justice?’, asks Uddhava.  \\n>  \\n>Krishna smiles, ‘Uddhava, in this life everyone’s life proceeds based on their own Karma. I don’t run it; I don’t interfere in it. I am only a ‘witness’. I stand close to you and keep observing whatever is happening. This is God’s Dharma.’  \\n>  \\n>‘Wow, very good Krishna. In that case, you will stand close to us, observe all our evil acts; as we keep committing more and more sins, you will keep watching us. You want us to commit more blunders, accumulate sins and suffer’, says Uddhava.  \\n>  \\n>Krishna says, ’Uddhava, please realise the deeper meaning of your statements. When you understand & realise that I am standing as witness next to you, how could you do anything wrong or bad. You definitely cannot do anything bad. You forget this and think that you can do things without my knowledge. That is when you get into trouble. Dharmaraj’s ignorance was that he thought he can play the game of gambling without my knowledge. If Dharmaraj had realized that I am always present with everyone in the form of ‘Sakshi’ (witness), then wouldn’t the game have finished differently?’  \\n>  \\n>Uddhava was spellbound and got overwhelmed by Bhakti. He said, ‘What a deep philosophy. What a great truth! Even praying and doing pooja to God and calling Him for help are nothing but our feeling / belief. When we start believing that nothing moves without Him, how can we not feel his presence as Witness? How can we forget this and act? Throughout Bhagavad Gita, this is the philosophy Krishna imparted to Arjuna. He was the charioteer as well as guide for Arjuna, but he did not fight on his own.’ – Realize that Ultimate Sakshi/ Witnesser within & without you! And Merge in that God-Consciousness! Discover Thy Higher Self – The Pure Loveful & Blissful Supreme Consciousness! – Tat Tvam Asi!\\n\\nTL;DR; Krishna smiles, ‘Uddhava, in this life everyone’s life proceeds based on their own Karma.

In puranas we see Shiva as someone who swallows halahal poison to save the world.

I would go further on this, but not publicly. In any case, I wouldn\\'t worry. Love God, however you conceive of Her; the rest will take care of itself. :)\\n\\nEDIT: I forgot to mention something. Pope John Paul II -- an amazing guy, IMHO -- said (regarding Christians, of course) that it was possible to participate in Jesus\\' substitutionary atonement, i.e. for a Christian to suffer for another\\'s sins. Don\\'t you think that\\'s amazing? To have the opportunity to participate in the redemption of the world?\\n\\nI have read, in Hindu literature, that it is not possible to take on the karma of another person; but I think that\\'s wrong. I feel sure of it. Love breaks all the rules, and what is love but the total gift of self to another. I think that, if anything, is the defining characteristic of God: that She gives of Herself, constantly and completely. I think we were created in order for Her to have others to give Herself to. How can we not give our whole selves to others? We are all One, ultimately. Can we not suffer for others? The answer seems clear, at least to me.', 'My view is that in order for Hinduism to light you up in the skull, you have to practice it.

Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes. This then to us regular ppl appears as someone having a really really sh\\\\*tty life full of misery, suffering, etc. SO Karma indeed is the answer but there are nuances within that as well.', \"4. The creature experiencing the evil is an incarnation of God, taking on the pain for some reason that will be known later.\\n\\nExample: the Ramayana\\n\\nAlso, I don't really consider 2 or 3 to be reasons for evil to exist. They are just incidental side effects of 1: Karma.\", \"I would argue that a omnibenevelant God would do bad in the interest of good by helping us grow through suffering. As demonstrated by yin and yan, there is good in bad and bad in good. So I would extend your reincarnation point to growth within a single life, as well as over multiple life times.\\n\\nThe point of good and evil being illusionary is interesting. I understand its called illusionary as we as humans conceptualise everything and as we do our definitions are out of touch with the way things are, it's not actually saying that these things don't exist. This teaching is only calling for a deeper understanding into reality, such as, can evil be classed as inheriently bad if its nessesary for good to exist?\", \"I've never heard of this 'well known' argument. Shucks darn. Mystics don't argue.\", ',hank you for posting.', 'A DETAILED ARTICLE BY MAANOJ RAKHIT ON HINDU CASTE SYSTEM&#x200B;\\n\\n**The basics before you proceed**\\n\\nThere is something you may want to understand well before you proceed any further. If your slate/page is full you won\\'t have any place to write on it until you clean it up well. Similarly, your mind, your thoughts, your emotions —almost your whole being—is covered with a blanket. This blanket is made of primarily three components - your religion, your education system and media around you. Using (or abusing) the Media (the immensely powerful tool that it is) you are constantly being bombarded with what you *should know*. These *invisible shackles* are too demanding to let you lose. \\n\\nYou may think that you are free to form your independent opinion—almost about anything—but the truth happens to be otherwise. You are also constantly reminded that you are making an informed choice but the reality is opposite. You never realize that you are always being fed with selective information. Your religious guides tell you what they want you to know. Much the same is the case with your educators and your media. Your psyche formation —right from your childhood through adolescence to the adulthood—takes place under their guidance. And, my objective is to break that cordon of cultivated misinformation, and the resultant ignorance.\\n\\nWhen an Untruth is repeated thousand times it begins to sound like truth. When it is repeated hundreds of thousands of time it becomes The Truth, and the real truth becomes the Untruth. Your school textbooks are the best tool to achieve this fate. From the very childhood your brains are washed thoroughly leading you to a make believe world of which you have no direct experience because it relates to that Past where \"you\" were not Present!\\n\\nYour direct experiences of today (if any) are projected as the direct outcome of that remote past of which you have no true experience, except whatever you may have been told via your textbooks, your religious guides, and media stories. Guides of organized religions have their own agenda that itself guides their thought and action, and based on that they guide the thoughts and actions of their followers. Contents of educational textbooks and media coverage get widely influenced by the images that their religious guides have helped them form over generations. If there remains any question of doubt it is duly taken care of by those who control things from behind the scene, the very support system which regulates breathing of educational institutions and media outlets (that is the inflow of finances and the power centers). \\n\\nThe repetition which has carefully shaped the untruth as truth can only be neutralized by equal amount of repetition. And therefore, you must not frown upon any repetition in my works, though they are often not verbatim repetitions. You may as well enjoy reading them. 25-10-2007\\n\\n**On gross social injustice in form of caste system**\\n\\nSome of you may have read *Seed-2* and some of you may not have. I receive plenty of feedback from my readers and I know that most often people do not get on hand the first book first. They get at random one of the books from someone and start reading it. It simply does not happen that they have access to all my works so that they can read them sequentially. Hence, those who have not read *Seed-2*, for them, the following section will be helpful. And for those who may have read *Seed-2*, for them, it may serve as recapitulation. Some arguments may be common with *Seed-2* and some not—to support the same case a different logic may have been used.\\n\\n*When you think of Caste system you think of gross social injustice towards a very large section of Hindu society. And Hindu Braahman is said to be the main culprit behind this injustice. This theory has been so well propagated that people today simply find no need to apply their mind. Just like any other superstition or blind faith they believe in this theory. Whenever any such propaganda driven theory is popularized with purpose, there is always some hidden beneficiary. Who all were those—that I have discussed elsewhere—I wouldn’t want to get sidetracked here—so let us stick to the point.* \\n\\nHindu society’s foundation was based on 4-Varn System: Braahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shoodr Varn. 16th century Christian missionaries coined a new term for this: Caste system. 19th century fiercely-Christian T B Macaulay introduced Christian Missionary driven English Education System by systematically eliminating Ancient Hindu Education System in BhaaratVarsh. Christian educators slowly poisoned the minds of unsuspecting Hindu children against Braahmans. 20th century Nehru dynasty pampered Marxist-fake-Secularist educators who continued the process with greater enthusiasm. Education system, newspapers, magazines, cinema, every possible media was used. With continued repetition every one came to believe that Hindu society practiced gross social injustice in the name of Caste system. Now look at these documented testimonies that give you a totally opposite picture. These testimonies were carefully kept out of your view for long, though they existed all along! You must read them and ask yourself a question— \\n\\n*Can the foundation of Hindu society be based on gross social injustice when ‘justice and truthfulness’ has been the lifeblood of the Hindu Society through the ages?*\\n\\nMax Muller filled 37 pages with examples of Hindu Justice and Hindu love for Truth and he said that he could go on quoting many-many more. To top it he titled the chapter as *Truthful Character of the Hindus* in his book *INDIA what can it teach us?* He categorically stated (p.50): \"Now, it is quite true that during the two thousand years which precede the time of Mahmud of Gazni, BhaaratVarsh has had but (\\\\*not) few foreign visitors, and few foreign critics; *still it is extremely strange that whenever,* either in Greek, or in Chinese, or in Persian, or in Arab writings, *we meet any attempts at* describing the distinguishing features in the national character of the Indians (\\\\*Hindus), regard for truth and justice *should always be mentioned first*.\"\\n\\nHe goes on to state (p.59): \"I have left to the last of the witness who might otherwise have been suspected—I mean the Hindus themselves. The whole of their literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth.\" \\n\\n*Now tell me—do you think a society could have all along practiced gross social injustice towards its own people, a society whose whole literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth?*\\n\\nAnd why does he say \"I have left to the last of the witness who might otherwise have been suspected\"? He knew that his audience (ICS aspirants at Cambridge University in England 1882) would think these were for talk not for practice. *Therefore, he cited numerous facts based on Hindu life style and conducts before he moved to Hindu literature so that his audience realizes that the teachings of Hinduism were truly reflected in the conduct of the Hindus—and that is the real test—the speech and action must corroborate, or else, it’s fake.*\\n\\nBefore Christ was born, 5th Century, Greek physician Ktesias dedicated in his works a special chapter on Justice of the Hindus. *Hindu Justice could not have been exemplary to Greeks if Hindu social structure was truly based on a system of gross social injustice towards the vast majority of its own people.* *This is nothing but plain logic and you do not need vast degree of intelligence to understand it.* Nevertheless, let us proceed with (a) what other observers documented about the Hindu society over a period as large as two thousand and four hundred years and (b) *witness the kind of consistency those documentations reflect at.* \\n\\nBefore Christ was born, 4th Century, Greek Ambassador Megasthenes spoke of Hindu love for Truth and that no Hindu was a slave. *Now tell me, how is it that Megasthenes documented in 4th century BC that \"no Hindu was a slave\" in a society that is supposed to have practiced gross social injustice in form of infamous Caste system?* \\n\\nAfter Christ was born, 2nd Century, Greek Arrian the pupil of Epictetus said Hindus were never accused of lying. 7th Century Chinese Hiouen-thsang spoke of Hindu Straightforward Honesty and Never Unjust nature. *How is it that a society, accused of practicing gross social injustice towards its own people, has been praised by Hiouen-thsang putting it on record ‘with regard to justice, Hindus make even excessive concessions’?* \\n\\n11th Century Muslim Conqueror spoke of Hindu Justice, Good Faith, Honesty and Fidelity. *Once again, it has been said that ‘Hindus were naturally inclined to justice and never depart from it in their actions’. How could they have allowed social injustice of the kind they were accused of by Christian educators and Communist educators?* Ever wonder if they were educators by profession or professional liars? *What was their objective? Did they want Hindu children to get cut off from their mainstream religious and cultural base and begin to look for alternative with (a) Christianity in ChristianBritish days (b) with Communism/Marxism in so-called post-independence days?*\\n\\n13th Century Italian Marco Polo spoke of **Hindu Braahmans** as the most Truthful, for they would not tell a lie for anything on earth! *Now ask yourself, who have been lying all along? These people from different origins, from different centuries, who came and visited Hindus and came to invariably the same conclusion? Or, Christian missionaries who had the hidden agenda to convert Hindus into Christianity by hook or crook? Or, Communist-Marxist historians of AMU and JNU who had a hidden agenda to spread their wings so they could keep their illegitimately acquired hold over Hindu society?* All fraudsters have a brotherhood kind of feeling and they support each other. This is what these Christians and Communists had been doing but simpleton Hindus did not see through their foul play. Wake up my Hindu nation and try to understand their game plan. \\n\\nOn the other hand, only three centuries later, the Saint of Christianity named Francis Xavier of 16th century (we will soon see what other people of 16th century have to say) calls Hindu Braahmans as perverse, wicked and crafty men and terms all Hindus as unholy race (Seed-5). Such happens to be the character of a Saint of Christianity. So, you can well imagine what would be the character of the lesser ones than a Saint. *When their ulterior motives are not otherwise fulfilled, they resort to tarnishing the image of others, and in doing so they reveal their own ‘wicked and crafty nature’.* The same applies to the ChristianEnglish educated ChristianizedHindus, and CommunistMarxist thinkers who adopted such questionable methods to raise their own social status by fraudulently reducing others. And, on that premise they built their imaginary theory of so-called **Oppressive Braahmanism** so that they could discredit the Braahmans, and occupy their coveted position in the Hindu society which these characters were not worthy of. Using (rather abusing) their hold over administrative machinery and educational system, they filled Hindu children’s minds with the filth that the Braahmans practiced much despised caste system and untouchability to retain their own superiority and their hold over Hindu society. *In the process, they not only* *tarnished the image of Braahmans in Hindu society, but effectively persecuted Hinduism itself on a much wider scale.* Their motive was simple: convert the Hindus into Christians. Communists followed the lead and used the same technique. Their motive was equally simple: convert the Hindus into Communists/Marxists. \\n\\n13th Century Muslims spoke of Hindus Free of all deceit, violence and fear of death. *And, Hindu Braahmans have been accused by Christians and Communists for deceit and violence in form of gross social injustice!* The foundation on which the Christians and the Communists built their propaganda was the **imaginary** theory of Aryan Invasion (Seed-2) and establishment of so-called (imaginary) oppressive Braahmanism. *This in itself was a fraud against humanity, and deceit of high order. This crooked theory has caused immense harm to the humanity.* \\n\\n14th Century Friar Jordanus speaks of Hindus True in Speech and Eminent in Justice. *But same Hindus are accused of gross social injustice by our Christian educators and Marxist intellectuals.* Must you continue to respect these liars who committed social fraud on you? *Ask Hindus, ask yourself. Don’t you owe at least, that much to yourself?* How long do you wish to live under the spell of these crooks that taught you nothing but lie?\\n\\n15th Century Persian Ambassador spoke of Perfect Security that Merchants enjoyed in our country. *Hindu Kshatriyas fulfilled their duty not only towards their own people but also towards foreign traders and an average Hindu fulfilled his duty towards the society at large.* And, what have these crooks given you now after destroying the social fabric of Hindu society? \\n\\n16th Century Muslim Minister Abul Fazl spoke of Hindu Truthfulness, gratefulness, and unbounded Fidelity and Never flies from Battlefield type character. *This was true of every Hindu Kshatriya—when he left for the battle field his mother would tell him that \"the day has arrived for which Kshatraanis (Kshatriya women) breast fed their milk to their children and the time has come to repay that debt!\"* And, what these Christian educators have taught you all along, that, Hindus were so much divided all the time that they could not face the Muslims. Besides, lowering your self-esteem what else have they given you? Have they given you the knowledge that has benefited you, or have they cheated on you while maintaining a poker face all the while? 19th Century common Muslims spoke of Hindu Straightforwardness. Do you find any trace of straightforwardness in these Christian and Marxist educators? Why do you still continue to let them remain your educators? \\n\\nMax Muller compares legendary Hindu honesty with English and French, and finds it superior to the Europeans. He also mentioned that he can go on quoting book after book and you will find that no one ever accused Hindus of falsehood. *Think, my dear fellows, think, can the Truthfulness of this magnitude survive in a society allegedly ridden with social injustice? Or, the allegation itself has been fraudulent, and a fabrication with ulterior motive?* We will deal with those motives, in detail, in our other books. You will see from historical evidence that historical frauds have been so common with Christianity from its very inception that it has become the second nature of Christianity. 18th century Warren Hastings \\\\[India’s First Governor General 1774-1784\\\\] spoke of Hindus as Less prompted to Vengeance for Wrong Inflicted than any people on the face of the earth. This is probably the reason that Hindus continue to tolerate these fraudsters, who have perpetrated social fraud of such magnitude that they have destroyed a great civilization that lasted thousands of years until these crooks arrived on the scene. Expect me not to use better adjectives for them—they should be identified as they have been and as they are. Bishop Heber spoke of Hindus as more easily affected by kindness and attention to their wants and feelings than any people he ever met with. *This is probably the reason that Hindus respected Christianity looking at handful of honest Christians like these counted few.* \\n\\nElphinstone spoke of Hindus about their freedom from gross debauchery. *People who live a life of purity, they do not indulge into the kind of gross social injustice they have been accused of,* by Christian educators and communist educators. \\n\\nSir Thomas Munro, the eminent Governor of Madras, spoke that Hindus were not inferior to the nations of Europe and he was convinced that England had more to gain if Civilization became an article for trade between BhaaratVarsh and England. *Do you think Sir Thomas Munro would have said something like this if our Hindu society were ridden with social injustice of the kind these Christian and Marxist educators have told us, and told the world?* \\n\\nProf. Wilson spoke of better quality of Hindu Honesty at Calcutta Mint than other mints elsewhere in the world. *Do you think that the people who cannot have any social justice within their social framework can have people commonly as honest as indicated here?* \\n\\nProf. Wilson spoke of **Braahman Simplicity truly Childish**. *Do you think that these Braahmans could have been credited with such childish simplicity if they happened to be such dirty people, who were alleged to have created this treacherous caste system for their own benefit?* Look at the statement (see *Seed-5 Christianity in a different Light—Face behind the Mask*) of St. Xavier, which painted Braahmans as perverse and wicked. Look at his reason, which he himself described to the Society of Jesus. *Xavier could not convert many Hindus into Christianity. His ulterior motive was hurt. So, he painted Braahmans in such bad light. His successors did the same thing. Later day missionary educated Hindus parroted what their teachers had taught them. Realize that you have learned the falsehood from your Christian educators and you have spread that falsehood further through television serials, movies, newspapers, etc. Now you must stop and reverse that process, which you too are responsible to some extent but only as the pawns in the hands of those master conspirators, who fooled you and cheated you all along.* If anyone is to be despised, it is not **Braahmans** but these cheats called Christian educators and Communist-Marxist educators.\\n\\nColonel Sleeman has put on record that he had before him hundreds of cases, in which a man’s property, liberty, and life depended upon his telling a lie, and he refused to tell it. Max Muller then asks: Can many an English judge say the same? *Could our so-called wretched caste system and a socially unjust society have produced such truthful Hindus incomparable elsewhere?* Do you realize the significance of this sentence: Can many an English judge say the same? *By deductive logic, if the outcome was so great, then the foundation also had to be equally great. And, that foundation was the 4-Varn System.* People with vested interest speak against it. People of ignorance keep parroting the same. Today, if we do not see any trace of such legendary truthfulness amongst Hindus, it is because these Hindus have become Christianized-Hindus, under the very bad influence of six generation of English-Christian Education System, which Macaulay instituted as he wanted to Christianize the Hindus. \\n\\nMax Muller says that for past two thousand years Greeks, Chinese, Persian, Arabs, all described the most distinguishing feature of Hindu society as its regard for truth and justice, *but for two hundred years English-Christian education system taught Hindus that the most distinguishing feature of Hindu society was its social injustice in form of 4-Varn System, which they renamed as caste system.* Were these Christian educationists lying all along? *Was their lie part of a much bigger conspiracy against Hindu society? Was it to bleed Hindu society to death?* \\n\\nEnglish Merchants spoke that commercial Honor stood higher in India (BhaaratVarsh) than in any other country. Why we do not see any evidence of it today? *Is it because Christian educators have completely ruined the sense of ethics amongst Hindus? Educators, who themselves posses no ethics, what else can they pass on to their pupil?* *If they themselves were not truthful, then how could you expect to learn anything about justice from them?* \\n\\nYou must understand this basic fact: *if the foundation is* *based on fraud, its outcome will also be fraud. In this context, English-Christian education system’s foundation was based on fraud against Hindu society. Their purpose was ignoble. Their intentions were conspiratorial. There was simply no regard for truth and justice in their belief system. Therefore, they produced crops like themselves. Students of their education system, through next six generations, gradually continued to become fraudulent like their teachers. They lost regard for truth and justice that happened to be cherished Ethos of Hindu society until two centuries ago!* \\n\\nMax Muller wrote the whole of Hindu literature from one end to the other is pervaded by expressions of love and reverence for truth. He expressed doubt whether in any other of the ancient literatures of the world you will find traces of that extreme sensitiveness of conscience which despairs of our ever speaking the truth. *Now, ask yourself a question. Here stood Hindu society which practiced truth and justice by thought, speech and action for thousands of years, and with consistency. Could there have existed, unnoticed by all concerned, the gross social injustice of such magnitude in form of the infamous caste system? Was it the brainchild of those conspirators, who converted into reality of today, something that was nonexistent in the days of which they spoke of?* \\n\\nMax Muller writes, Hindus may teach us at least one lesson of truthfulness, that is, truthfulness to ourselves. *What did Christian educators do? Instead of learning that truthfulness from Hindus, they destroyed the truthfulness of Hindus.* This is what you acquire from an Aasuric religion like Christianity. They have destroyed your sense of ethics, justice, truthfulness all that you ever valued. \\n\\n*If it was all so good for 24 centuries continuously, as documented in the testimonies of non-Hindu visitors to this Hindu land, then what went wrong in less than two centuries? The answer is simple. Keeping all factors constant, the only variable on the scene is the presence of Aasuric influence of Christianity, which has eclipsed the Hindu society.* \\n\\n**Braahmans were the poorest of all**\\n\\n*It generally takes longer to build than to dismantle! Not for centuries, but for millenniums,* ***Braahmans*** *played the exemplary role. They themselves lived as the poorest of the lot but raised rich morals among the rest in the society. And, ample evidence of such rich morals, as documented by many-many foreign visitors to this Hindu land over more than two millenniums, you have already seen.* Do you remember the legendry poor *Dronaachaarya* who could not buy milk for his only child *Ashwatthaama*? Do you remember poor *Sudaama* who could only carry few grams when he went to meet his childhood friend Shri Krishn? Do you remember the stories that you read during your childhood? Whenever the central figure of the story happened to be a Braahman, did those stories not begin as \"Once upon a time there was a poor Braahman\"? Can you remember any story \"Once upon a time there was a rich Braahman\"? Well, I would not be surprised if you manage to find me one of them created during past fifty odd years by one of those MarxistCommunist intellectual professors of JNU who have mastered the technique of fabricating history in connivance with their bedfellow AMU professors. You will find enough evidence of such historical fabrications in *Seed-1.*\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nNow I invite you to take a special note of the fact that all the testimonies that I have presented before, are \\n\\n• Not by people who had a specific mission \\n\\n• Not by people who subscribed to a single ideology \\n\\n• Not by people who were part of a single theology \\n\\n• Not by people who were in any way connected with each other by an invisible thread \\n\\n• Not by people who had any reason to carry any special leaning in favor of the Hindus \\n\\n• Not by people who could be accused by any stretch of imagination that they were working together towards building a specific image for the Hindus. What does this all convey to you?\\n\\nThe extraordinary character and integrity of Hindu society was incomparable in the recorded history of mankind, and therefore, I see no reason whatsoever to be defensive about our ancient 4-Varn System and try to explain it away apologetically in the manner many modern interpreters tend to do. *It is their own low self-esteem that makes them do so. Their knowledge is of no use if they cannot see through the game plan of those conspirators who have brought their self-esteem to this low level.* \\n\\n*It is our 4-Varn System that prevented extinction of Hindu society under thousand years of barbaric Islam invasion, whereas* financially supported (by Hindus) one-class (monk based) Buddhist society was totally wiped out from BhaaratVarsh on account of the same Islamic invasion. \\n\\nHindu Society that was known for its regard for Justice over two thousand years \\\\[5th Century BC-AD 19th Century\\\\]. *Such society could not have been practicing gross social injustice within its own framework. This is nothing but plain and simple logic!* \\n\\n**A message to the Braahmans** \\n\\nI am not a Braahman by birth. I have no personal interest in defending you. I am on the side of Dharm. And Dharm is always on the side of Truth.\\n\\nI won\\'t fight your battle today. You have to do that. I will only hand you the ammunition needed for you to fight that battle of Truth. Let knowledge be your \"Bow\" and arguments be your \"Arrows\". This is what I offer you!\\n\\nBraahmans! Realize your strengths. You have given birth to Dronaachaarya, and he had raised an Arjun.

I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house. I have come to Hinduism after a long exploration of other religions since my teens. ', \"Hinduism is difficult to understand in few short paras or even book. For example, many hindus will refute your claim about it being polytheistic, stating all those gods/demi-gods etc are just manifestation of one power which is formless and attribute-less (some hindus will claim one god but with attribute and form instead).

Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred.

Or also in my case as a way to think about how fast exponential growth is (I am a math teacher)\\n\\nIt goes something like this:\\n\\nWhen the game of chess was invented in ancient India it became extremely popular through out the country.  In particular there was a king that was especially fond of the game and quite good at it.  He was so confident in his abilities he made a challenge to his subjects that if someone could beat him at the game he would grant them any prize that was in his power to give.\\n\\nMany people attempted to beat the king but all failed, until eventually a timid man came forward to take the challenge and actually ended up winning the game.\\n\\nThe king being very impressed with the man\\'s skill asked what the man would like for his prize and the man responded:\\n\\nWhat I want is this: on the first square of the chess board place one grain of rice, on the second square of the chess board place two grains of rice, on the third square of the chessboard place four grains of rice and so on doubling the amount of rice on each square until you get to the end.\\n\\nThe king laughed at the seemingly humble request and called to his assistant to fetch a bag of rice from the store room.\\n\\nHowever the Kings accountants quickly realized that the mans request was far from humble, because if we went on continuing to double the number of rice on each square by the time we got to the 64th square there would be 2^63 grains of rice, or 9,220,000,000,000,000,000  or 9.2 Quintilian grains.  Which is more rice then the entire planet could produce in a thousand years.\\n\\nWhen the king realized the blunder he made by accepting to give this to the man, the man revealed himself to be the Hindu god Krishna (If I remember correctly, I could be wrong about their name)  and Krishna told the king that he did not expect payment right away and could be paid over time.  And so to this day people still offer rice to the god as penance for the arrogance that he displayed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain I just like this story because it illustrates exponential growth and the idea of \"look before you leap\"  But I wanted to know if this story was actually part of Hindu tradition, if it was actually Krishna or a different god,  and if it is not a part of Hindu cannon is it offensive to tell the story this way?  Because I think it is kind of like poetic justice to have it end that way.\\n\\n\\nAny thoughts or comments are welcome, thanks!', 'Yes it is a part of Hinduism. The temple \"Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple\" was built based on this action of Sri Krishna.

Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\n--------\\n\\nThis is a tough question to answer.  The only way I can explain it requires a bit of a philosophical paradigm shift, which is to say I embrace a somewhat Yoga-esque, \"endeavor to enjoy experience without the desire for result\" standpoint.  But that\\'s not an easy answer to accept.\\n\\nI\\'m still researching Dzogchen Buddhism, which seems to closely align with this idea of a dream-like \"un-reality,\" but I\\'m not having much luck so far.\\n\\n---------\\n\\nSo my question (at long last) is this: how can I best explain to someone that an illusory reality, a \"lie,\" is worth taking seriously?  What is the \"point\" of doing anything if reality is really just a dream?', '> \"What is the point,\" they ask, \"if everything is just a dream? Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\nIt makes me wonder:\\n\\nWhat does one gain if it is not a dream, if it is not an illusion? If something is \"just\" a dream, this implies that there is some sort of reality to which \"just\" cannot be applied. What is that? When you scrape this real world, what comes off in your hand? It\\'s more than experiences, so what is it? What is left over that makes this real world more real than the illusory world?\\n\\nIf the problem with the illusory world is that it doesn\\'t have a point, the real one must. What is that, and how does it differ from a set of experiences?', \"One answer is that it will still feel real to you. If a Godhead is dreaming it or not doesn't really change the reality of pain/sorrow/enjoyment. You cannot get out of our reality by thinking yourself out of it, there are specific processes to get out of it, that would be the spiritual processes of yoga.\", 'This is why one does not learn philosophy from video games. Can you explain in any clear terms what the statement \"A dream in the mind of the Godhead\" even means and why we should think that this is what is the case?\\n\\nI am not aware of a single Hindu school that says we are a dream in the mind of a Godhead. And this is why you\\'re not having any luck, it\\'s a nonexistent position only found in new age books and video games. ', \"Krishna Consciousness What is Paradise? Would it be some kind of situation in which every desire is satisfied? That would be a hollow kind of joy, and anyway, there would always be some unavoidable conflict with others wanting different things. Actually to want some kind of immortality as an individual ego is something very shallow, true joy begins where false ego ends.\\n\\nSo a more sophisticated explanation is something like “Nirvana” as it is described by certain Buddhist schools, the complete destruction and dissolution of all ego. It is clear that false ego is the primary cause of suffering, with all of the subconscious games it plays keeping us caught up in empty fascination. Hence the contemplative techniques, meditative techniques, found in all serious forms of religion, which are designed to help us see through our own selves, to look within and see the face beyond the masks. *“Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes”*, said Carl Jung.\\n\\nYet there is something unsatisfying about this. Ego-Death is a kind of death after all. There is something fundamental to humanity, the desire to live, something about the experience of being human which makes us wary of annihilation, even if it be a form of peace beyond that of individual existence. There is a natural desire to live, to be a human being, even if *“life is suffering”* as Buddha taught. This instinct often leads us away from religion, into the life of the senses and worldly pursuits for gain, but it can also lead us to a more holistic, more total, conception of a Paradise.\\n\\nKrishna Consciousness begins with the notion that we are all originally servants of God, whose qualities are encapsulated and present in the name KRISHNA. To be liberated from suffering is to return to our original position as servants of God, rather than as servants of the senses and of our desires. As God is in every way perfect, serving God is therefore the highest form of bliss any soul can attain.  \\n\\nUntil we turn away from the material life and engage in the Devotional Service of Krishna, again and again we are cast into physical bodies in order to satisfy particular desires and in accordance with the results of our previous actions. Just as the body changes from youth to old age but the soul remains the same, so do we change bodies but remain the same spiritual spark of consciousness. Returning to our original position, seeking to again become servants of Krishna, is the way to freedom from this cycle of Death and Rebirth known as Samsara. Thus it is taught that through Devotional Service we will attain rebirth on one of the spiritual planets collectively known as Vaikuntha and continue forever serving Krishna in His presence.\\n\\nThis whole conception quite nicely synthesises the other two conceptions of Paradise as Eternal Bliss or Ego Annihilation. What’s more, Krishna Conscious philosophy also includes in itself these other forms of Liberation or Paradise, which it considers to be partial and temporary. The worshippers of Demigods after the death of this body go to different planets where fulfilling the desires of the senses is very easy, before eventually returning to earthly realms. The “Mayavadis” and Buddhists who seek Ego-Annihilation are dissolved in the light emanating from Krishna, also eventually redescending into material creation.\\n\\nWhat we must understand is that Krishna is not an abstract concept or some incomprehensible effulgence. He is a personality (Vigraha) possessing all opulences. Sat-Chit-Ananda; Eternity, Bliss, and Knowledge. He is the Supreme Personality, qualitatively the same as us but quantitatively superior.  We must understand that Eternal Joy is found in no longer serving the Ego but serving Krishna instead. Everyone must serve something, be it some sectarian religion, their country, their family etc., but the intelligent person takes to serving Godhead. After all, God is the source of all things, the source of all happiness. We simply must accept that we are not and shall never be God, nor shall we find any permanent joy outside of serving Him.  \\n\\nThis Yoga of Devotional Service, is known by the Sanskrit name of BHAKTI YOGA.\\n\\nVarious simple rules were put into place by Prabhupada, the founder of the Krishna Consciousness movement in the West, for those wishing to practise Bhakti Yoga. There are four Regulative Principles: 1) No Meat Eating 2) No Gambling 3) No Intoxicants 4) No Illicit Sex, which devotees of Krishna should strive to conform to. In general we must avoid those things which keep us bound up with material nature, identified with the material body rather than the spiritual soul.  \\n\\nFood should be offered to Krishna before being consumed in order to free us from the Karmic effects of it’s production. We should not eat meat, fish and eggs along with onions and garlic are also prohibited. To kill, even an animal, is against the laws of nature, and cow protection is a central pillar of Krishna Consciousness – after all, the cow is like our mother, giving us milk. In general asceticism proves useful in returning back to the spiritual planets, back to Godhead, but we should not be extreme:\\n\\n“*There is no possibility of one's becoming a yogi, O Arjuna, if one eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.” (Bhagavad Gita As It Is 6:16).*\\n\\nNonetheless it is quite possible to seek to serve Krishna even if we haven’t mastered the Regulative Principles, any efforts will bear fruit. Most importantly, and before everything else, it is necessary to chant the MAHA MANTRA:\\n\\nHARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE  \\n HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE\\n\\nThis Mantra, the Holy Name, is not quite like many forms of prayer. We are not asking for anything except to be the servant of Krishna always, there is no question of wanting money or material exaltation. The chanting of the Mantra is compared to a child crying for its mother. It contains all the potencies of Godhead in its transcendental sound vibration. People remark that it is not tiring to chant this mantra as some other mantras can become. Devotees in these times try to chant a minimum of sixteen japa (16 x 108) of this mantra each day, though in the past saints have chanted many more and a few still do today.\\n\\nThe chanting of Holy Name was widely popularized by the last Avatar of Krishna, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, in the 15th and 16th century. He was the “Yuga Avatar” of Krishna, giving the appropriate teaching for the present age. We are currently in what is known as Kali Yuga, the dark age of the cycle of four ages. In this age human life is shorter, there is more suffering, little spirituality or charity and many other negative symptoms. However on the positive side it gives us the opportunity to return to Godhead through the simple process of chanting Hare Krishna. Furthermore it is predicted that humanity will experience a ten-thousand year golden age within Kali Yuga, a time when the chanting of Maha Mantra will be widespread.\\n\\nWe can abandon all other processes and simply surrender to Krishna. There is no need for any extraneous and sectarian practises beyond this: *“If you pour water on the root of the tree, the water reaches to the branches, to the twigs, to the leaves, to the flowers, to the fruits automatically”*. God has many names, there are many ways of approaching Him, but the chanting of HARE KRISHNA is the most suitable process for these times. The motto of Krishna Consciousness is:\\n\\n“SIMPLE LIVING, HIGH THINKING”\", 'There are 2 paths...one of moksha which is ultimate death and then there is of bhakti- to be near your prabhu and enjoy only the good parts of existence( encapsulated by Narad Bhakti Sutra).

Like a drop of water on lotus leaf, the drop is attached to the leaf yet is detached.   \\n\\n\\nIt is said that there are different levels of permanence of pleasure & pain that comes from any attachment. Some pleasures & pains pass quickly, some linger longer. But, none of them are really permanent. If the pleasure & pain is not really permanent, if it waxes & wanes depending on age, circumstance, availability of other pleasures, then the object of these emotions is not an ideal permanent attachment to the soul either.   \\n\\n\\nI think it is inevitable to get attached, but we need to realize it will all pass & is not really a permanent attachment to your soul.   \\n\\n\\nIt is like playing a game of chess.

The usual objection to this is social or an attitude one internalizes from education - society praises selfless actions and looks down upon selfish actions. Now, this can be a good thing in many situations(helping people become more happy, avoid conflicts) or maybe not in a few situations. But the important point is that this surface criticism is not the main thing.\\n\\nIn contrast, consider this change - someone likes eating a lot, but runs into health problems, then does some kind of fast say one day a week, actually feels better than even when he was eating a lot, both for health reasons and also due to a development of a certain vairagya(non attachment) which is experienced as a kind of a freedom.\\n\\nDharma teachings say that the root of this process depends on one's understanding of self - for instance, in the giving up of a book, or a more intense example leaving a house after staying for many years, there is an experience of losing part of self, which points to an implicit model of self we are holding internally.  \\n\\nJust noticing this self constantly, like a painter looks at a landscape, without even doing any renunciation, is a kind of meditation, - constantly wanting to expand itself by getting objects or winning social approval, or feeling good when achieving something. The word 'Brahman' etymologically comes from 'to expand', so this desire is not condemned in a basic sense, although identifying the self with the body or social narrative about oneself is seen as the confusion which cause pain.\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita's first 6 chapters are about renunciation of fruits of action(not actions themselves) - but when they describe the resulting state - the yogi sees their own self and the Parmatma in all beings. Or to take a more common example, a parent usually doesnt feel bad when an object like a book or a house is taken by their child,  **as the child is seen as a continuation of the self**.\\n\", \"Why I think Hinduism has one of the most enlightened approaches to realization of reality - the problem of solipsism.This post will be based upon this realization that has changed my whole view of the world : **That the resolution to the crisis of solipsism is fundamental unity in all creation, which is parallel to certain notions of “God”.**\\n\\nLet me explain. This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe). It is more like Kashmir Shaivism and other similar traditions.\", \"Advaita Vedanta is a beautifully rich tradition, but I fear it often becomes the most popular choice for people (often westerners) who are simply shopping around for interesting philosophies. \\n\\nRemember to ground your understanding in some sort of real practice or Sadhana, otherwise it's just intellectual gymnastics. \", '[deleted]', \">you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ‘you’ stay in this material world and utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' (the impeccably designed video game).

Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality\\n\\nSo literally doing anything at all goes against non-duality? In which case, Shankara who wrote volumes of literature and spent his entire life debating people would also be pretty non-advaitic. You sound like some edgy nihilist who just discovered buddhism.\\n\\n\\nThe brahman maybe formless but it's not some dead and static inertia where literally nothing happens. In kashmiri shaivism, the idea of constant internal movement - spanda - is the defining characteristic of the highest non-dual reality, as it is of the grossest reality.\", \"Where does the term Sanatana Dharma come from? Do all Hindu traditions actually place importance on the Vedas?I always heard how the word Hinduism is actually a word of foreign origin and is not the real name of the religion, but the real name is Sanatana Dharma in which the different traditions have their basis in their Vedas. How much truth is there in this claim, and where does the term come from?\\n\\nI haven't read Balagangadhara's work that in-depth yet, so I probably have a few things wrong, but what I've read so far is that the concept of Hinduism itself is a colonial construct that was created by the British, and that the concept of Hindu traditions being united by following the Vedas is something that came later so that Hinduism could be a real religion and fit somewhat of an Abrahamic framework. Basically, Abrahamic religions are the only religions, while other forms of practices are traditions.\\n\\nDo all traditions that are classified as Hindu actually value the Vedas, even if it's just lip-service? If not, then what is the basis of the term Sanatana Dharma? Was the concept of Sanatana Dharma actually a thing or was it just an attempt to create a Sanskrit term for Hinduism?\\n\\nThere's a lot of rambling here, so hopefully this makes some sense.\", \"Hinduism did not evolve as a single religion or identity, so no matter what you call it, it will be whimsical. That said, it is a good idea to call ourselves Hindu because it affords a social and political and even economic classification that can be helpful to keep traditions alive and make sure people aren't being preyed on.\", \"To understand what Balu is saying, one first needs to be clear about two themes in discussions - One, we are not talking about the names whichever one you use.(At best, a name can give a hint some shared concept exists, but words can also cause confusion, we can be divided by a common terms with different meanings). Two, he is not saying that 'Hinduism was constructed in the 19th century'. This has been said by a lot of postmodernists etc. \\n\\nInstead the issue is something like this - imagine you have two board games with very different rules and players of board game 1 see board game 2 and because of surface similarities, try to understand it as a variant of game 1. So things which are not seen by game 2 players are seen by game 1 players and some of the basic themes which actually do exist in game 2 are missed.\\n\\nWhat about the game 2 players? Because of the language issue and need to fit into laws designed by game 1 players, another thing happens - either game 1 words are understood by game 2 players in terms of their own concepts while being unaware of their original meaning(ie Indians dont understand western ideas even when using western words for previously existing concepts, ex: 'religion' is understood as dharma), or alternatively, game 2 players lose access to their own previous understanding(unlike the former case, they might actually understand dharma as religion) due to growing up in a new educational environment and game 2 just seems strange and incomprehensible(game 1 rules dont really work for understanding game 2) - why would anyone play it?\\n\\nSo, this is not a question of definition. Imagine, if alien anthropologists discover the chess board game along with extensive records of games. One can easily just go around defining 'chess' in terms of surface features like white pieces and black pieces, the shapes of pieces, 'we have discovered a lot of diversity - in this part of the world, the knight piece  looks different' without developing any understanding. They need to develop a theory of what is going on and test it against extensive record of annotated games.(Slowly discovering piece moves, exceptional things like en passant, when the game ends and so on)\", \"Some Yoga traditions are slient. But they don't go and condemn the Veda either.\\n\\nWell,sanātana dharma is a neologism,but that is not an illegitimate one. Neither is Hindu an illegitimate term.\", 'Your question has three layers. 1. What is religion. 2. Since when Hindus started considering themselves as distinct religious community 3 Usefulness of  definition based on Vedic scriptures. \\n\\n1\\n>  Basically, Abrahamic religions are the only religions, while other forms of practices are traditions.\\n\\nThat would depend on definition of term religion itself right?  Definition of religion has evolved amongst anthropologists in last couple of centuries from definition which was very narrow,  applied to only organised sects. At that time catholicism and various branches of protestants like Lutherans, calvinism, anglicanism were considered separate religions and concept of religious freedom and separation of state and religion etc evolved even though everyone was Christian at that time. Now definition has broadened to something like \\n\\n> Religion is any cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, world views, texts, sanctified places, ethics, or organizations, that relate humanity to the supernatural or transcendental.\\n\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion  It is important to use broad definition of religion and consider Hinduism, Chinese traditional religion, shintoism etc as religions because special legal and social status modern society accords to \"religions\" as opposed to non religious ideologies. Eg Legal sanctions against discrimination based on religion etc. Social sanctions against persecution of someone because of his religion. For example it is socially acceptable to say \"punch a nazi\". It is socially acceptable or even socially required to fire someone for being a nazi even if that person has done no crime ever, participated in no violence and has done nothing more than hold some flag in some rally. While same society takes pains to constantly remind everyone #NotAllMuslims even though Muslim texts contain intolerant statements about Jews and infidels and there are instances of large scale violence by Muslims throughout history. \\n\\n2\\nStart of thinking of Hindus as one religious community definitely precedes British.  You have saints like Kabir preaching unity of \"Hindus and mussalman\". Sikh gurus saying be neither Hindu nor mussalman. These statements etc only make sense if popular conception at that time thought of Hindus and Muslims as two distinct religious communities. Shivaji founding hindavi swarajya,  maratha polity writing letters which show anger at tipu sultan\\'s forced conversion of Hindus in faraway kerala region etc also suggest pan Hindu communal identity in opposition to mussalaman was already in place. Without opposition to Muslims also we see one text describing Hindu as \"worshipper of narayana etc devatas\" . In pre-Islamic times we see division between astika traditions and nastika traditions in philosophical discussions though for ordinary people that division probably wasn\\'t much important. \\n\\n3\\nReason for defining Hindu using \"vedic scriptures\"  (which include scriptures other than Vedas  which accept authority of vedas) is simply practical. All extant non vedic nastika traditions that is Buddhism, jainism and Sikhism have rejected label Hindu. While all other astika organised traditions who accept authority of Vedas call themselves hindu. That leaves lingayats and masses of people who call themselves Hindus but may never have heard of Vedas. While hindu-ness of lingayats is controversial issue. Most of common Hindus who don\\'t belong to any officially vedic sampradaya have beliefs and practices extremely similar to those described in vedic scriptures. It is simply practical to define Hindus using vedic scriptures while being mindful of spectrum of scriptural to folk Hinduism.

'God of universe' vs 'God of man' .If we were to hit a rod onto the surface of a flowing stream, the undivided flow of water seems momentarily divided into two streams. In the evening sky, the moment the first star appears and twinkles, the otherwise unending sky appears to have acquired a point of reference, quadrisected into four cardinal directions.\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0This material world too, in all its eternity, gets divided into two parts as soon as the star of human awareness starts twinkling.\\xa0 Dichotomies like the beautiful and the ugly, the fragrant and the malodorous, the melodious and the harsh to hear, the soft and the hard, the dear and the unpleasant, the good and the bad, the divine and the evil, and others emerge as soon as human need becomes the point of reference in this cosmos. All that humankind considers good, pleasant and helpful is one part of this world while all that is unpleasant, all that unfavorably or adversely affects human existence is the other part of this world. He who creates the good part is “God” while he who creates the bad part is the “Rakshas”, “Asura”, “Satan” or “Devil”. Accepting these elementary human sensibilities as the working criterion for understanding the usefulness, goodness or badness of the cosmos is quite unavoidable.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Our ancestors realised ages ago that it was impossible to count, analyse, characterize and qualify or quantify each and every living species and non-living entity of this immeasurable and unfathomable universe. Instinctively they chose to analyse the things and beings in the universe using the five senses humankind is gifted with- touch, sight, scent, hearing and taste. Now everything had one or more attributes one could, well, “sense”. For example, the rose was red by color, soft to touch and fragrant by scent. While a fruit was sweet or sour by taste, aromatic by scent, cool and wet to touch, with a certain appearance for the eyes. A cuckoo was black to see and sweet to hear. A breeze was cool or warm to feel (to “touch”) while a sea storm was frightening to hear, forceful to feel and salty to smell. Given the primitive times then, this very idea of using the five senses was a veritable leap of human ingenuity! They developed this thought process to call the five senses representatives of the Pancha Maha Bhootas (The Five Great Elements), namely Pruthvi (Earth or the solid state of matter), Aap (Water or the liquid state of matter), Tej (Fire, light energy or radiations), Vaayu (Wind, air or gaseous state of matter) and Aakash (Outer space, vacuum or the Great Void). Spiritually, they theologized that whatever conversation or dialogue we humans could have with the God of this universe was also through these five senses, hence they even developed the concept of the five-headed deities, like Pancha Mukhi Mahadev, Pancha Mukhi Hanuman or Pancha Mukhi Ganesha.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Just as the process of studying the universe and its objects and beings with our five senses was so natural and instinctive, so were the attempts at trying to figure out if there indeed was any psyche behind the very forces who could create this universe. These forces were deified and became objects of faith across ancient cultures. The thought that came forward was that by creating this bounty and abundance of natural wealth for human prosperity, Nature was indeed very kind-hearted and affectionate like a mother who provided for her children, us human beings. Nature was\\xa0Mother\\xa0Nature,\\xa0Mother\\xa0Earth,\\xa0Mother\\xa0Life, the Goddess “Srushti” or “Prakruti”, who tended to us her children. By psyche she was all that a mother could be- affectionate, loving and providing. This “faith” has only been reinforced from time to time by the gifts Mother Nature has been showering onto us from time and again onto humankind till today! Likewise the Creator was Father Creator, the powerful “Purusha”, who though so powerful was yet, by psyche, so kind, gentle, caring and compassionate that He laid the very seed of human existence and a habitat to sustain human life!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Truly, for the benefit, utility and happiness of humankind, the compassionate God has created nature with such meticulous paternal love! This sun, this ocean, how majestically big these Great Elements! But the kind God employed even them for the service of humankind. Just as a mother would keep cool sweet water filled up for her kids coming home from their play out in the afternoon sun, so does the “Sun-God”, using sunrays as suction conduits, suck up only the water sans the salt from the salty oceans thereby sparing the sweet water of the rivers – and then store up this distillate in heavenly reservoirs, making it tempting even to the Gods! Just imagine the control mechanism over this saltwater-to-Sweetwater conversion – only as much capacity is there in the sunrays for this conversion as is the water required in one year and only as much is the water storage capacity of the celestial reservoirs- the clouds. At the same time, the oceans are themselves not turned sweet, sparing our whole life from becoming tastelessly bland!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Look at the animals! They are of various calibers of intelligence and various specializations, as varied as the varieties of services humankind expected of them in the pre-industrial ages! The Gods taught the camels the art of eating desert thorns and going without water for days, adapting them to life in a desert habitat – and they became the ship of the desert, a lifeline for sustaining human life in the inhospitable harsh desert! And how swift is the horse! God has given him strength and forbearance to both gallop for hours and to manoevour in the midst of a pitched battle all the time balancing and bearing the weight of a human rider for hours. There are many examples of steadfast loyalty where horses have even sacrificed their life for their masters, like the horse Chetak who carried Rana Pratap to safety before dying of exhaustion. Yet God has not over endowed the horse with the intelligence to ride a human being instead. Take the dairy cow or buffalo - one just has to push dry grass from one end to get rich, creamy, fresh, life-giving milk in abundance from the other end. Really, how kind God must be to his human children for creating such a biochemical process as milk formation! What’s more - God endowed the same dairy cow or buffalo that produces milk with the ability to leave behind her own progeny, a reproduced copy, with the very same miraculous biochemical abilities to turn dry unpalatable inedible grass into sweet, creamy milk before she retires or passes away. A milk-vending machine that vends not just milk but also another milk-vending machine!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0One has to sow just one grain of wheat - and it turns into a plant producing more than a hundred grains! Just\\xa0one\\xa0mango – a divinely juicy, delicious, nutritious, pulpy fruit – but it comes with its own seed that if sown and nurtured, turns into a majestic tree that gives\\xa0hundreds\\xa0of juicy mangoes for generations of a human family, year after year. Not just that, the mango even appears by branch grafting, producing whole orchards after orchards of the noble fruit in veritable abundance! Rice, millet or other varieties of different foodgrains with different nutrient profiles and tastes grow in all sorts of climatic conditions – in each case, one gets a whole sack full from one single, sowed grain. The varieties of fruits- pomegranates, bananas, apples, figs, jackfruits, dates… from different climatic profiles follow the same law - just\\xa0one\\xa0sown seed supplies enough fruit for satisfying the needs of at least a small family! All sorts of tasty, nutritious vegetables grow by themselves when kind of “ordered” by the mere act of being sown – the Lord God made this possible for us his human children! Then there’s sugarcane, after all a mere grass – with its weed-like propensity to proliferate wherever water is available. But when humans discovered its sweet juice, it just had to be disciplined into growing within the space allotted to it and nurtured by irrigation before it grew into vast lush stretches of such a generous produce that after being squeezed of its last drop of sweet juice by industrial scale sugar extraction processes, can still provide basic roughage to field oxen from leftovers! In fact, today’s scientists in the field of unconventional energy resources are researching the possibility of employing crops like sugarcane and even weeds from hillsides to generate the bio-fuel ethanol just when the world thought its fossil fuels were getting used up! Truly, when one resource dries up, another becomes available! How\\xa0can\\xa0we humans\\xa0ever\\xa0even quantify, leave alone repay, the kindness that God showered on humankind, making arrangements for every aspect of human existence!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0And what about human anatomy!\\xa0 From the soles of our feet to the most microscopic of the organelles of the brain, the layout of the human body is full of masterly, orderly planning and co-ordination- O Lord, how meticulously Thou hath designed our bodies for us! Our\\xa0human\\xa0eye- how many ages, eons, generations of evolutionary experiments hath Thou conducted to bring our eye to its present capabilities? Initially the eye was just a nervous tissue able to merely make out a ray of light, which could only differentiate illumination from utter darkness, recognize a shadow more than actual details of a form; but by continuous evolutionary experiments, trials and errors, we humans now have our beautiful, spherical, moist – and –\\xa0ambitious\\xa0human eye. Today the human eye is so capable that we humans have the ambitious foresight(!) to beat Thee at Thy own game, by inventing a duplicate eye, an extension, the telescope, to view not just the interiors of Thy own cosmic laboratory of outer space, but to discover none other than\\xa0Thee Thyself\\xa0 somewhere in space!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Further, how\\xa0can\\xa0one ever describe fully the festival of beauty and colours Thou hath conducted in the Three Worlds? The ultra-delicate flower of the Parijaat, the ultra-fragrant Golden Champak flower! The peacock’s vibrant plumage – the colors and design of every feather, the peacock’s inimitable gait! What a natural artist that noble bird is! When I watch the bird spread his plumage, dance with excitement and cry out aloud, believe me, O God, even my heart dances in sync with every step of this gifted bird and cries out Thy glory in admiration of Thy divine creation. In fact, I feel like sulking that\\xa0I\\xa0do not have the wonderful plumage of the peacock. The whole earthly creation resounds with the songs of birds and is a kaleidoscope of pleasant sights and landscapes! Roses, chamelis, bakulis, Juhis, Jaais, Champak, sandalwood, Ketakis… creepers and shrubs in full bloom, whole gardens full of them freshening and lending fragrance to the atmosphere! The Gods of love, Madan and Rati, are busy linking the hearts of lovers! The nights are starry, the dawns are pink, youth is confident and fresh, sleep is sound and deep, and love is like a cool breeze heralding the rhapsody of springtime. There is material and spiritual growth all over… O Lord, how can we humans not help thinking that such a beautiful world was created specially for us by Thee? If we love, nurture, protect and provide for our children, so doth Thee. Thou truly art both our father and mother and we Thy children. Even the milk our mothers give us is given ultimately by you. O Lord, we are Thy devotees and Thou, the Lord God of humankind, the God of Man!\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Not just that, Thou art the only God, there can be no other and Thou hath created this world specifically for our peace and prosperity!\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0… This ideology, this concept of “The God of humankind” creating the universe specially for the survival and prosperity of Humankind could indeed have proved truthful and correct – if and only if everything, every being and all conditions in this world would have been only helpful, pleasant, beneficial and useful to humankind.\\xa0\\nBut alas! The cold fact is that most of this earth, the very earth we instinctively consider Mother Earth, Mother Nature and Mother Life is hardly all that safe, protective, kind and considerate to us humans as we were just philosophizing. On the contrary, the living conditions existent on this planet and influences of the atmosphere, the sun, moon and stars in reality seem to contradict our pet theory of faith too much – conditions that obtain on earth are mostly inhospitable, harsh, with the law of the Jungle working all the time around us. Humankind has to struggle for its very survival and struggle still further for ensuring prosperity.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Take a good look at the very Sun and oceans we sung paeans in praise of just some time ago. The way the unsparing rays of the hot sun finish off a helpless victim of sunstroke or heatstroke is quite comparable to the ruthlessness with which a gatekeeper watchman beats a poisonous snake by repeated relentless blows- striking the final blows even when half-dead. In the very India where millions of Hindu Brahmins offer prayers to the Sun God every sunrise and sunset, the very same sun shines hot for the entire spell of a drought or famine, even lasting several years, killing thousands of heatstroke, hunger or thirst.\\xa0\\nIn the Quran, Talmud, Torah and Bible, devout prophets sang in praise of God Yahweh, “For us Humans, O God, Thee hath kept a plentiful supply of fish for us to eat in the oceans!” But the same oceans are also full of creatures like human-eating sharks which can eat a human body alive and whole. The oceans are also teeming with other forms of sea life like poisonous snakes, sting rays, electric rays and the Portuguese-Man-of-war which can either kill, maim or in any other way seriously harm any human form in sea-water – a swimmer or diver, a shipwrecked sailor, a fisherman, marine biologist or oceanologist – the ocean Gods are quite busy nurturing these forms of life harmful to man with sustained impartiality. Quite similar to a mugger who first poses as a traveler’s guide, then waits for an opportune time to shed his mask to finally loot his trusting quarry in the middle of nowhere, the ocean, while carrying afloat thousands of rafts, boats and vessels at a time, suddenly throws some of them off its back and into its terrible jaws to swallow up entire vessels and ocean liners like the doomed Titanic, drowning all the thousands of people aboard in one gulp. Oceans can unpredictably erupt into tsunamis sucking entire populations of coastal settlements into their watery graves.\\xa0\\nRivers in Africa, Australia and South America are full of potentially human-eating creatures like alligators, piranha and crocodiles. The holy rivers, on whose banks civilizations and cities flourished, can swallow up entire townships or at least several thousand helpless people and animals in one spate, be they the Holy Mother Ganges or Jamnaji, the Brahmaputra, Hwang-Ho or Nile, the Holy Jordan or the Father Thames.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Primitive Semitic devotion believed in the Abrahamic Books that the Elohim (Yahweh of the Bible and Allah of the Quran) created the goat, lamb, deer and other creatures so that his believers would get lots of meat to eat! But the devotion with which the believer smacks his lips on seeing “food” animals blinds him to the obvious fact that the same world in which he resides with his “food” animals is also home to potentially man-eating animals like the big wild cats, crocodiles, bears and sharks. If a man-eating Sunderban Royal Bengal tiger preys on an unsuspecting human child and is spotted smacking his lips after devouring the child’s flesh, should we say that God created small human children with tender flesh just so that some man-eater can have a delicious meal? And as if to provide icing on a cake, the world has its share of dangerous vegetarian beasts as well, from the very herbivorous African river hippos that can cut a human form into two in one snap of their jaws (just as easily as we crunch a slice of cucumber at our dinner table), to the grass-munching land giants like the bison or Assamese rhinos and ultimately the largest land mammal, the\\xa0 solitary bull African elephants all of whom are known to kill humans more often than do the carnivorous big cats. \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0When a tsunami strikes a coast, it sucks in everything it can from coastal human inhabitation- brides in their own wedding ceremonies about to garland their grooms, mothers suckling their meek hungry and vulnerable infants, artists with unfinished paintings and sculptures, lovers locked mid-ardor oblivious to the world, devotees in mid-meditation with spiritual ecstasy… entire cities like Dwarika and Atlantis, regions and subcontinents have gone under water, got buried under volcanic lava like Pompeii… as quickly as Ganesh devotees immerse a Ganesh idol in the sea – with cataclysmic precision. And yet, the next daybreak, the same Dawn Goddess Usha, who was soulfully venerated with sacred chants of the Vedas, appears as pink as always over the destruction.\\xa0\\nThe Quran quotes that Allah created the moon so that the believer could tell the parts of the day to know when to offer namaz. But when the “infidel’ Chengiz Khan stormed Baghdad, the cultural capital of Islamdom, massacring all Momins in his wake, slaughtering clerics and the Caliph with his family, demolishing the whole city, razing all buildings and walking over a pile of cut heads of killed Muslims, did not the moon still rise over the same Baghdad that night too, informing the namaz-hating Chengiz Khan about the times of the day just as it did the namaz-performing Muslims?\\xa0\\n\\nFragrant flowers, melodiously singing songbirds, the haughty peacock with his inimitable plumage, even entire forests get roasted alive in a single bushfire or forest fire, like we roast a brinjal on a flame. \\nWhile a human population trustingly plays the game of life in the daytime and rests secure every night in the lap of Mother Earth, some particular moment the same terra firma demolishes the unsuspecting population with one earthquake tremor – buildings get flattened, both huts and architecturally marvelous monuments of human creativity and civilisation, like a pack of cards ceases to exist. Entire villages can be swallowed alive in a moment with the same earth opening up a giant crevice in an earthquake!\\xa0\\nHistorically giant meteors have hit the earth and in some cases, even set in massive cycles of climatic change and destruction with extinctions of entire species. Can a flaming comet also not suddenly appear out of the blue (from outer space) and hit the surface of the earth setting ablaze entire regions much like a flaming torch can set ablaze a whole pile of cotton?\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0For every lifestyle there exists a dysfunction. The human body, when diseased, is a museum of pathologies and pain- furuncles, epilepsy, tumours, agony, coma, palpitations, diabetes and heart arrests… The world out there has its rounds of bubonic plagues, famines, cholera epidemics …\\xa0\\nOur faith and belief that humankind is the centre of reference for the whole universe and that not just\\xa0our own\\xa0planet - the earth with her plentiful resources and life forms - but the whole\\xa0cosmos\\xa0was created by God\\xa0only\\xa0for humankind,\\xa0only\\xa0to favour humankind,\\xa0only\\xa0to provide pleasure to humankind and\\xa0only\\xa0out of special partisan fondness for humankind, eventually crystallized into belief systems, some open to contrary thought and other times closed to alternative view-points, like unbending dogma unwilling to confront rationalism. We humans even created religious texts of this dogma, selectively only documenting phenomena supportive of our theory that God first manufactures and then employs even stars, planets, comets, black holes, galaxies and constellations exclusively for sustaining human existence, protecting human life, providing fun, pleasure and entertainment to humans and eternally providing resources to human civilization, happiness and prosperity. This blinkered approach has only blinded us to stark, obvious natural phenomena and unpleasant observations of accidents and natural catastrophes endured by humankind that contradict our doctrine of “God’s Creation for human welfare”. We have to free ourselves of the shackles of this dogmatic conditioning to outgrow our primary assumption and adopt the approach of unbiased reasoning and dispassionate analysis to explain observations both pleasant and unpleasant.\\xa0\\n\\nFaith in this God-of-man theory can best be treated as a development of the primitive emotional human mind at its most innocent, childlike, seeking state. Faith created scripture - we can even marvel at the poetic expressions and emotional inputs that created some devotional scripture. We can pragmatically and patiently hear out, even study with interest all religious, devotional and ritualistic versions of the same God-of-man belief across the world as necessary stepping stones in the evolution of the human mind. Not all scriptures are unbending dogma. Some scriptures and cultures like the Indic (Bhakti-Vedantic, Buddhistic and Jain), Greek, Egyptian (Pre-Arian and Arian) and Far Eastern (Taoist, Confucian, Shinto) showed a readiness to discuss alternate viewpoints freely, while other types of scriptures like the Bible and Quran show the otherwise seeking human mind trapped at some primitive stage of thought not amenable to reasoning, with self-imposed fossilization, in the evolution of human thought processes.\\nIt is\\xa0completely beyond\\xa0human reasoning powers to deduce the real intention due to which or without which this cosmos came into existence even with the best of telescopes, space exploration technology, knowledge of physics and mathematics – or with the most insightful of meditative techniques. We can only reason this much – the world and cosmos are not specially created for man; man matters little to other space bodies, whatever our earthly human thoughts - theist or atheist, scientific or devotional. We humans are only as significant in the big universe as may be some other creature- some worm, germ, bug or bee. In other words, humans are no more than a very ordinary, temporary production in the eternal flow of time and the incessant dynamics of the universe.\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Thus, crops do not grow, fruits do not ripen or spices are not delicious so that humankind should be fed good food. Crops grow, hence humans can eat them – that’s all. Rivers do not flow because humankind needs water- on the contrary; we happen to get water because rivers flow. Even when it was the age of the dinosaurs before the evolution of modern humans, rivers had been flowing, flowers were blooming, the stars were twinkling – just as they do so now! Even when the earth was under the grip of the ice age, or even before the very birth of earth, this very own home planet - the sun had its cosmic motion unfazed by anything else. Why, even if this very\\xa0sun\\xa0or our very own Milky Way were to vanish, the rest of the cosmos would be probably as affected as the luminosity of daylight is affected by the death of a firefly. Such an unfazed, unperturbed cosmic power that would not elicit even a moment’s mourning by the sudden nemesis of a hundred suns or solar systems even on a daily basis\\xa0can\\xa0still be venerated as “God” (to satiate human spiritual hunger) but slightly differently - as the “God of the universe” - certainly not as our older conception of “God of Humankind”.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0If our “God of Humankind” would\\xa0not\\xa0have provided even\\xa0elementary\\xa0aids of survival, some minimal resources to exploit or primitive conditions of protection from the wild side of nature, could anyone or anything have stopped Him from disallowing any human existence? Yet, the human race\\xa0did\\xa0get access to natural bounty as comprehended by our five elementary human senses,\\xa0could\\xa0exploit resources and\\xa0could\\xa0modify circumstances to make quite a few habitats hospitable to human survival.\\xa0 Not only did humans survive, they prospered into civilizations. They did not just get a world, they got a rich earth, with rivers of water, edible foods, and useful animals – with fragrant flowers, scenic beauty and melodiously singing birds added in to enliven existence. The human race has eventually flourished so far, certainly not perished!\\nYet, this appearance of human life on earth, juxtaposed in the evolutionary history of the earth, itself juxtaposed in the eternal universal upheaval of creation, sustenance and destruction, is no more than a speck in time, a temporary, ordinary and miniscule event not worth reckoning in the largely unknown, unfathomable history of the universe. Whatever dependability nature has shown with whatever few conditions encouraging human existence on this planet earth, are\\xa0merely a coincidence. So long as this coincidence lasts, so long as we survive as humans, we humans can term this coincidence, this favorable set of circumstances, the “God of Humankind”; we can even offer Him a flower out of devotion and gratitude. To this, and only to this limited extent, can we condescend to say that the “God of Humankind” is kind to, partial towards and protective of his human “children”.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Mentally envisaging the “God of the universe” is merely going logically further in our God-conceptualization exercise. There are two techniques, scientific and spiritual, essentially complementary to each other. Scientifically, we have space shuttles and telescopes augmenting the eye, to note birth of stars or their celestial burial in black holes. Spiritually, ancients reached yogic contemplative planes like Saptapatal, Brahmalok, Vishnulok, Devalok, etc. through meditation augmenting the inner mind. Either way, the universe (or the “God” of the universe) is uninfluenced by prayers, unperturbed by human emotions, unaffected by human birth or death, prosperity or tragedy, too abstract to be affected by anything, partial towards no one, certainly not humans, is equally responsible for both genesis and nemesis. Neither does this power purposefully bless us, nor purposefully punish us. This “God of the universe” is too subtle and omnipotent to be a personality like a jealous Old Testament Yahweh who vindictively resorts to curses against and punishments like sending locusts and frogs against bonded followers trespassing into worshipping alternate God-forms.\\xa0 The power of the “God of the universe” is also not thanks to some seat or tag of authority, like is the case of the celestial Indra (whose power being not his own but by virtue of the\\xa0throne\\xa0of the “ruler of heaven-residing deities”), who insecurely presupposes that anyone engrossed in meditation, sage or demon alike, can get strong enough to usurp his throne and depose him. The “God of the universe” requires no medium like angrily foaming prophets whose careers were nothing more than haranguing people into remaining bonded to the Old Testament books of dogma by issuing dire warnings, or mysterious secretive shamanic witch-doctors sacrificing poor animals to entities like demons and spirits in occult rituals while mumbling to themselves in a state of mind bordering on epilepsy, creating a whole plethora of lesser Gods, demi-Gods and other entities taking their toll tax from a seeker on a spiritual quest on the way towards the real God unluckily trespassing onto their domain of esoteric teritory. The God of the universe could freely be “He”, “She”, even “It” - we don’t know, we can call this force what we want.\\n\\nConceptualising God of this nature requires not just intellectual effort but also spiritual courage. We now have a God to bow before but we must learn to take care of ourselves in individual and collective crises in life within the framework of natural laws,\\xa0praakrutik dharma. If one is the captain of a sinking ship, one should use all knowledge in navigation and ship mechanics to save the ship, passengers and cargo first – all prayers to the God of the ship or the God of the Seas or the God of humankind are only\\xa0after\\xa0all realistic efforts are instituted. Like vitamin B complex helping the main medicine fight an illness, rather than becoming the medicine itself denying other specific medicines the credit of working. Thus the God of humankind is nothing other than one side, namely the bright, congenial side - the feel-good factor - of the God of the Universe. Whether the devotionally conceived God of Humankind partial to humankind or the intellectually conceptualized God of the Universe partial towards no one, we can treat every conception with respect, since we term the conception “God”. Particularly when we have first respected the “God of humankind” and then pulled Him into the morass of half-baked notions of devotion, the “God of the universe” deserves greater respect.\\nWe first invested the conception of the God of humankind with human emotions and personalities, good and bad traits, then invoked Him (or Her) to account for each and every positive or negative personal event and gradually, pulled down Divinity into the mud, demoted the stature of our conception of “divinity” into an entity that serves our selfish interests and base desires by ordinary bribes of prayer. The bigger our personal desire, the more flamboyant or expectant our prayer gets - the “God of Humankind” would do us good if we conduct some sacrificial rite, organize a Satyanarayana Pooja, attend successive masses of Novena or repeatedly visit a fakir’s mausoleum. Imagining any covenant with the “God of Humankind” simply ties us up in illogical knots - if we offer prayers of gratitude to God for saving us from danger, then who presented us with these dangers in the first place? The same “God”! First He slits our neck and then He heals it. If we should worship Him for healing us, should we also not full-fledgedly blame Him first for hurting us? It is like the story of two roadside beggars fighting amongst each other saying, “I am right, you are wrong” and desperately but unsuccessfully trying to get the judgment of superiority from an emperor whose retinue passing momentarily by their way – the emperor does not even notice, the convoy passes ahead and the two beggars go back to wrestling each other in the muck. Well, invoking the “God of Humankind” for these twin emotional outbursts of blaming and thanking, for every worthless and inconsequential event of life, is worse than the fight of these two roadside beggars. The age and limits of our universe are too big to even be measured - human devotional tantrums do not matter at all.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0What is\\xa0rational\\xa0is that we can study, infer, discover, analyse, comprehend, teach each other and then recode for posterity the\\xa0laws\\xa0by which the universe and its components exist, govern themselves and act or interact. We can then try and align ourselves with the laws of the functioning of nature and the universe in ways beneficial to the human race, conducive to our survival. This is the only thing possible for us humans. Thus any act, behaviour or conduct of a human being conducive and helpful to the survival of the whole human race and to our habitat (the earth and “her” environment) in the long term is\\xa0good, ethical and correct\\xa0behaviour. On the contrary, any thought or conduct that can make us perish or destroy our own habitat, anything that can adversely affect human survival or can be a deterrent to long-term human survival of our human habitat is\\xa0bad, unethical and incorrect\\xa0behaviour. This definition of human ethics is workable, rational and clear to understand. But beliefs like “What ‘God’ likes is ethical” and “That which is helpful to Humans is liked by God” are untrue and untenable, in fact too childish to sustain. We need to realize that we are part of the universe, but the universe is not ours or ruled by us. To a negligible extent the universe favours us. To a much greater extent, the universe is unfavourable to us. Accepting this truth clearly, bravely and unhesitatingly is being both human and humane. And this is the true religion of the entire human race, the true worship of the “God of the universe”.\", 'Really profound but lengthy post.', ' the purusharth of veer savarkar ji is an inspiration.\\n\\nHis whole life is a testament to the power of sheer will.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha.

For one definition we know Dharm means righteousness. If Krishn's Dharm means righteousness then what does he mean by righteousness. Is it the righteousness of action, or the results? In the Mahabharat Kaurav took the land and exiled Pandav. Kaurav basically symbolize a behaviour which is to be considered as bad and many a times abhorrent. Not respecting the women, confiscating properties, later refusing to return what's not theirs, breaking laws, not being Just despite being the rulers, trying to kill their family members and many more thing I might not be aware of. This is to be punished and maybe this is what Krishna means. Maybe justice is the idea of Krishn's version of Dharm.   My primary argument was that Krishna did many of the acts which can be associated with trickery, deceit and slyness. But he did everything to bring justice. He's like the one of the most Griffindors in the Griffindor house, break the rules to do good. Like Harry, Hermione and Ron would break the rules to to do good here Krishna is doing just the same. The good should rule not matter the means.  The major antagonist in the story is Duryodhan, he is the source of all the conflict and rest of the characters in Kaurav's side revolve around the whims and wishes of this character. If this person was eliminated from the story the basis of whole Mahabharat would collapse. Naturally Dhritrastr would return the land and Kingdom to the Pandav brothers, may even the whole kingdom.   So, Duryodhan is the biggest plot point of the story. But there's one more plot point which is as much important. And it is  Kurn. Despite Krishna's knowledge that he was son of Kunti he did not allow Kurn to participate in Draupadi's Swayamvar for the obvious reasons that Krishn wanted Draupadi to marry Arjun and not Kurn. Why would Krishn do that? Krishn being a god knew the future can was well aware about the war. He was who took it to the level of war. Had he wanted he'd have killed Duryodhan long back during Draupadi cheerharan and punished Pandav brothers to use Draupadi in the game, all in the name of Dharm.  The point is, if you are an omniscient being where you could do anything, you are the one who is running the game. The war was not a result of one but a number of incidents, of which the omniscient being was part of many. It is not wrong to say that the war was Krishn's will.  But why? Answer is maybe the whole point of designing the situations which would lead to war is to set an example. The example to show the world that in the way of being righteous even if you have to kill your family members it's the right thing to do.\", 'What is Hinduism iSo what I learned in school about Hinduism is basically reincarnation and they believe in lots of gods also they cant eat meat.

Btw, if you don\\'t want to read my backstory, just skip to the bottom. I don\\'t suggest it though, because I have the feeling that someone is supposed to read this, and this is all meant to be happening for a reason.\\n\\n\\nOkay, my first step in this post is going to be describing to you a brief td;lr of my life, and then a more detailed explanation of what\\'s been happening to me for the past 3 or so weeks.\\n\\nOkay, for the TD;LR of my life:\\nParents were always strict Christians, but I denied it all my life and followed my instincts, trying things, studying, meditating, praying, ext. I was always insanely interested in knowledge, history in specific, and spirituality even more.\\n\\nI\\'ve spent the last 2 - 3 or so years (I\\'m 18 years old as of writing this), I\\'ve been focusing on spirituality in a very hardcore manner (even more serious than everything from before combined), studying constantly, spending all my time either meditating or studying. I\\'ve studied Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Taoism, and many Nordic beliefs, and finally Satanism (not Christian\\'s version. There\\'s a form of Satanism that has nothing to do with Christianity, and teaches similar ideas to Hinduism. I thought that was it for me, because it preached about you growing your own soul through meditation, yoga, using energy to open your soul, see into the Psychic realm (non-human beings), open your chakras and to unite the female and male sides of your soul, with the ultimate goal being raising your Kundalini serpent past the last chakra and achieving Godhood yourself. I know what I was doing 100% had some effect, but in the end I realized it was only an illusion too, with only hints of truth to distract you from the truth. I came to peace with that, and it took me a very, very, very long time to do that completely.\\n\\n\\nWARNING: In this next section I am going to explain my experiences over the last three weeks, and how it has changed me into a different man, along with some general backround knowledge. During these three weeks ONLY, I was basically under the influence of Marijuana, but I would like to remind all of you, that mind altering substances have been used as a helping hand in spiritual growth for millennia, including Hinduism. I have no further desire for the substance, and will never touch it again. However, I do not regret doing it. Because of my choices, here I am today, and I regard these three weeks as an experience given to me by a higher power, and I\\'d like to explain that.\\n\\nA lot of symbolic things happened that has relevance to Hinduism. For example, the entire three weeks, I would play Overwatch, meditate, and sleep. I ate maybe four or five times the entire three weeks (not because of the fact that I thought I had to starve myself, I just genuinely didn\\'t need to). I felt a strong draw to my PS4 specifically, not for the game, not for the console, but for use as a conduit in ways. I look at it, and yes, it appears to be a PS4, but I can see so much more on the flip-side. It is a tool to connect you to people and to compete. During these 3 weeks, I would play Zenyatta on Overwatch to represent myself going through a spiritual journey, and as I would take the next steps in this journey, I would become better at playing him. And then I started to think, maybe me playing Overwatch on my PS4 is proving my skill on another level of existance? Or triggering something in the future, past, or in a parallel reality?\\n Because I didn\\'t play Overwatch in a traditional sense. I used my emotions to fuel my skill. It was like I was using my mind to control the controller directly, no longer needing to use my body to move, just dictating my body commands from a different perspective. What I would do was force myself to feel a specific way, depending on what the scenario needed. If we were losing a checkpoint, I would fuel all of the rage inside of me into defending it, always focusing on the objective. And I would destroy. Imagining past battles in history, imagining the pain that people had to deal with, everything. I channeled whatever feeling the situation needed into the situation.\\n\\nI started to get noticed, and then something weird started happening that marked the start of this long 3 week journey. I was in Quick Play, and I was talking to this boy, maybe 14, or 15 years old? And he bore a striking resemblance to me when I was younger. For the entire journey after meeting him, almost every single game I would play in Overwatch, would have him in it, without me inviting him, having him as a friend, or anything. Just random matches, but always the same person under a different name. I even ran into him on the PC edition of the game. Remember earlier when I said symbolism with the beliefs of Hinduism? It\\'s like the same scenario with Shiva. You revere Shiva as the only God, but there are many others that lead to him, and just like that system of beliefs, I always ran into this boy.\\n\\n\\nSo I thought to myself, he has to be my guide, right? This has to be it.\\nI started meditating on it and was thinking about it, and came to the conclusion (I was a Satanist at the time as described earlier) that Satan was trying to guide me towards a path of enlightening the world, a path in which everyone would leave material desires behind and embracing a life of peace and true wisdom. But over the three weeks, I realized, there was no such thing happening (not in the way I thought anyways) ~~ I meditated for nearly 12 hours a day, ate only 4 or 5 times total the entire 3 weeks, and had absolutely no short term memory. There were days were I was so disconnected from myself, that I didn\\'t even know who I was or what I was, moving like a robot with no goals, nothing. It became hard to exist, hard to think, hard to speak, hard to interact with the world. I was in seclusion for weeks, and it was almost like controlling my body from a higher point of view. Like in a RTS game, controlling an entire squad at once for example. I felt like one of the soldiers ready to die for the cause. Coming to peace with everything took awhile, but I came to the point where I left the world behind completely in my own mind, and I was ready to start a new life with a new name and complete this journey. I gave many tests to this spiritual force, and many things did happen. I realized now it had not been Satan guiding me, but something else. And then I looked into Hinduism out of nowhere (it popped into my head randomly) and saw how Shiva is regarded. And I did further research and discovered the belief that all different paths all lead to the same thing. And there was SOOOO much Symbolism in those three weeks happening with the exact same idea. And I gained the ability (limited at this point in the story) to see (not really with my eyes, kind of like a mental awakening) more truly than ever before. I look at my monitor now, and don\\'t see a TV exactly, I see that it can be many things, and be used for many things. While I was on this spiritual journey, I noticed also that there was a full moon every night. I didn\\'t realize it at first, but I counted at least 6 days where there were full moons (which is impossible?). I would sleep during the day and wake up at night, meditate, meditate, and hone my hand eye coordination with Overwatch (right now I have basically aimbot level skill with Zenyatta). I used Overwatch as a tool to dig up my deepest feelings basically in a sense (the feelings I had suppressed when I was very young). When I would get killed, I would be furious, and then I would try to amplify that feeling, and try to come back and get revenge, and it worked a few times, but then it just made me worse and worse in skill. And I realized at that moment, that I had to come to peace with myself, that I needed to live life not driven by greed or selfish desires. So I meditated, and I asked myself, why does it make you bad? And I figured out something I never thought I would. While meditating, I started to see things clearly, with distractions pushed to the side. I realized I wanted to not only be important, but I wanted to serve, and bring peace to the world in any way I could. And I was angry because I was suppressing that, not knowing what I wanted to do with my life at all, going from job to job not happy. Even now, I still dream of a world where people can leave greed aside and focus on the spiritual truths of life, living a simplistic yet rewarding life. But then, this triggered an even deeper awakening of my mind, and I started to see the duality in every action of life, every decision. I started to realize things, and see deep on levels I never thought possible. Let\\'s say you walk to the fridge with the goal of getting some water, but then you decide you don\\'t want water in the end? What happens to that thought? What happens to that possibility, that alternate choice? I believe in the principle of duality ~ harmony and chaos. But I also believe there is a middle ground beyond harmony and chaos, a grey zone. What if I could experience all of the possibilities in my previous example? What if with all of those lost memories, forgotten in time, there is a way to bring it back and experience it, to keep it as part of you and to grow from it, to let it guide you? Have you ever thought about ancient humanity, the day to day life of people, their rituals, their way of life. I have, and I wish I could learn everything, and be a voice that continues the traditions going.\\n\\nI\\'m someone that desires knowledge more than anything, particularly about spirituality. I devoted my life to nothing but the study of truth long ago, and that\\'s what led me here today. I do believe in the principle of duality, but I also do believe in an even greater state of being. A combination of chaos and peace, using it for each situation as a guide. It may not be possible in this life, but my goal is to learn everything, simply put. I want to know everything about everything, no matter the cost to me, physically, mentally, or spiritually. Everything I\\'ve been through has left me with a burning passion that is more powerful than any obstacle. I say now that I will learn everything, and I will defy what I know, because think about it. In this situation, you can choose the middle ground, but there are instances I believe in which you can change what the middle ground actually is, incorporating duality itself into the middle ground that Buddha spoke about. And I believe this is one of those scenarios. Yes, I can choose to know everything, yes, I can choose to know nothing. But what if I want to know everything, and nothing at the same time? To look at existence itself from a 3rd party view, to see it all, be able to experience it, to experience time out of sequence, to be able to relive everything like watching a recorded movie. What if I want to spiritually grow and go past levels of existence even comprehendable by myself (and trust me, I can comprehend a lot of stuff) ~~ But still remember moments like this that defined that journey? Me writing this post, my dog laying on my couch, it being nice and sunny outside but not too hot, and to be able to incorporate even simple memories like this, and experience true knowledge, wisdom, logic, into teachings, in order to expand the minds of others?\\n\\nWhat I desire the most, is to be a servant to truth itself. Making it be known, all illusions aside. To lift the veil that\\'s been cursing humanity for many, many years.\\n\\nI realize this sounds weird, but I have the feeling that Shiva was guiding me in one way or another, because there were a lot of things that happened during this journey. While I thought it was Satan guiding me, at least I knew it was something, and now I realize it could have been Shiva in a different form. There were many days were I felt dead inside during these three weeks. I renounced everything and left it behind, trying to take the path of complete peace and abandon chaos. I realize now, that it\\'s impossible. For peace to exist, there must be struggle. It\\'s all part of the journey. It was very painful, not clinging to emotions, leaving everything behind. I felt like a robot, with no purpose. And then my memory started to go down the drain, and it came to the point were I had no memory, I had no identity, I had nothing. I realized then when I left everything behind that I was clinging onto delusions, and I had to take the middle path, as there cannot be life without death, on any level of existence. I thought I had to die physically. I\\'d convinced myself, I\\'d lay down in my bed, go to sleep, and whatever God existed would make it so I would wake up in another life. I talked in my head with someone and said, will I die tonight when I go to sleep? And that person said \"Yes, but not in the way you expect.\" I could see him too, in a way. Like... A picture hidden behind a veil. He honestly looked like Gandhi, minus the glasses and a bit younger looking than photographs online show, and standing straight up. I woke up the next day and thought of it all as fake and said forget life and gave up. And my mind crumbled into Chaos. I knew at the time my spiritual beliefs were a deception, and I said I\\'m finally done living. I got to the point where I accepted death, embraced the feelings of nothingness and savored it, almost getting turned on in a sadistic way by the thoughts of the many ways I could die. But then when it never happened, it triggered something in me that not only destroyed me physically, mentally, and spiritually, it awakened me, and I rebuilt from the rubble of my old weak mind. There was a point where there was nothing. And I meditated, because I wanted to feel something. Then I came to the conclusion I didn\\'t need to die, and I wasn\\'t going to yet. Before, I thought my purpose was to die, be reincarnated into a new life, and save the world spiritually in a sense (true Satanists believe in reincarnation also) ~ but then I realized, the goal was never to die physically. Through this entire journey, something was guiding me, telling me exactly what to do, what to say, what to feel. I felt like a slave, trapped in a body, wanting to move on. And then I meditated, and I thought about my suffering, and thought about why I wanted to die so bad truly, and then the illusions started slipping away, and peace started to come back. And in that instant, it was like that previous life of mine had been destroyed, and I finally found my way to the middle path. It triggered a feeling in me of death on all levels, including mentally. I thought I was completely dead on every level, but then I started to meditate, and think, and use my experiences in the past as a guide, like putting together a puzzle. I realized, what I wanted to do with my life was truly dedicate myself to my study, and to help spread knowledge and wisdom. I wanted to be the black sheep that would take all of the pain, and show everyone the true way, the \"easy\" way. But then I realized the duality with my next awakening. Ignorance is a bliss, and the path of knowledge is not for everyone, and I realized then that there was no \"easy\" way. I realized that yes, I\\'ve been through a journey all of my life, but so has everyone else, and so will everyone else. And while I may be able to guide people the right direction, it will be on them to find peace within themselves. No God, no person, nobody can do it but themselves, because I realized that you have to WANT the truth, to SEE the truth. I would like to emphasize with everyone here, I have an insanely strong mind in a spiritual and mental sense. When I was a child, I was tormented by insomnia and \"evil thoughts\" and had terrible thoughts in my head when I would try to go to sleep, and one day I decided the only way I would be happy was to destroy it. So I stopped thinking. After a few weeks, it became natural, and to this day, I still have a clear head, with not a thought going through it. But, through those three weeks? It was the opposite, and I experienced for the entire three weeks the suffering and chaos I had suppressed. And after all of the mental rubble and debris got cleaned up, I came out stronger than ever before.\\n\\nREAD THIS: I thought this important to denote, I was instantly drawn specifically to Shaivism when researching about Hinduism. And looking now on Wikipedia, it seems many of the things and experiences I\\'ve been through aligns perfectly with what Shaivites beleive.

I live in the USA, and I\\'m German, and I know it\\'s probably unheard of someone coming to this path of life, from where I come from, but I would like to move to India and renounce my past life eventually. I want to know what I can do to get started on my journey, because honestly, I\\'m out of clues. I will do research and continue to grow, but advice would be appreciated. You can\\'t exactly google how to move to India and join a group of people (I\\'ll give an example, the Hindu equivalent of becoming a Buddhist monk and devoting himself to his studies, living in a temple) ~ I have done a little bit of research and I know it\\'s possible, so I would like to skip the Second Ashrama and choose the path of becoming a Sannyasa, no matter how long it takes. I know I\\'m 18 years old, but I feel that this is my true calling. And I feel once I reach that point, I can go even further than that. At the moment, I don\\'t know too much about Hinduism in a deep sense, so I\\'m going to do a lot more research, and start living a lifestyle of a Shaivite specifically to prepare myself (as this is the system of beliefs that I align with absolutely 100% without a doubt, and it just feels right to me naturally). But if you guys understand what I desire, and you know anything that can help me on my journey, I would so appreciate any knowledge.\\n\\n2nd question, is it possible that I am a reincarnation of some type of philosopher? The only reason I ask this is because I\\'m drawn very strongly not only to Shaivism, but to the Dharma, to the truths of life, and to the dualities of life. It\\'s like... I\\'m being guided by memories I can\\'t remember, but they\\'re still influencing me and helping me grow, and slowly unlocking more and more of my mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnnd that\\'s it\\nIf you read all of this, thanks a lot. I ask anyone that reads all of this and has knowledge that could help me, to give a response. I also ask that you take your time to write it and really try to help me out. I know, this is all a lot to take in and respond to, but can\\'t you see my passion? It won\\'t be a waste of time putting your heart into a response, because I am devoted now to this.\\n\\nThank you, everyone! \\nSorry for the INSANELY long post, by the way.

Dritharaashtra, I feel, more than the love for his son remained mute because he had essentially no power over his sons. But surely the pitamagan could have stopped this incident and in effect kept the escalation between the cousins in check. Doing so would have meant no war if you think about it. Is there an explanation of this somewhere?\\n\\nAlso shout out to Karna, he has become my favorite character from the epic.', 'There are different interpretations of this. \\n\\nThe interpretation that made most sense to me was that throughout Mahabharata, there is an overbearing theme of people doing silly things for the sake of following through their promises and doing their \"dharma\".

Yudishtira had to stake his wife because it was against the dharma to refuse a game of dice. etc. etc.)\\n\\nKrishna\\'s message and actions point to following the Dharma (ethics) by the spirit and not by the letter. A lot of Krishna\\'s actions are perceived as deception by the other characters in the story, but the reader almost always feels right about Krishna doing them. Even at the end, when Arjuna hesitates to attack the Kauravas because it is against the rules of his Dharma, Krishna encourages him to go forward by making him follow the higher calling. \\n\\nNow, there are a significant number of people who follow different interpretations, and disagree that that was Krishna\\'s message.

So its really the king playing the game.\\nc)Bhishma has technically no role in the court when the game is being played. He's merely an advisor. Intruding into the game overriding the king is technically traitorous.\\nd)Bhishma's role is to provide advise as per his promise to his step mother Satyavathi and to not rule the state. So interfereing directly would indeed be breaking this promise. \\n\\nSo it makes perfect sense for him not to intervene in the political context.\\n\\nHowever, I also refute the idea that his intervening would have brought peace.\\n\\nDuri was drunk with envy.

Which is what they tried, but it failed for the most part.\\n\", \"Bheesma was always trying to be technically correct. For example, he fought for the Kauravas despite knowing that they had Krishna against them, which is a huge red flag for your side. It's not like he was after money or power or driven by his emotions like Duryodhana. But his idea was that he'd follow dharma, and since he was a subject of the king, he'd fight for the king.\\n\\nIf you read that part of the Mahabharata, Bheesma is asked about his opinion on whether Duryodhana broke dharma or not. Bheesma says he cannot reach a conclusion, but the conflict he shows is legal. He is unable to decide if the handing over of Draupadi was legally correct or not. So he took no ethical stand against it and since he couldn't reach a legal opinion, he kept quiet. \\n\\nYou can contrast him with Vidura, who always went by principles, and he protested against Duryodhana's actions.

What was beyond the Vindhyas was defined by Indo European migrations( First by the primary Indo Europeans - Originators of contemporary Hinduism) and later followed by Kushans, Scythians and others. However, One would assume that these movements were of noo consequence to the Southerners for a very long period of time.I would like to discuss about this era.However, after a period of Indo European expansion, Hindi Sanskrit IE influence starting streaming down South, where Southern Chieftans took sides and assistance in a game of one-upmanship.\\n\\nSo, basically we have two Proto Dravidian Kingly lines, possibly from the same families who rule the West(Cheras, now Kerala) and East(Cholas, Chennai, or Tamil Nadu). It is interesting to note that the Cholas took Brahminical help when it came to Metaphysics, especially the Shiva -Vishnu combine(Hari Hara), their Children and extended families for a small example. Its well known that Raja Raja Chola became a Hindu inspired by a Hindu priest( Elite migration into the protected South?) and went on to build huge monuments, usually at the expense of the Tamil locals becoming stone labourers. \\n\\nIts also interesting to note that the Chera Kings  discouraged Hinduism(Swadharma System- propogated in the Gita or Vedic Varnshrama). They had preferred the Assyrians , and Babylonian Traders for Metal Working upgrades and shared Metaphysical Concepts from them.I believe that due to this reason the Hindu epics refer to Kerala Kings as Asuras, who had Shukra(Pleasure instead of Asceticism) for a teacher.\\n\\nThe Cheras(Asuras in another sense) with Kings such as Mahabali, Ravana(Ra- Sun, Vana - Sky - Basically a Title) were defeated(Or Land Restricted) after a long Hindu campaign over thousands of years.This involved military activity(Parashuram), population tactics(Vishnu Vamana as the Dwarf Brahmin), Krishna vs Kamsa(Note Kamsas real father was a Rakshasa), Rama vs Ravana (Whatever might be the reasons).\\n\\nAnd by the end of the campaigns we see that the real Cheras are displaced by the fake Cheras. We can see the second Chera dynasty having Sanskrit names like  Verma, Rama, Ravi instead of the First Chera Malayala names such as Nedum Cheralathan, Uthiyan etc.However they are not finished yet, we see a particular group of socialists in Kerala seize the Central Heartland (they are a mix of native+west semitic, native Assyrian-Babylonian, Native Arab Children) and the new Chera Kings are forced South into Travancore, Feudal Warriors(Native Chekavars)  Seize Northern Kerala and the Hindu Kings(Zamorin) is restricted to the Extreme North.So, we can see that the First Cheras become feudal landlords for a period of time and then later displace the second Cheras and the first Cheras re-emerge  and Brahminism was eventually banned in recent times and Kerala is a communist state till now with Cow Slaughter not only permissible, but encouraged for meat eating practices, usually along with a serving of fresh toddy.

To sum it up it\\'s a long-running jrpg series that is usually set in an apocalyptic setting and revolves around ideological conflict, this includes:\\n\\n1. The law side which fights for order and archives to create a socialist utopia represented by the judeo-christian angels\\n\\n2. It\\'s opposition, the Chaos faction that strives to create a dystopian anarchy so \"only the strong can survive\" and limitless freedom can be accomplished that is represented by the judeo-christian fallen angels/demons\\n\\n3. and the neutral side which denounces both so humanity can follow the best of both sides, which results in it being unstable and suseptable to more ideological wars, and is represented by humans and sometimes even random pagan gods and goddesses.\\n\\nNow, some of you may be familiar to [this little controversy](http://nichegamer.com/2016/02/03/hindus-are-pissed-that-krishna-is-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final/) that happened over a year ago (i\\'m not sure how repeatable the source is, so take it with a grain of salt), which actually inspired me to write this post so i can present what krishna is in-game to those not familiar with it. To begin, i\\'ll just say he\\'s more than just a summonable ally, he plays a major role in the story actually.\\n\\nnow that i\\'ve quickly boiled down the basics of the series, maybe you are wondering what that role in the latest game is. Well, i can\\'t really do this without spoiling the game\\'s plot, but here i go: after he is unsealed he preaches about how yahweh trapped souls into the material realm so they are forced to cling to him via the circle of law-chaos (i could go more into detail, but that\\'d make this post a lot longer than it already is). Krishna\\'s plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy.

I\\'ve been Agnostic/Atheist for the past 20+ years and this is the closest thing I have ever found to believing in a \"god\" so I would love to learn more. Sorry for my ignorance, but do the Hindu\\'s have churches or gathering places? Thanks for any info and I hope the below will help someone like it has helped me. \\n\\nYou can read the book \"On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are\" for free here: http://www.leary.ru/download/watts/Book%20On%20The%20Taboo%20Against%20Knowing%20Who%20You%20Are.pdf\\n\\nAnd here is the quote from the book that I just loved and turned me onto reading more about the Vendata Philosophy. \\n\\n\"There was never a time when the world began, because it goes round and round like a circle, and there is no place on a circle where it begins. Look at my watch, which tells the time; it goes round, and so the world repeats itself again and again. But just as the hour-hand of the watch goes up to twelve and down to six, so, too, there is day and night, waking and sleeping, living and dying, summer and winter. You can\\'t have any one of these without the other, because you wouldn\\'t be able to know what black is unless you had seen it side-by-side with white, or white unless side-by-side with black.\\n\\n\"In the same way, there are times when the world is, and times when it isn\\'t, for if the world went on and on without rest for ever and ever, it would get horribly tired of itself. It comes and it goes. Now you see it; now you don\\'t. So because it doesn\\'t get tired of itself, it always comes back again after it disappears. It\\'s like your breath: it goes in and out, in and out, and if you try to hold it in all the time you feel terrible. It\\'s also like the game of hide-and-seek, because it\\'s always fun to find new ways of hiding, and to seek for someone who doesn\\'t always hide in the same place.\\n\\n\"God also likes to play hide-and-seek, but because there is nothing outside God, he has no one but himself to play with. But he gets over this difficulty by pretending that he is not himself. This is his way of hiding from himself. He pretends that he is you and I and all the people in the world, all the animals, all the plants, all the rocks, and all the stars. In this way he has strange and wonderful adventures, some of which are terrible and frightening. But these are just like bad dreams, for when he wakes up they will disappear.\\n\\n\"Now when God plays hide and pretends that he is you and I, he does it so well that it takes him a long time to remember where and how he hid himself. But that\\'s the whole fun of it—just what he wanted to do. He doesn\\'t want to find himself too quickly, for that would spoil the game. That is why it is so difficult for you and me to find out that we are God in disguise, pretending not to be himself. But when the game has gone on long enough, all of us will wake up, stop pretending, and remember that we are all one single Self—the God who is all that there is and who lives for ever and ever.\\n\\n\"Of course, you must remember that God isn\\'t shaped like a person. People have skins and there is always something outside our skins. If there weren\\'t, we wouldn\\'t know the difference between what is inside and outside our bodies. But God has no skin and no shape because there isn\\'t any outside to him. [With a sufficiently intelligent child, I illustrate this with a Möbius strip—a ring of paper tape twisted once in such a way that it has only one side and one edge.] The inside and the outside of God are the same. And though I have been talking about God as \\'he\\' and not \\'she,\\' God isn\\'t a man or a woman. I didn\\'t say \\'it\\' because we usually say \\'it\\' for things that aren\\'t alive.\\n\\n\"God is the Self of the world, but you can\\'t see God for the same reason that, without a mirror, you can\\'t see your own eyes, and you certainly can\\'t bite your own teeth or look inside your head. Your self is that cleverly hidden because it is God hiding.\\n\\n\"You may ask why God sometimes hides in the form of horrible people, or pretends to be people who suffer great disease and pain. Remember, first, that he isn\\'t really doing this to anyone but himself. Remember, too, that in almost all the stories you enjoy there have to be bad people as well as good people, for the thrill of the tale is to find out how the good people will get the better of the bad. It\\'s the same as when we play cards. At the beginning of the game we shuffle them all into a mess, which is like the bad things in the world, but the point of the game is to put the mess into good order, and the one who does it best is the winner. Then we shuffle the cards once more and play again, and so it goes with the world.\"\\n\\nThis story, obviously mythical in form, is not given as a scientific description of the way things are. Based on the analogies of games and the drama, and using that much worn-out word \"God\" for the Player, the story claims only to be like the way things are. I use it just as astronomers use the image of inflating a black balloon with white spots on it for the galaxies, to explain the expanding universe. But to most children, and many adults, the myth is at once intelligible, simple, and fascinating. By contrast, so many other mythical explanations of the world are crude, tortuous, and unintelligible. But many people think that believing in the unintelligible propositions and symbols of their religions is the test of true faith. \"I believe,\" said Tertullian of Christianity, \"because it is absurd.\"', \"Oh great, Alan Watts. So anyway, I don't know which part of America you're from OP, considering you're asking if Hindus have places of worship. Ever heard of a temple? \\n\\nAnyway, Alan Watts is only good for an introduction, since he mixes and matches stuff which don't mix and match. For example, he downplays the word God, which Hindus won't do. \\n\\nThe school of Vedanta you're referring to is known as Advaita Vedanta, one of three major Vedantic schools. \\n\\nThere is a new site on Advaita Vedanta which is based on the traditional lineage of teaching, you can check it out [here](http://discovervedanta.com/).\", 'I would recommend the works of Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, and Sri Ramana Maharshi if you are interested in learning more about modern Advaita Vedanta.  \\n\\nJai Maa.', \"Since you're american I recommend Dennis waite's books which might be a good introduction to advaita as he is someone who has read and practiced a lot.

Practices are aimed at material well being or of a 'spiritual' nature(more precisely, to free up one's conditioning and to get out of repetitive cycles of behaviour).

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \\n\\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \\n\\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\\n\\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\\n\\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\\n\\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \\n\\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*', 'The Symbolism of Ganesh ChaturthiIt is pitiable to depict Lord Ganapati [Ganesha] with the head of the elephant and offer Him grass and leaves, treating Him as an animal. \\n\\nThe story itself is absurd because is says that Lord Shiva cuts the head of Ganapati. It is said that Lord Shiva was ignorant of Ganapati, who was brought to life as the son of Goddess Parvati. How ignorant is this fabrication! \\n\\nLord Shiva is said to be the deity of Knowledge (Jnanam Maheswaraat). He is Sarvajna or omniscient. Is such a story not insulting to Lord Shiva, who is the ultimate Lord? \\n\\nGanapati means the Lord of the devotees of His innermost circle, who are liberated souls. He is the ultimate Lord who comes down to this earth in human form to play with His devotees here. Ignorance is at its maximum on earth and therefore this world is an excellent playground for His divine play or game. \\n\\nHe comes down along with the devotees belonging to His innermost circle called as Gana (Kridayantam aharnisham—Shankara). This story can be likened to a boy who calls his closest friends to play a game or a person who goes to see and enjoy a cinema along with his family members. \\n\\nThe ultimate Parabrahman, who descends down in the human form along with His innermost devotees, for the divine play on this earth is Ganapati (Gananaantva—Veda). \\n\\nWhat is the meaning of the elephant-head? It means the nature of an elephant.\\n\\nThe head represents the intelligence or Buddhi of an elephant and not the head of the elephant physically. We scold a stupid person and call him a donkey. It means that his inner nature is like that of the donkey and not his physical form.\\n\\nWhat is the nature of an elephant? It is said “Gajaana mati Bhirutvam’, which means that the elephant has enormous strength but it forgets its own strength and is always afraid of everything. Similarly, when the Lord comes down, He imposes ignorance on Himself to enjoy the role. The actor should forget himself in the role if he wants to fully enjoy his character. Therefore, the Lord forgets His divine strength and acts like a Jeeva (soul), fearing the onslaught of troubles in this world.\\n\\nThe Veda says that fear is a characteristic of the limited soul (Atha tasya Bhayam Bhavati). Only by being fearful can the Lord fully enjoy and also do full justice to the role.\\n\\nIt is said that Goddess Parvati prepared the body of Ganapati and also introduced life into it. This statement has an inner spiritual meaning. Goddess Parvati represents Maya. When the Lord incarnates in this world, Maya prepares the human body and also introduces life, which is Para Prakriti, into it.\\n\\nTherefore, life or awareness is only a part of creation and is not Parabrahman. \\n\\nGanapati also shows five faces like Shiva. This indicates that Parabrahman indicated by the word Shiva has entered the human body. Ganapati is said to be the husband of Siddhi and Buddhi. Siddhi and Buddhi are not two ladies although they are symbolically shown to be so. \\n\\nBuddhi means knowledge associated with logical analysis. Siddhi means attainment. You have to attain the Lord in human form, who is the Satguru by logical analysis, so that you can eliminate fraud preachers. Siddhi means the attainment of the Lord in human form.\\n\\nYou should take the inner sense of Lord Ganesha’s story, which alone is the truth.\\n\\nScholars explain the concept in a symbolic language for the sake of illiterate and ignorant people. \\n\\nGanapati is said to be very brave, having stood against even Lord Shiva. This means that when the Lord is with full knowledge in His original form, He is fully aware of His divine strength. But when the head of Ganapati is replaced by the head of an elephant, He forgot all his divine strength and was afraid of everything. \\n\\nThis is a symbolic story. \\n\\nThe actual meaning is that the Lord in his original form is fully aware of Himself and His power. But when he comes down in human form, He forgets His divine strength and fears like an ordinary soul. This gives full enjoyment to the Lord in the human role. \\n\\nThe vehicle of the huge Ganapati is a small rat. This means that when you enter the service of the Lord, you need not think about your capacity to serve Him. By the will and power of the Lord, you’ll gain the capability to serve Him.

Maya in simple terms is defined as space, time and causation. All the objective quantities in the universe which we can perceive through our senses and mind (in the form of thoughts, beliefs, etc) all come under Maya. Within maya, one objective quantity can be simplified and explained in terms of other objective quantity.  In particular, all your questions regarding karma are of this type.\\n\\nBut all of maya is just an appearance of the ultimate truth; Atman(which is very loosely translated as soul, whose meaning varies from context to context), which encompasses all the objective happenings in maya. The Atman is not an object, rather, it is that which illumines every objective experience in maya. Atman is eternal and the only thing that exists, rest everything is non-existing, borrowing existence from it. The scriptures are mainly concerned with this ultimate truth, in pointing out that this divine, pure, eternal truth is you, the Atman; Tat Tvam Asi. What happens within maya really isn\\'t ever really happening or a problem from the viewpoint of Atman. So you may not find detailed descriptions of Karma in the scriptures. In fact, the scriptures say: *There is no dissolution, no birth, none in bondage, none aspiring for wisdom, no seeker of liberation and none liberated. This is the absolute truth. Mandukya Upanishad - 2.32.* (So in particular, there is  no karma as well). \\n\\nBut but but... as long as we haven\\'t discovered the truth for ourselves, this isn\\'t going to be of any use (just look at the amount of suffering present in the world). Karma is just a measure how ones actions bear consequences, ultimately for realizing the truth. Although karma is part of this illusion as well, it is very important to cultivate good karma for spiritual progress. \\n\\nAll your questions are perfectly valid questions within maya, but don\\'t expect to get a complete satisfactory answer for every question in maya xD. There is no perfect answer to these questions until one is enlightened. In fact, after enlightenment this question itself ceases. It is done and dusted. This question was never a problem and will never be. The concept of Maya was never a thing.  There is no reasonable logical answer for a dream within the dream. Only once you get outside the dream do you realise that Oh, it was just a dream. It was all false. Similarly, only once you get enlightened do you realise that Oh, this universe was all false. The dream is an illusion created by your mind in your mind. This universe is an illusion created by Atman in Atman.\\n\\n  \\nThere is indeed a path in our life for becoming enlightened. Accept that the scriptures tell you that that you are Atman. If you answer \"I don\\'t know\" or \"I don\\'t believe you\", this is Maya. To overcome maya, don\\'t try to establish Maya.

The people who use reddit regularly are often those who also enjoy intellectual stimulation. Gyaan yoga is a suitable path for such people. You can read about [Gyaan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga) on the wikipedia page, you can read the Upanishads for yourself, you can also read modern Gurus who have done their best to describe classical Gyaan yoga. However, it none of it *really* has the effect that one wants. Once in a while you can find a description of the Hindu worldview that is not attempting to recreate classical Gyaan yoga and this often resonates with us. \\n\\nI have written [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gyaan-Yoga-Knowledge-Behzad-Nikzad/dp/B09T833WZ8/ref=zg_bsnr_943272_11/000-0000000-0000000?pd_rd_i=B09T833WZ8&psc=1) on this subject. The book I have written did not start out with this title. It was originally going to be called \"So, you want to think eh?\" I didn’t even know that I was writing about Gyaan Yoga. I have read the Upanishads and have always been enamoured with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. However, when I started on my journey to write this book, I was trying to write about critical thinking and the way the quality of our conversations has deteriorated over time. I didn’t have Gyaan yoga in mind at that time. At the suggestion of my partner, I started including analogies between the practice of holding bodily postures ([asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana)) and the practice of thinking. To my great surprise, every analogy worked out beautifully. Slowly, I became convinced that I was not only writing about useful analogies and that instead there was a deep connection between \"yoga poses\" and the subject of my book. Suddenly, it dawned on me that I was rediscovering Gyaan yoga! \\n\\nIt is hard to summarize this wonderful journey that I went through, so instead I will give you a taste of the content of the book and the general themes of it. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about the book.\\n\\n**The Mountain**\\n\\n> We are on the verge of a wonderful evolutionary transformation. Each of us has the potential to become highly individuated. A person is individuated to the degree that they are aware of the feelings elicited within them by the physical and mental postures they hold. Individuated humans have often been likened to flowers; they arouse feelings of delight, bliss and curiosity within us.\\n\\n> A person who wishes to pursue Gyaan yoga is like an explorer in the foothills of a grand mountain. Classical Gyaan yoga offers a view from the summit. Siddhartha\\'s teachings offer us another view from the summit. In this book you will not find a fresh view from the summit, instead you will find a travel-guide that can aid you in the climb. It is okay if certain passages do not elicit clarity of mind within you. Every passage is intended to make you aware of the emotions elicited within you, even if that emotion is irritation, confusion or aggravation. It may seem that the different topics and chapters introduced are not interrelated. The path of knowledge is filled with such intellectual complexity. This is to be expected since the practice of Gyaan yoga is, in essence, a strengthening of intellectual functions. \\n\\n**On Mental Models & Asanas**\\n\\n> A mental model of the world can be held by the human mind. This is analogous to a person holding an asana with their body. We are both able to see the postures we hold with our bodies and sense the feelings elicited in our bodies by the postures. The mental models we hold in our minds can only be sensed by the feelings elicited within us when we hold them. Our minds are always holding a mental model or moving between mental models. This is analogous to our body always holding a posture or moving between postures. The practice of Gyaan yoga is a path in which the novice is trained to hold mental models in their mind in a specific way. At first, even basic mental models are hard to hold, but with time this practice becomes easier. The mental models that the novice is able to hold also become more complex with time. It can be amazing to observe an experienced practitioner holding an extremely complex mental model in their mind. \\n\\n**On Critical Thinking & Pranayama**\\n\\n> We are born with a body similar to how we are born with a mind. Our bodies are always holding a pose similar to how our minds are always holding a mental model. It is unreasonable for us to regularly practice every physical pose someone suggests; similarly, it is unreasonable for us to regularly hold every mental model someone suggests. When we are introduced to a new pose, a reasonable approach is to try to hold the pose cautiously. We can then breathe deeply in the pose and listen to our body. Does it feel good or does it feel painful? Does this pose serve us or does it block us? Is this a stable pose or an unstable pose? Does this pose fit within the general practice that we have developed? If it doesn\\'t fit, is it worthwhile to invest in integrating it into our practice? The same kinds of questions can be asked with regards to new mental models we encounter. In the same way that breathing deeply helps us to listen to our bodies, critical thinking heuristics help us listen to our minds.\\n\\n**On Clarity of Mind**\\n\\n> The practice of Gyaan yoga is concerned with the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can evoke pleasurable feelings without giving us the feeling of clarity of mind. Mental models can also evoke painful feelings if we are not ready to hold them, or if they don\\'t fit well with other mental models which we are already accustomed to holding. An advanced practitioner of Gyaan yoga can hold mental models in the mind and then focus on whether clarity of mind is produced within them. The feeling of clarity of mind is a subtle feeling. This feeling can be easily misjudged if other feelings are also activated within us. A mental model which produces disgust in us may be judged as one that doesn\\'t produce clarity of mind, even if it would at another time when the feeling of disgust is not present. A mental model which produces excitement in us may be judged as one that does produce clarity of mind, even if it would not at another time when the feeling of excitement is not present. The practitioner of Gyaan yoga practices isolating the feeling of clarity of mind. This is the training required to develop a mind which is resilient to being overwhelmed.\\n\\n> The feeling of clarity of mind is felt by the individual. This feeling can only be induced when the practitioner’s mind is relaxed. The feeling of clarity of mind is deepened when critical thinking is applied to a mental model. This means the premise is clear, the conclusions are clear, the conclusions follow from the premises, and no obvious fallacies are found. The feeling of clarity of mind is disturbed if a fallacy appears within the mental model. If a fallacy does appear, the resilient mind may adapt the mental model such that the fallacy disappears. If a suitable adaptation is not found, then the fallacy is accepted as part of the mental model, but this is observed in a very clear way. If the mental model is associated with observations, then the nature and source of those observations is clear for the practitioner who has found clarity of mind. In essence, the practitioner who finds clarity of mind is completely relaxed in holding a particular mental model and would not become imbalanced by simple questions or new observations.\\n\\n**On The Modern School System**\\n\\n> There is an analogous concept for mental models. There is the practice of individuals holding mental models with the aim of individuation; this is Gyaan yoga. Then, there is the collective education of children to hold mental models as a group. How can a group of people collectively hold a mental model if mental models are held within the minds of individuals? This is accomplished in the same way that a squad of soldiers might hold a formation as a group, even though each soldier\\'s posture is held by their individual bodies. With all this in mind, do our educational institutions seem more similar to military training or to the practice of asanas? It seems to me that most schools, including many of those that purport to encourage critical thinking, follow the same heuristics and goals as military training. Some students may have been able to hold mental models, as commanded by teachers, with ease. They may have been able to apply critical thinking to the mental models that they were taught. However, for the vast majority of students, military training is likely a much more apt analogy for our school systems. \\n\\n> Consider the solar system model. Do you hold it as an individual or as part of a collective? Certainly it is being held in the mind of most people who have been through any school system. What exactly is held in most people\\'s minds? The sun is positioned in the center of the system, and the planets rotate around the sun. The sun is a source of light. Some planets have their own moons that rotate around them. The planets and moons have different sizes. The planets are composed of different materials. One planet has rings. Some planets spin around themselves. How many people were encouraged to apply critical thinking to this mental model? How many people were coerced into rote memorization of these facts in order to pass tests? Does this teaching pedagogy more resemble military training, or the practice of asanas? \\n\\n> Over the past few years, I have had a variation of the following conversation with hundreds of people:\\n\\n> \"What is bigger, the sun or the moon?\" \\n\\n> \"The sun,\" they reply, after a small hesitation. They seem to wonder why they are being tested.\\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is bigger?\"\\n\\n> \"Because the sun is further away. That is why it appears to be the same size as the moon,\" they reply, a little unsure of themselves after some thought. \\n\\n> \"How do you know the sun is further away?\"\\n\\n> \"Light takes a long time to come from the sun to the Earth,\" or \"the Earth orbits the sun.\" \\n\\n> \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n> \"Well, I don\\'t. I read about it somewhere\", they say to me with some indignation. \\n\\n> I find this extremely tragic. The solar system model is one that was developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga. It is meant to be a mental model that guides the process of individuation. It is amenable to critical thinking, if the practitioner is advanced in their practice of Gyaan yoga. This wondrous mental model was developed so that it would evoke clarity of mind for those who hold it. Yet, it rarely evokes clarity of mind for those who hold it now. The mental models developed in the tradition of Gyaan yoga now routinely evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment and indignation in those who hold them. We find it hard to say \"I don\\'t know. To be honest, I have never been interested in holding this mental model and I am not interested now\". \\n\\n**On Consciousness**\\n\\n> One analogy [for consciousness] that I have found particularly potent is that of water in a whirlpool. The water flows down a stream, collects and circles in a whirlpool for a while, and then moves on again down the stream. The whirlpool represents our individual self that we identify with and the water represents our consciousness. While the water is in the whirlpool, it may come to identify itself as a whirlpool. Whirlpools are ephemeral, and the water which flows through them is always changing. Therefore, a whirlpool does not have a static identity either, but we seem to assign it one. Similarly, our bodies and minds are never static and consciousness flows through them continuously. Nevertheless, we tend to identify ourselves with our bodies and minds. It tickles my mind to wonder “why do whirlpools have water flowing through them?”\\n\\n> There is a pattern that has recurred in my life many times. It is very likely you have experienced it too. I remember a few incidents when I got into a conflict or debate with someone and tried to find a resolution. In each of these cases, I was arguing over the difference between the mental models that we each held. In some of those cases, the argument would be about a mental model that I had been conditioned to hold, especially one that I have held since I was very young. In other cases, the argument was about a mental model that I have adopted consciously (e.g. a mental model that I adopted after someone introduced it to me through a conversation). I found that gaps in my consciousness became more frequent and lasted longer when I debated mental models that I had been *conditioned* to hold. In these debates, the presence of painful feelings I was conditioned to experience overwhelmed my consciousness.\\n\\n> We may now return to our question about *what* is consciousness? It seems reasonable to conclude that consciousness is awareness of our feelings, and that awareness is interrupted by *conditioned* responses. The Rishis called the conditioned responses of the mind ‘Chitti Vritti’. The purpose of Gyaan yoga is to promote the dissolution of Chitti Vritti, and therefore to reduce gaps in our consciousness. We can also conceptualize ‘Chitti Vritti’ as mental models that we evaluate without checking in with our Self. For example, we may convince ourselves that we feel clarity when we say “the sun is bigger than the moon”. In that case, we have convinced ourselves that we must be loyal to the solar system model. We forgo our miraculous experience of consciousness in order to avoid recognizing that such a mental model does not elicit clarity within us. How do you feel when you say “I don\\'t know if the sun is bigger than the moon”? I feel a little awkward when I say that, but I prefer to feel that awkwardness than to deny my connection with my Self.\\n\\n**Pragyaanam Brahama**\\n\\n> Why is it that becoming aware of the feeling of clarity of mind has such powerful consequences? There are three observations that we can readily make about the feeling of clarity and the fruits of its traditions. First, it is interesting that the feeling of clarity of mind has a form of universality amongst members of our species. Suppose one person is able to hold a mental model in such a way that it elicits clarity of mind. Why then is it so common that others can also feel clarity of mind when holding the same mental model? It is normal for humans to have different feelings when holding the same mental model. It is not evident a-priori that a specific feeling will be felt universally and regularly by those who partake in a specific tradition. Consider the mathematics that we have developed. Isn\\'t it amazing that the same set of mental models has elicited precisely the same feeling of clarity of the mind for mathematicians for thousands of years? Second, the feeling of clarity of mind has a physical analogue in calculators and computers. The mental models and processing that we can do with our minds can also be done by computers that we design. Computers have confirmed every mathematical theorem that we have tested within their circuitry. Third, the success of the guild of scientists in preserving and destroying life has been completely unparalleled by any other tradition that we have developed in the past. Why does the feeling of clarity relate mental models, minds and matter in such a regular way? \\n\\n> There is an analogy that can help us to explain all three phenomena simultaneously. Modern artificial algorithms (AI) can perform incredible feats. They can recognize faces, paint in the style of famous artists, and compete against humans in games. We feed data into these algorithms and they build representations of the universe from which the data originates. They use these representations to then perform tasks. The first achievement of AI that astounded humanity were chess playing engines that could defeat humans. Chess playing algorithms determine optimal next moves when given the positions of the pieces on the board. Fully self-driving cars still seem to be out of reach and an aspiration for AI. This is a little puzzling. A human can learn to drive a car much more easily than they can play chess at a grandmaster level, let alone handily defeat every other human. Why is it that it is easier for a human to learn to drive than to master chess? And why is the opposite true for AI? The game of chess can be easily encoded into the circuitry of a computer. In contrast, the complexity of our physical universe is far from being simulated easily by computers, as is necessary to develop self-driving cars. We can build AI that can play almost any video game that we have ever designed. AI can play the game by receiving the same feedback a human would on a display monitor. The *nature* of the game is such that it can be encoded into the computer\\'s circuitry. This in turn means that a representation of the game can be easily found with AI, since that AI is encoded on the same type of circuitry. \\n\\n> Suppose our experience of the physical world is a projection of a reality encoded upon some medium. We can only observe the projection (display) with our senses, not the reality (software) nor the medium (circuitry). Suppose that our minds (AI) are encoded upon the same medium. Suppose also that the feeling of clarity of mind (logic) was a special property of this medium. Then, it would be reasonable that our minds (AI) could easily model the reality (software) that is the source of our observations. This is precisely the view the Rishis expressed. They summarized this as “Pragyaanam Brahma”. This means, “Absolute clarity is Brahman”. In other words, the conscious experience of absolute clarity is the essence which pervades the universe and is its cause. It is important to note that this analogy is meant to serve as a marker on the path to individuation. It is a posture that you can hold with your mind. You can then become aware of your feelings as you hold this mental model in your mind. All the analogies in this book serve to help you identify and focus on the feelings elicited by your mind. This is their singular purpose.', 'Nice write up, I have a question. I get the sense that Bhakti yoga essentially tells you to accept and surrender. The act of surrendering and not having to worry and letting go gives one a certain bliss. Many religions not just hinduism follow essentially the path of surrender. \\n\\nwhile in Jnana yoga, one ponders and thinks and tries different things until they get the essence of it. Once the yogi simply \"gets it\"he has this realisation and a certain bliss related to it. \\n\\nA lot of thinkers in known history are unwittingly jnana yogis. Many of them go this way because, they cannot just simply accept what someone tells them, they need to see it, feel it, make it, experience it and realise and understand it themselves.

What does reconciliation of these two really mean, does it mean you give up on one of the paths ?

I didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life, everything seemed pointless. I was struggling with my addictions and negative habits (video games, masturbation, procrastination, laziness, etc.).

I am happy, therefore I want to share this opportunity with others.\\n\\nBrahmacharya is a life of a monk, it\\'s a commitment to restrict oneself from sense gratification, and focus on your spiritual growth. Following vows of celibacy, even for a short time, provides great benefit. Brahmacharya is a stage of life in which men learn responsibility, discipline, and balance. Brahmacharya is one of the pillars of Vedic society. It is a crucial stage of life. It allows young men to curb their bad tendencies, get rid of addictions and learn discipline and self-control. All of these things are necessary to live a happy, meaningful life. Discipline gives freedom. Without discipline, one cannot attain his desired goals, whether they are spiritual or material.\\n\\nDiscipline allows you to focus on the things that matter in your life and avoid things that are simply in the way between you and your goal. Intoxication, porn, masturbation, addictions, video games, negative habits, laziness, procrastination–all these things steal a lot of our vital energy. If we cannot focus, if we cannot control ourselves, we become weak and meek. We will never achieve our goals if we don\\'t develop the necessary skills.\\n\\nThis brahmacharya stage of life is the training process. Without proper training, one cannot become a successful athlete, actor, businessman, lawyer, etc. Bruce Wayne underwent intense training before he became Batman. Thomas A. Anderson (from the movie \"Matrix) had to train with Morpheus until he became Neo or \"The One\". In the same way, even in our world, without the proper training one cannot become a good man, a good husband, or a good father. First, we must focus on ourselves, and help ourselves, then we can help others. What will happen to a man who does not know how to swim if he tries to rescue a drowning person? He will drown.\\n\\nBrahmacharya life is the life of a student; a life of dedication and constant learning. It\\'s an opportunity to tap into your potential and become a better person, the best version of yourself. After this training process (which could last from a few months to a few years) one has to choose what he wants in his life. There are two options: the path of a monk and the path of family life. Both are very important for a healthy, sustainable society. Both require a lot of dedication, focus, and patience. This is why the training process is so important.\\n\\nWe have a wonderful sixty-acre facility that is split into two parts by an elegant creek.

For a time we identify with the roles being played as real characters (when in reality they are just actors).\\n\\nAren't we into the role of our self (lower-case 's') right now and can't we enjoy expansion of that self in love and being free?\", 'Much of this confusion is due to promiscuous usage of language. Once you  use clear language, much of the confusion vanishes. \\n\\nIn AV, it\\'s important in bear in mind that there are two levels of reality - the absolute and the phenomenal (there\\'s a third but that one involves experiences that can be proven illusory even in the phenomenal standpoint. The Absolute is Brahman - Existence, Awareness and Bliss (calm). It is attributeless and unchanging. Nothing can be predicated of it.  The Phenomenal is the World - diverse and changing. That\\'s the reality in which you, I and everything else exists. They don\\'t have independent existence but rather their existence is superimposed on Brahman due to avidya. This avidya can\\'t be described as real or unreal - it\\'s something else. \\n\\nThe dream analogy or the simulation analogy can\\'t be taken literally but only in a limited extent. In our dream state, the objects are unreal but the experience is real i.e. the fear or joy is real. We have some limited memory of our dreams, especially the more vivid ones, which shows that the experience in the dream left a real impression on the mind.  If you apply this to Brahman as dreamer or Brahman as some game-player, then Brahman would have to experience the world, and since the world involves change, then the experience would change with it which implies Brahman changes which is explicitly denied in AV. A better analogy for AV is the classic snake-rope analogy where an non-existent snake is superimposed on a real rope and forms the basis of fear etc.\\n\\nNow back to the nihilism issue. From the Absolute standpoint, it does sound nihilistic. In fact, that\\'s the main charge of the critics who accuse Advaitins of being Sunyavada Buddhists in Vedic garb. As Ramanuja states \"no sensible person exerts himself under the influence of the idea that after he himself has perished there will remain some entity called pure light\"\\n\\nHowever, this is only from an Absolute stand-point. Till we attain moksha which is the same as realizing that we are eternally Brahman, the normal rules of morality, human ends, meaning etc all apply. \\n\\nTo give an example, we all know that the world is made of fundamental particles of various kinds. However, no-one, even physicists, experiences the world like that. Knowing, understanding and realizing are very different concepts.', \"If we're defining nihilism as an intrinsic lack of meaning then you may be onto something, however not all things need meaning or purpose to be wonderful.\\n\\nTake music, does music have a goal or a purpose, not really. Think about it, when you play a song do you play the song to complete the song, no, you play it for enjoyment. \\n\\nDoes dancing have a purpose, not really. We dance for the sake of dancing itself. Does the salsa have a purpose, no, but that doesn't make it ugly or depressive, the opposite is true. \\n\\nSimilarly the world can be seen like this in Advaita, the world isn't real, only an appearance but that's not a bad thing. It doesn't have a purpose or meaning and that's ok, just enjoy it for the dance it is. You can also add meaning to the dance if you'd like which would make Advaita not nihilistic anymore. To use your example of dreams, dreams are not real in the fact that the whole dream landscape is nothing but the dreamer, but this does not make dreams any less wonderful, valuable or enriching. So life is the dream of Brahman, or a play or dance or movie or a video game however you want to approach it.\\n\\nAlso, you and I are real, but only as Brahman, the body and mind are not 'real' in the sense that it's just another expression of Brahman. But the real self not being the body or mind is hinduism 101 and found in many other schools of hinduism, I don't see what the issue is with that. \\n\\nIn my own personal hinduism (I'm non-dual but not strict Advaita) I see the world as a dream and in my experience it makes life wonderful. The beauty and suffering in this world is magestic for me and the reason why I can appreciate the negative is because of seeing the world as a dream. It allows me to take the world less seriously which helps reduce the suffering of attachment to worldy things but at the same time it doesn't make me numb or apathetic to the sufferings of the world. I also was an atheistic nihilist/absurdist when I was younger and I can't see any nihilist tendencies in Advaita. I have never had a desire and purpose as strong as my desire to attain spirtual growth, this is the main driving force of my life. \\n\\nIn regards to there not being any reason to do anything, I'd strongly disagree. Imagine the world as a movie with Bhraman as the director, we all have our  part to play and that is our Dharma and by following Dharma we can find freedom, peace and happiness, so there is a significant push to follow ones duties in Advaita. If we were not to follow Dharma and try to excel in our lifes then the opposite would happen. You may be confusing Advaita with Neo-Advatia which has some extremely lazy tendencies. \\n\\nSome other things. \\n\\nIf you see nihilism as a naturally depressive philosophy then it is the direct opposite of Advaita, in Advaita we discover that our true self is in constant bliss and that we can be in this unchanging ever new bliss for all of eternity. Surely that the opposite of terrifying? \\n\\nPSA: I'm not an expert on Advaita, if you want some more accurate info check this Swami out https://youtu.be/CoF0pOcKOCc\", 'Because advaita vedanta is taught at different levels for different people who are at different spiritual levels. All this everything is me etc is just a vessel to carry you to the truth and the vessel has to be abandoned one day, too. Like a boat, incredibly useful - to the other side of the river, then you abandon it and walk.\\n\\nWe use a thorn analogy, we use a thorn (advaita vedanta) to remove another thorn (human suffering) and then we discard both.\\n\\nAll this I am consciousness and everyone is me, etc etc will be refined and transformed. There is no I, consciousness is not an I. The I is the ego it\\'s ahaṃkara and consciousness is something completely different. The fact you can see the object of I-ness is proof it is not pure consciousness.\\n\\nReality is nondual, it\\'s not perceivable unless you\\'re using a mind to have transactions but the mind will limit you to a perspective of reality that is from the point of view of the mind. Ultimate reality is inconceivable, its infinite and thoughts are finite. We just can\\'t reduce the infinite nondual reality to a thought, it\\'s not possible.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t nothingness though, nor is it something. Not something but also not nothing. This disqualifies it\\'s classification of being nihilistic. Since nihilism has a \"no point\" sort of feel, and in Vedanta we believe existence is the point. Vedanta adds meaning to life, it doesn\\'t remove it.', 'What you said isn\\'t true for just Advaita Vedanta, it is true for all of Vedanta. The point that \"whatever I do is a barrier for moksha\". While it is true that the perception of \"being the only conscious being\" is not exactly the best way to word Advaita, still what you said is shared by all schools of Vedanta. \\n\\nI was going to give you a detailed answer backed up from Bhagavad Gita. But, Vashishta Muni already has answered this question when teaching Bhagavan Sri Rama. Hence it seems best that he should answer your doubt as well directly. \\n\\n[Refutation of Fatalism - Yoga Vashishta](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/yoga-vasistha-english/d/doc118039.html)\\n\\nYou can read the preceding 5 chapters to get an understanding of the basis for it if you wish. This would have the answer though. \\n\\n\\n\\nJai Sita Rama', 'Knowing that this is maya or imagined reality through anubhava is only one half of awakening. The other half is the remembrance of who you are.', 'It\\'s a beautiful question, the questioner\\'s mind has popped out of the closed box mindset, it lets me guess. Because if the question was asking for parallels between Buddhism(shoonyavad) and nihilism it would just be an ordinary philosophy class question.\\nBut the fact that the two, Advaita Vedanta and Nihilism might have some parallel, even such confusion is an insight.\\nAnd I would like to consider them one by one, so to start with Advaita Vedanta, I would like to quote a phrase from Adi Shankaracharya, \\n\"Brahman Satya Jagat Mithya, Jeevo Brahmaiv Na Parah.\"\\nThis translates to Brahman alone is real, the universe(or world) is unreal, and the individual self is no other than Brahman itself(the supreme self).\\nFor nihilism, I would like to define it as the following \"extreme scepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real existence.\"\\nSo the common thing between them is the negative value ascribed to the existence. \\nBut nihilism only ends there and has no other conclusion to draw from this fact.\\nWhile Advaita Vedanta, though says the world is unreal, but it has a conclusion, or an assertion to make regarding the reality of the individual. So there are not same.\\nThe individual inhabiting the universe has a real existence, be the universe unreal. And the fact that the individual is Brahman itself, is a clue to make you consider something being peculiar about the self.', 'I am quite new to the actual teaching of Advaita Vedanta, but I will share what I understood.\\n\\nNihilism (google)- \"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.\"\\n\\nWe will ignore the last line and consider only the first 2 sentences, since it gives a negative connotation to our objective, fact-based and rational discussion.\\n\\nWhat Advaita tells, as you have summarised in simple and near-enough terms- \"We are in a dream of Prabrahma (Brahman) or Maha Vishnu, popularly associated with the ISKCON image of Vishnu sleeping with planets or the one where Vishnu dreams about the worlds.\\n\\nNow, in this basic visualisation, the common thing we see with nihilistic beliefs is that everything activity, everything we see, do and believe, our cultures, values, feelings are baseless (with a negative innotation, imagining the Matrix series). I find that there is nothing wrong in this. Whatever we see, feel and sense, the 24 parts considered Prakriti (5 sense objects, 10 senses and action organs, 5 elements, ego, mind, intellect and the Prakriti which binds everything together), is Maya created by Brahman. Brahman himself manifests as the Atman or Purusha in this Maya. We are a minuscle, minuscle droplet in the mighty ocean considered Brahman, and this tiny representation with the powers of God\\'s Maya make us feel as if we are separate or worse superior beings. This is ego, made possible by mind and the senses, powered by intellect. \\n\\nThere are two ways I can describe our situation-\\n\\nA. Video game  \\nB. Dream\\n\\nIn all this \\'video game\\' we are a part of, we often forget ourselves, playing hours and hours (lives), initially remembering ourselves, but just for fun. Soon we forget time and ourselves, and get stuck in the screen, much like a drug addict. Our atman (your tiny voice of consciousness) tries to wean towards spiritualism, away from the sense organs, this Maya, Matrix or hologram, but we ignore it. We are faced with levels, meet characters and attain gold points. Either we win or lose, we restart the game again. As it is predestined (gameplay story), we may get a spark of light and our heart will go towards the way of being enlightened. We come out of the game, realise the reality (Brahman) and that there is nothing else, no worries, no thoughts, no feelings, no one, only the Brahman.  \\n\\n\\nImagine you are dreaming, you are running on the road, while another person is crazuily running behind you and wields Bahubali level knives. He stabs you in the chest and you see that another person was watching impassively neither helping you nor the other guy. Now you wake up. Can you tell me who are you in this dream, the one killed or the one killing? Are you that heartless bystander who just stood there? Or are you no one of them, seeing the dream as if in a movie or like the Pensieve in HP? If you were the one being killed, then where did the other guys come from? Didn\\'t you dream the other characters, the knife and the road? Were they not created by you in your mind? When you were in the perspective of the killed character, why couldn\\'t you remember or think that you were the other guy too? Would the other guy killing feel the person being killed being the same mind? Finally, what did it matter? Was it useful, did it lead to some result? No, it was just a dream or Leela of Bhagawan. You and the countless others before you and after you are the same, parts of dream of Vishnu. Now, you might think, why should I suffer for his Leela? He ain\\'t paying my emi nor helping me deal with office politics. But remember, in your dreams of fear and pleasure, everything was in your head, you imagined juvenile things with your latest crush or saving the world with iron man. They are not true, but your perspective in dream know it. The ego won\\'t allow that. And that leads to all the \"suffering\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>It also terrifies me to think that under all the layers of personality I think of as \"me\", there is really just a single consciousness, the same in everyone. \\n\\nWhy would \"you\" feel terrified when \"you\" in your thoughts and feelings, insecurities and securities, the physical and mental manifestation is but a dream?

Mackies \"Problem of Evil\" is one of the most well known arguments in religious discourse. Oftentimes you hear people make variations of his argument when they ask common questions like \"Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people\", \"if God is real then why is there so much evil in the world\", etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think in academia, Eastern schools of thought are often forgotten and not considered. As someone who is an eastern ethuisiest and engages in a lot of research on a wide variety of topics relating to eastern beliefs, I think its a shame that so many vibrant and unique perspectives are unknown, and this is why I think it\\'s a worthwhile cause for us to engage in dialogue with westerners, especially atheists, and expose them to a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn this post I will explain the Problem of evil, and state 3 of the eastern defenses that I have found. I would love it if everyone could contribute to this discussion and correct me or add to my list. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**The Problem of Evil explained:**\\n\\nJ. L. Mackie made a deductive argument from evil against the existence of God that uses the following premises: \\n\\n1. God is omnipotent (all powerful) \\n2. God is omniscient (all knowing)\\n3. God is omnibenevolent (all loving/good) \\n\\nGiven the existence of evil in the world, and the fact that a truly omnibenevolent being would want to eliminate as much evil as possible, and in this case has the ability to do so since it is also omnipotent, we can conclude that at least one of these three premises is not true, as they would be contradictory. \\n\\n\\nAn example of this problem would be an analogy of a child who has a terminal disease, and the mother, who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, allows the child to remain sick and suffer. \\n\\n\\n**Eastern Responses** \\n\\n\\nHere is a collection of the 3 main responses I have seen the \"East\" make to the Problem of Evil: \\n\\n\\n\\n**1. Karma**\\n\\n\\nThe word \"karma\" is derived from the sanskrit *karman*, meaning \"act\". The theory of Karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, whereby the intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also further contributes to the law of Karma. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Reincarnation (Augmented Soul Maker)**\\n\\n\\nThe \"soulmaker\" theodicy tries to justify the existence of evil in the context of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God by suggesting that as in individual endures and overcomes evil, they build character and become stronger and more attuned for God\\'s vision of them.  An analogy would be like going to the gym and working out in order to build muscle. In the gym one endures pain and stress, but it is justified as the end result will lead to a healthier body, compared to the alternative of not working out. \\n\\n\\n\\nA common objection to the soulmaker theory is pointing out unnecessary and pointless suffering that does not contribute to building moral character. An analogy would be of a child dying of cancer: what lesson has this innocent child learned, and how has it improved its character? \\n\\n\\n\\nReincarnation is the idea that an aspect of an in individual, whether it be consciousness, mind, sould, or something else, continues to exist after the death of the body, and can again take birth. \\n\\n\\nThe theory of reincarnation can augment the soul making theodicy as it covers one of the most vital weaknesses of it: suffering without a chance for improvement. The reincarnation theory gives individuals many, possibly countless, chances in order to overcome hardships and build their character. It is similar to how in a video game if you die you get to restart, and can have another shot at the level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Evil as an Illusion**\\n\\n\\nOne of the fundamental linchpins that Mackie\\'s Problem of Evil hangs on is the idea the assumption that evil exists. However, as per many Eastern schools of though, the concept of \"evil\" is not even real, and thus the problem of evil is an invalid argument. \\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nPlease leave your responses down below, I would love to read what you have to say. Feel free to correct me or add any new eastern perspectives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: If anyone has a PDF version of the book \"Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought\", then PLEASE SEND IT TO ME ASAP', 'Agreed. Just to add - sometimes individual spirits knowing that they have a huge backlog of karma to exhaust before they get a chance to be liberated or attain higher realms(like Swarga or Vaikuntha or ShivLoka etc) take up more suffering on their earthly life, more than they would have otherwise received by cosmic processes. This then to us regular ppl appears as someone having a really really sh\\\\*tty life full of misery, suffering, etc. SO Karma indeed is the answer but there are nuances within that as well.', \"4. The creature experiencing the evil is an incarnation of God, taking on the pain for some reason that will be known later.\\n\\nExample: the Ramayana\\n\\nAlso, I don't really consider 2 or 3 to be reasons for evil to exist. They are just incidental side effects of 1: Karma.\", \"I would argue that a omnibenevelant God would do bad in the interest of good by helping us grow through suffering. As demonstrated by yin and yan, there is good in bad and bad in good. So I would extend your reincarnation point to growth within a single life, as well as over multiple life times.\\n\\nThe point of good and evil being illusionary is interesting. I understand its called illusionary as we as humans conceptualise everything and as we do our definitions are out of touch with the way things are, it's not actually saying that these things don't exist. This teaching is only calling for a deeper understanding into reality, such as, can evil be classed as inheriently bad if its nessesary for good to exist?\", \"I've never heard of this 'well known' argument.

This might be a tad bit tricky to understand.\\n\\nI’ll first start with what I mean by the **crisis of solipsism**. Have you ever wondered and fashioned yourself as the ‘perceiver’ of this world and everything else is just something you ‘perceive’?\\n\\nYour *‘self’* is that which you call as *‘I’*. It is the mode through which you experience the world, your thoughts and emotions.\\n\\nNow, can you in any certain terms say the world around you is in anyway *real*? What makes you think that you are not made to experience some real-time simulation game that only *feels* real? That all the rest of humans are programmed meat-robots? That all the animals, plants and objects are just programmed to play their respective roles?\\n\\nBut you, that is your *‘self’*, the one who *perceives* (or your *consciousness* - that thing which experiences your thoughts, emotions and inputs through your senses). That *‘self’* is the **only** thing that’s *real*.\\n\\nThis is what I call the **crisis of solipsism**. Solipsism means that you hold that the *‘self’* is the only thing that’s knowable or real.\\n\\nIt’s hard to see a way out once you realize that. Where do *personal ethics* come into play? Don’t you have the freedom to do anything since *‘you’* are just the main playable character in some impeccably designed video game?\\n\\nBut there’s a resolution to that. It’s nothing new. It’s been parroted for millenia by various thinkers and sages.\\n\\nIt’s to hypothesize and extend your consciousness to the whole universe. You say that all of the material world is a manifestation of that consciousness or fundamental reality. To realize that the ‘self’ that is you, is the same as the ‘self’ of anyone else, and of all creation. To dissolve all notions of separation between the *perceiver* (me) and *perceived* (anything).\\n\\n*‘That’* is the fundamental reality, the ultimate principle which is timeless, formless and eternal - is represented as ‘Brahman’ in Advaita philosophy. *‘That’* is also your *‘self’* and everyone else’s *‘self’* and all of creation’s *‘self’*. Which is why Hindus say ‘god’ is everywhere.\\n\\nAll religions have been influential because all of them have some or the other representation of this powerful idea. What is expressed as ‘God’, ‘Allah’ etc. is just a partial representation of ‘that’.\\n\\nOnce you realize the nature of fundamental reality through this lens, you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ~~‘you’ stay in this material world and~~ you utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' or describe the undivided Brahman. That is because simply by the act of thinking of a form or name, you are performing the act of *perceiving* something, which automatically separates you from the object or form that is *perceived*. Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality. Of course, the brahman is the undivided reality, and even the 'perceiver' is manifestation of it, but this is about how you are practicing/preaching it. ~~There are some methods through which you can only tangentially approach that realization.~~ It is beyond the speech or intellect, which can only touch it tangentially, and is something, I guess, to be experienced.\\n\", \"A single atman, and the whole universe being conscious isn't the teaching of Advaita(single atman, and no real universe). It is more like Kashmir Shaivism and other similar traditions.\", \"Advaita Vedanta is a beautifully rich tradition, but I fear it often becomes the most popular choice for people (often westerners) who are simply shopping around for interesting philosophies. \\n\\nRemember to ground your understanding in some sort of real practice or Sadhana, otherwise it's just intellectual gymnastics. \", '[deleted]', \">you’ll also realize that you can never be a true follower/practitioner of Advaita philosophy as long as ‘you’ stay in this material world and utilize speech and thought to 'perceive' (the impeccably designed video game).

Which is against the hypothesis of non-duality\\n\\nSo literally doing anything at all goes against non-duality? In which case, Shankara who wrote volumes of literature and spent his entire life debating people would also be pretty non-advaitic. You sound like some edgy nihilist who just discovered buddhism.\\n\\n\\nThe brahman maybe formless but it's not some dead and static inertia where literally nothing happens. In kashmiri shaivism, the idea of constant internal movement - spanda - is the defining characteristic of the highest non-dual reality, as it is of the grossest reality.\", 'Jcink Roleplay - Hinduism ElementsIf you don\\'t know - a roleplay on a message board (like Jcink or Proboards) is essentially writing parts of a story with friends online (you write part of it, then a friend will respond and write the next part, and it goes from there, piece by piece). \\n\\nPantheons (Greek/Roman, Norse, just to name a few) are a fun subject to explore with this type of collaborative writing setting.\\n\\n**I had a friend that wanted to make a roleplay but involve the Hindu pantheon in some shape or form (modern day gods on earth, children of the gods, mortals blessed with the god\\'s powers through blessed items, etc.). Besides doing the proper research on who the deities are and the like - what would be the \"safest\" setting for this type of plot that involved the pantheon?** \\n\\nI\\'ve seen people who practice Hinduism be sensitive to the idea of people portraying their pantheon in any kind of written media or say video game media and she wants to make sure she isn\\'t accidentally stepping on the wrong toes with this.\\n\\nShe practices Hinduism herself (not since birth, she stepped away from another religion and has seen herself as a Hindu for only about 2-3 years at this point) so she knows the \"core beliefs\" of Hinduism and the like (but again, this story/plotline would revolve around the Hindu gods). Her train of thought is \"If all these different pantheon have so much attention like Egypt and Norse, why can\\'t Hindu pantheon get some attention/love\"?

Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\n--------\\n\\nThis is a tough question to answer.  The only way I can explain it requires a bit of a philosophical paradigm shift, which is to say I embrace a somewhat Yoga-esque, \"endeavor to enjoy experience without the desire for result\" standpoint.  But that\\'s not an easy answer to accept.\\n\\nI\\'m still researching Dzogchen Buddhism, which seems to closely align with this idea of a dream-like \"un-reality,\" but I\\'m not having much luck so far.\\n\\n---------\\n\\nSo my question (at long last) is this: how can I best explain to someone that an illusory reality, a \"lie,\" is worth taking seriously?  What is the \"point\" of doing anything if reality is really just a dream?', '> \"What is the point,\" they ask, \"if everything is just a dream? Why does anything my character does in the game matter, if it\\'s all just an illusion?\"\\n\\nIt makes me wonder:\\n\\nWhat does one gain if it is not a dream, if it is not an illusion? If something is \"just\" a dream, this implies that there is some sort of reality to which \"just\" cannot be applied. What is that? When you scrape this real world, what comes off in your hand? It\\'s more than experiences, so what is it? What is left over that makes this real world more real than the illusory world?\\n\\nIf the problem with the illusory world is that it doesn\\'t have a point, the real one must. What is that, and how does it differ from a set of experiences?', \"One answer is that it will still feel real to you.

', 'your thoughts on the portrayal of Krishna in Shin Megami Tensei IV: ApocalypseI presume most of you aren\\'t familiar with the video game series: shin megami tensei (smt for short). To sum it up it\\'s a long-running jrpg series that is usually set in an apocalyptic setting and revolves around ideological conflict, this includes:\\n\\n1. The law side which fights for order and archives to create a socialist utopia represented by the judeo-christian angels\\n\\n2. It\\'s opposition, the Chaos faction that strives to create a dystopian anarchy so \"only the strong can survive\" and limitless freedom can be accomplished that is represented by the judeo-christian fallen angels/demons\\n\\n3. and the neutral side which denounces both so humanity can follow the best of both sides, which results in it being unstable and suseptable to more ideological wars, and is represented by humans and sometimes even random pagan gods and goddesses.\\n\\nNow, some of you may be familiar to [this little controversy](http://nichegamer.com/2016/02/03/hindus-are-pissed-that-krishna-is-in-shin-megami-tensei-iv-final/) that happened over a year ago (i\\'m not sure how repeatable the source is, so take it with a grain of salt), which actually inspired me to write this post so i can present what krishna is in-game to those not familiar with it. To begin, i\\'ll just say he\\'s more than just a summonable ally, he plays a major role in the story actually.\\n\\nnow that i\\'ve quickly boiled down the basics of the series, maybe you are wondering what that role in the latest game is. Well, i can\\'t really do this without spoiling the game\\'s plot, but here i go: after he is unsealed he preaches about how yahweh trapped souls into the material realm so they are forced to cling to him via the circle of law-chaos (i could go more into detail, but that\\'d make this post a lot longer than it already is). Krishna\\'s plan is for all humans to be eaten by Ananta Shesha so that after 8 days Shesha can turn into the cosmic egg, and transport all the souls it collected to a new universe after Krishna defeats yhvh. In the new universe the creation will start a new and the great singularity will be formed (the game/Krishna doesn\\'t exactly describe what the great singularity is, so it\\'s left up to interpretation i suppose)\\n\\nmoving on to another thing, smt most of the time treats every side as good and bad; and thus you can pick any side that seems like the best to you to get an ending that works out for the side you choose. Even though yahweh is presented as a massive jerk, you can still pick the law or chaos routes (which are intentionally presented as worse than usual mind you) if you\\'re a big fan of the guy. But no such luck with Krishna, he\\'s simply a forced antagonist who you can\\'t side with.\\n\\nand the last thing i will talk about, the character design: now, [his regular form](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/8/8d/SMT_IV_FINAL_Krishna.png/revision/latest?cb=20151025173647) is a pretty good design personally, and along with being very expressive it does a good job conveying his charming, calm but also snarky and sometimes sarcastic. i\\'m not sure whether i\\'d say \"that\\'s Krishna\" the first time i saw his design, but he definitely feels like krishna when i look at him (at least to me)\\n\\nBut his [vishnu](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_B_SMT4A.jpg) [designs](http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vishnuflynn_II_SMTIVA_Official_Art.jpg) seem to go more with the forced antagonist role he plays in the story; maybe the design is referencing something i don\\'t know, but with the \"nandakas\" in the second form that really look more like lightsabers, i can\\'t help but to look at vishnu and think \"what is he, a sith lord?\" Kinda discredits him as a god of preservation when his design seems to just say *evil*\\n\\nSo that about wraps it up, but as a note i should say that my goal is not to upset or get anyone offended with this post. i\\'m just curious to see what this community thinks of Krishna\\'s whole portrayal in this game. is it faithful to his origins or not? is this offensive or are these just silly video games that shouldn\\'t be taken seriously?

These are some common questions that people have.\\n\\n1. Why do I need to study the Vedas?\\n2. Is a guru really necessary?\\n3. Is it possible to gain self-knowledge without the Vedas or a guru?\\n4. What exactly is the role of a guru?\\n5. How do I choose a guru?\\n\\n## Necessity of Vedas\\n\\nIs it possible to gain self-knowledge without Vedas and Guru?\\n\\nYes.  Just look at people like Ramana Maharishi.\\n\\nBut that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary.  Why?\\n\\nEven today, we are still exploring and gaining knowledge about things we can see and observe: the external world and our body.  You can imagine the challenge in exploring something beyond the range of the senses, beyond time and space!\\n\\nLet\\'s briefly examine knowledge itself (this is called epistemology, or pramana-shastra).  Four points to note:\\n\\n1. **Locus** (where knowledge happens): Knowledge is gained by the mind/intellect.  Not anywhere else.\\n2. **Nature**: Since knowledge takes place in the mind/intellect, the knowledge is in the form of a thought or vritti.\\n3. **Instrument** (pramanam): We need an instrument to gather knowledge.  Our sense organs are the main instruments, followed by secondary sources, like inference and textbooks.\\n4. **Object of study**: Anything I want to know about - atom or planet or whatever.\\n\\nAll knowledge is gained exactly this way.  The only thing that changes is the object of study.  For astronomy, we study the stars and planets with our eyes.  For music, we study or train with our ears.\\n\\nFor self-knowledge we need to study ourselves.  This turns out to be a special case.  Why?  All of our sense organs are turned outward to study objects.  Just like a camera cannot photograph itself, and the eye cannot see itself, I find that all the instruments (pramanam) that I have are incapable of studying the witness Self.  So what do I need?  A mirror.  The Vedas are that mirror, that teach us about ourselves.\\n\\nNote that it is not possible to verify the information presented by one instrument with another.  You cannot verify the color red with any sense organ except the eye.  Similarly, I cannot verify the teaching of the Vedas through any other means.  So what can I do?  Trust, but verify.\\n\\n## Necessity of a Guru\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I study the Vedas by myself and understand the truth?  Only the guru has the key to properly extract the teaching and explain it to you.  The Self is extremely subtle and hard to grasp.  This knowledge is not regular knowledge about objects, but special knowledge about the subject.  The Vedas use peculiar methods to teach us about the Self.  For example, [Kena Upanishad 2.11](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/kena-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145050.html) doesn\\'t make much sense at first glance.\\n\\n>yasyāmataṃ tasya mataṃ mataṃ yasya na veda saḥ |  \\n>  \\n>avijñātaṃ vijānatāṃ vijñātamavijānatām || 11 ||  \\n>  \\n>Kena 2.11. It is Known to him to whom it is Unknown;. he knows it not to whom it is known. (It is) Unknown to those who know, and Known to those who do not know. (11)\\n\\nWithout proper guidance, it is very difficult to decode and understand the teachings, so a guru is necessary for Vedic study.  Now how did this guru get the knowledge?  The guru will say he learnt it from his guru, and give the credit to the guru-parampara, going back all the way to Narayana or Shiva.\\n\\nThe necessity of a guru is stressed in the scriptures themselves.\\n\\n[Mundaka 1.2.12](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mundaka-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc145096.html) says that once a person is ready to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, he should seek out a teacher.\\n\\n>parīkṣya lokānkarmacitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛtaḥ kṛtena |  \\n>  \\n>tadvijñānārthaṃ sa gurumevābhigacchetsamitpāṇiḥ śrotriyaṃ brahmaniṣṭham || 12 ||  \\n>  \\n>Mundaka 1.2.12 Let a Brahmin having examined the worlds produced by karma be free from desires, thinking, ‘there is nothing eternal produced by karma?; and in order to acquire the knowledge of the eternal, let him Samid (sacrificial fuel) in hand, approach a preceptor alone, who is versed in the Vedas and centered in the Brahman.\\n\\n[Chandogya 6.14.2](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239324.html) says that a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge.\\n\\n>tasya yathābhinahanaṃ pramucya prabrūyādetāṃ diśaṃ gandhārā etāṃ diśaṃ vrajeti sa grāmādgrāmaṃ pṛcchanpaṇḍito medhāvī gandhārānevopasampadyetaivamevehācāryavānpuruṣo veda tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye\\'tha sampatsya iti || 6.14.2 ||  \\n>  \\n>Chandogya 6.4.2 And as someone may remove that person’s blindfold and say, ‘Gandhāra is this way; go this way,’ and the intelligent man goes from one village to another, asking his way and relying on the information people give, until he reaches Gandhāra; similarly, a person who gets a teacher attains knowledge. His delay is only as long as he is not free of his body. After that he becomes merged in the Self.\\n\\nIn [Bhagavad Gita 4.34](https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=4&field_nsutra_value=34&etsiva=1&etpurohit=1&etgb=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&etassa=1&etradi=1&etadi=1), Krishna says that self-knowledge cannot be realized without guidance from a qualified guru.\\n\\n>tadviddhi praṇipātēna paripraśnēna sēvayā |  \\n>  \\n>upadēkṣyanti tē jñānaṁ jñāninastattvadarśinaḥ || 4.34||  \\n>  \\n>BG 34. May you gain that (knowledge) by prostration, by service, and by proper enquiry. The wise sages will impart (that) knowledge to you.\\n\\n## Who is a guru?\\n\\nOK, who is a guru?  Some people say Atma is the guru, so I can just learn through the Atma.  But Atma does not have a mouth, or mind, or intellect.  If Atma is capable of teaching, you should have gained self-knowledge a long time ago, since the Atma has been with you for countless births!\\n\\nSome others say, the World is my guru; the whole world is my University.  But it is possible to learn different things from the same event, so how can I be sure I learnt the right lesson?\\n\\nA guru is one who imparts teaching from the Shastras to a student.  That is the reason that all the Upanishads are in the form of guru-sishya samvada - dialog between a teacher and a student.  Bhagavad Gita itself is a Krishna-Arjuna dialog.  Note that it is implicit that these are two live people - a live guru and a live student, so a \"dialog\" is possible.\\n\\nNote: in this internet age, physical co-location may not be necessary.  It may also be possible to gain most teachings through recorded lectures, instead of live learning.\\n\\nWhat is the role of a guru?  He facilitates Jnana Yoga - a consistent and systematic study of the scriptures over a period of time under the guidance of a competent teacher.\\n\\n1. **Shravanam** \\\\- study: We first understand what the Vedas tell us.\\n2. **Mananam** \\\\- removal of doubts / conviction: Once there is teaching, there are bound to be doubts.  The student raises the doubt and the teacher clarifies, just like in the Gita, Krishna answers multiple questions from Arjuna.\\n3. **Nidhidyasanam** \\\\- integration of knowledge: The third stage - information must result in self-transformation.  Be warned: this can be a slow process and can take a long time - many years or even many lifetimes.\\n\\nThis process is described in [Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.4.5](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc117950.html).  Note the use of word \"strotavya\" - to be heard from a teacher, and not to be \"read\" from a book.\\n\\n>ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyāsitavyo maitreyi, ātmano vā are darśanena śravaṇena matyā vijñānenedaṃ sarvaṃ viditam || 5 ||  \\n>  \\n>Brihadaranyaka 2.4.5 (partial) The Self, my dear Maitreyī, should be realised—should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon. By the realisation of the Self, my dear, through hearing, reflection and meditation, all this is known.\\n\\nNote: A guru may be able to help you in many other ways, but providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\\n\\n## How do I find a guru?\\n\\nCan you advertise a job opening for a guru?  No.  It is not easy to search for and find a guru.  Even if you find someone, you may not know if he is a qualified guru, since only a true jnani can recognize another jnani.  This is where Isvara\\'s grace is necessary.\\n\\nSankaracharya says in [Vivekachudamani verse 3](https://www.shankaracharya.org/vivekachudamani1.php):\\n\\n>Vivekachudamani 3. These are three things which are rare indeed and are due to the grace of God - namely, a human birth, the longing for Liberation, and the protecting care of a perfected sage.\\n\\nSo is my situation hopeless?  Am I doomed to be without a guru?  It may appear so, but consider it Isvara\\'s job to find you a guru.  Trust in the divine and be patient.  As the saying goes, \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\"\\n\\nThank you for reading.', 'Great post! This is especially important \"But that is the exception to the rule; for most people, a guru is necessary. Why?\"\\n\\nA simple analogy can also the point: Thomas Edison was perhaps one of the most prolific inventors. He had over 1000 patents to his name and his influence has been so great that the entire world is indebted to him for every aspect of our modern life. And he never went to college and didn\\'t even finish school. \\n\\nBased on this story, you can\\'t conclude that we can simply ignore schooling and can all become great inventors. There are and have always been self-made geniuses who through a combination of their previous merits, their social circumstances and through divine grace can attain great heights even without formal instruction. That however doesn\\'t apply for the overwhelming majority of us.\\n\\nThere is however one distinction to be made in your post. \"providing scriptural knowledge is the main role.\" This is true for Vedanta of all stripes. It\\'s not however true for those who follow the Agamas (Tantras). In that system, the Guru is much much more than one who provides scriptural knowledge; in fact, that role is not primary.', 'Are sadhguru, ram dev, sri sri gurus?

I count myself among that latter group. we are outliers.\\n\\nHinduism can have many traditional values and rules. but dogma is not necessary to be Hindu. there will be disagreements by traditionalists, as always, but Hindu Worship is a completely personal thing and you get to decide HOW you worship for yourself. whatever you do in Devotion to God is correct worship to Hindus.\\n\\nI hope this helps. my stepdad, adji, and aunt Sita are all Hindu, though not very observant. my stepdad didn\\'t raise me to be Hindu, though I grew up with Hindu stories, and there are statues and pictures all over the house of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Krishna, Radha, Rama and Sita. mostly Shiva. my brother collects Ganesh imagery at his house. I have come to Hinduism after a long exploration of other religions since my teens. ', \"Hinduism is difficult to understand in few short paras or even book. For example, many hindus will refute your claim about it being polytheistic, stating all those gods/demi-gods etc are just manifestation of one power which is formless and attribute-less (some hindus will claim one god but with attribute and form instead).

Cant answer about 'meaning' of life but goal of life is considered to be evolution of soul and escape from cycle of birth and death.\\n\", 'Hi! Thanks for your questions. They\\'re good ones. The starting place, I think, is that Hinduism is a grouping of several different religious traditions. My religious tradition, Vaishnavism, is *monotheistic*, not polytheistic. I believe in one all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, ever-present, eternal, God. Vaishnavism itself is a very large and diverse Hindu religion, with a few sub-denominations. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, God is called Vishnu. But, we believe God has innumerable names. These names are descriptive, and they also apply to different expressions of God\\'s personality. For example, Vishnu and Krishna are both the same individual (God) in two different contexts. \"Krishna\" means \"dark,\" and also \"all-attractive\" in Sanskrit. Our scriptures say he has skin the color of a storm cloud, [like this](http://wallpaper.krishoonetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Krishna-Murli.jpg). And Krishna has many descriptive names, like Gopal (which means protector of the cows), based on his activities and characteristics. \\n\\nFor Vaishnavas, entities like Ganesh are pretty much separate from God. We consider Ganesh to be mortal, not all-powerful, not all-knowing, and not perfect. \\n\\nMy tradition is Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which is a denomination within Vaishnavism.For us, the meaning of life is *not* dharma (duty), artha (wealth), kama (sense enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). For us, these are all fine pursuits for a materialistically-focused life. However, the ultimate goal for spiritualists is [*bhakti*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti): reviving your individual, eternal, loving relationship with the divine.    \\n\\nReincarnation is an important part of each individual\\'s journey, but it can be a big topic. What do you want to know about it? \\n\\nFood: In my tradition, vegetarianism is very important. The idea is that, as we work to develop love for ourselves, other living entities, and God, we start to want to cause as little harm and suffering to others as possible. The unnecessary eating of animals is a barrier to uncovering deep compassion and love because it is an inherently uncompassionate act.\\n\\nDoes that help? Let me know if I can answer anything else.', 'I am stating my humble opinions after reading multiple hindu texts (Eknath Eshwaran\\'s books available in Amazon are good read, and so is the \"World Religions by Houston Smith\"). Good luck if you are able to understand and comprehend - for one Hinduism is really complex and left to lots of interpretation.\\n\\nHinduism is very complex... It can\\'t be called as a pure religion. It is a combination of - religion, social practices and regionally influenced complex beliefs - all packaged into one.\\n\\nIn simple terms, it is probably the only religion which has 2 aspects to it... \\n\\n1) external aspect - gods(Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma), their incarnations in million forms, demi-gods (Indra, Varuna, Yama,...) holy books (vedas), rituals,... this aspect of hinduism was pretty much brought in with them by invading Indo-Aryan tribes. Lots of similarities existed with Greek religions from the past. Society was divided based on skin color and occupation even way back 3000 years ago, probably done by Indo-Aryans to segregate the subjugated natives who had darker skin. To keep their identity and superiority over the masses, Indo-Aryans categorized themselves into 2 types of superior humans - Kshatriyas (fighters) and Brahmans (Priests). All natives were tagged as \"shudras or untouchables\". Those who mediated between Indo-Aryans and Natives were called \"Vaishyas or businessmen\". Vedas were considered as the holy books and its knowledge was kept a close secret (education happened only between Brahmans to Brahmans and verbally). It was written in vedas and later reinforced and propagated by 10th century AD Brahman sage called Adhishankara that, after death only Brahman\\'s can attain salvation (or Moksha) automatically. Kshatriyas can also attain salvation after death if they did \"Yagas or rituals\" employing Brahmans and did animal sacrifices (horses and snakes were popular) during their life. Shudras and Vaishyas can never attain salvation; and will be reborn as either Shudras/Vaishyas if they did sins in their current birth or as Brahmans/Kshatriyas if they did good deeds. Everyone can worship the 3 superior gods (Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma) or their incarnations. I am sure your head is spinning by now... This is being followed ditto to this date. This part of hinduism resulted in caste system in India.\\n\\n2) internal focused (also called Brahmavidhya) - agnostic to gods, and focused on individuals consciousness... Meditation & Yoga. This was pre-dated before Indo-Aryans invasion. There are proofs that Indus Valley Civilization that existed before the genesis of current day hinduism had practiced yoga&meditation. Brahmavidhya states that each individual must be viewed as an \"Atman or self\" and people through yoga&mediation can discover their inner consciousness or Atman (level 1). If they persist and continue with their self discovery the next level will be transcending their individualism, and become one with the omnipresent thing or as some people call as Godliness. Very rarely people have attained this stage, by when they would be called Rishis or Yogis or Seers or Buddhas. Notable ones who were able to transcend their consciousness were Krishna, Gautama Buddha,... Ironically both were made gods by the followers of Hinduism who probably didn\\'t understand the intricacies of Brahmavidhya. UPPANISHADS and BHAGAVAT GITA are excellent reads to understand this aspect (internal aspect) of Hinduism.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI believe most Hindus (about 98%) who live today follow the external form of hinduism dominated by superstition, rituals, idol worship, bow to brahminical superiority (Shankaracharyas).\\nThe tiny minority who practice or believe in Brahmavidhya are well respected by the 98% and in some cases are elevated to the levels of incarnations of gods or godmen. Ex: Ramana Maharishi, Saibabas,...\\n\\n', 'Only a quick rundown of what you asked -\\n\\nMain Gods: Krishna (Supreme Personality of Godhead), Vishnu (direct or first incarnation of Krishna), Indra (God of the highest heavenly planet), Brahma (Creator of the universe), Siva (Destroyer of everything), Ganesh (God of wealth)\\n\\nFood: Stay away from meat; all living entities are equal. Dairy is holy because cows are sacred. Offer your food to the god you wish to please (offering to Krishna pleases all the gods).\\n\\nReincarnation: Your next vessel is a result of the karma (action) of this life and previous lives. You can overcome reincarnation by returning to Godhead/Krishnaloka/Vaikuntha.\\n\\nThe meaning of life, in my opinion, is to live for Krishna and create a better world for all living entities.', 'Why was Kurukshetra chosen for the Mahabharata war? The history & Geography of the times & the rise of Non Vedic tribes post MahabharataKurukshetra lied at the head of the region under the Kuru empire called the “Brahmavarta” or the home of Brahma. This land which lay between the erstwhile Saraswati & Drishdhavati rivers was considered as highly sacred, holy & important because not just the Bharata the predecessor to the Kuru dynasty established his capital & thus kingdom within this area but also the holy Vedas were compose in this region of Brahmavarta & kurukshetra which was the head of this sacred region was given the highest regard. Although it was once the one of densest regions in the entire neighbourhood the rivers of Saraswati & Drishdhavati had started drying up around the period of Mahabharata leading to thining out of the population especially the cities located nearby the lower reaches of the river channel. \\n\\nAlso the territory of the Kurus was divided by Dhritrashtra between the Pandavas & Kauravas wherein the region between the East of Yauna & West of Ganga went to Duryodhana & thus Kauravas, the Pandavas got the territories between the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & since the land of Brahmavarta was sacred to both, this area remained neutral.\\n\\nThus even as the Pandavas lost control of their territories later in the game of dice, it was their former territories that was between  the West of Yamuna & East of Dhrisdhavati & within it their major cities/village that they initially claimed back.\\n\\nHence two reasons that possibly emerge why the land of Kurukshetra was chosen for this ancient epic battle:\\n\\n1. It was neutral land for both Kauravas & Pandavas\\n\\n2. The land was the most sacred for the Kuru’s & hence considered appropriate  for fighting what each of them considered a holy/just war.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso post war like in any big war the current big power (which in this case was the Kuru) declines & is replaced by an upcoming power which in this case of Magadha.

I wish to share some of my thoughts on this.\\n\\nLast year’s super bowl champions the Denver Broncos will no longer have gimpy Payton Manning. \\n[In March of 2016, Villanova defeated North Carolina University in a clutch buzzer beater](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15137367/kris-jenkins-title-winning-shot-illustrated-how-villanova-played-all-season) winning the championship after 31 years. To me the more interesting story is [the reaction of the Villanova coach Jay Wright](https://v.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/7F15D7710A1328979325345001472_57033372a1759e6248651a8.mp4?versionId=73Od93RykRg4hTga4MEMKeVVTHZ0vyVh). The coach shows no tension, no emotions, no celebrations, no nothings. He may as well be taking a stroll in the park. It is not difficult to imagine such a coach training his team to keep their emotions under check for clutch performance.\\n\\nOf course there are numerous youtube videos of players including phenomenal ones costing their teams the game because they failed to keep their emotions under check and started celebrating early. One of the prime examples of this Desean Jackson of UCLA. He is a freakishly fast player who had several phenomenal plays. [But then there were also several faceplants just because he had not learnt to master his emotions and celebrated too early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5s8F2u8LUE).\\n\\n\\nIn the superbowl the Denver Broncos scored an important touchdown, the story (to me) was not Bronco’s quarterback Payton Manning or Carolina’s QB Cam Newton but Payton’s little brother [Eli Manning’s reaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TksBqgwEm6E). There was zero reaction on his face. While Payton Manning is a better athlete and is considered a better QB, Eli Manning has had more clutch performances including winning 2 superbowls and [defeating an undefeated New England Patriot team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn278VqvJ4E)\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita or the divine ballad says unequivocally to have emotions under control and maintain equipoise. \\n\\nEquanimity keeps ego under check which is a critical step in the pathway to God. We Hindus believe that ego needs to be sacrificed at the altar of God. However, this might not be the only advantage of maintaining equipoise or equanimity in emotions. Keeping the emotions under check regardless of circumstances are important for outstanding achievements and results in everyday life. \\n\\nHere are some of the other verses of Gita on equipoise\\n\\n2-2 : *Perform your activities without attachment and have equipoise in both success and failure*\\n\\n6-9: *More spiritual is he who acts equally towards all friends, foes and disputers alike*\\n\\n6.7: *One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self.* \\n\\n6.8- *A yogi is called Self-realized who is satisfied with knowledge and understanding of the Self, who is equanimous, who has control over the senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same.*']\n",
