    <h1>Meta Interview UX Research (Ph.D. Position)</h1>

    <p>

        Disclaimer : I recently recived and accepted a summer internship offer for the role of a Qualitative UX Researcher.
        This article is a pure reflection of my opinions, strategies and a collection of material that helped me. This does
        not reflect the opinions of any other individual or organization. Details I will be sharing would be general in nature 
        and will not revel specifics about reserach, product features 
    </p>
    <h2>A Little Background!</h2>

    <p >
      I did my Undergraduate in Computer Engineering at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology. During my undergraduate, I have had my internships at GeorgiaTech,
      Indian Institute of Science, Invento Robotics and National Innovation Foundation, India. I am an avid coder and love building products, making robots (check out my projects page), and regularly making hobby projects.
      I have my interests in research and have always emphasized "people first" development. My first experience with UX was at NIF India with Dr.Anil Gupta (IIM-A). 
      Professor Gupta really introduced me to User Experience, Empathy based development. Fast forward today, I am a Ph.D. student at UCSC under the Department of Computational Media. 
      This article primarily discusses my interview experience with Meta for a Summer UX Researcher at Melon Park HQ.

    </p>

    <h2 >CV Preparation!</h2>

    <p >
      During my undergraduate time, I used to spend applying for jobs, I was primarily applying for Software Engineering roles.
      My CV was heavily Software, Robotics, and AI-focused. Though we performed a lot of UX research work at my previous workplaces
      I made my CV highly inclined to Software roles. After I came down for a Ph.D. I had multiple copies of my CV, each dedicated to
      different roles I could apply to. I have shared the CV I used for the Meta internship application in the NavBar on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>Interview Round 1</h2>

    <p>
      I had initial email conversations about the interests roles I would be interested in. 
      After a series of emails, the recruiter scheduled my first round of interviews (for a Qualitative Research Intern Role).
      The interview was a one-hour interview. The interview tested my UX research skills. 
      The questions had nothing much to do with my research or previous work. 
      The questions tested the fundamentals of UX research. Preparing for this interview, I would recommend understanding your research methods perfectly. Learn the pros and cons of every research method. Try to talk to yourself about validating your choice of research method. The interviewer will be really friendly and try to assess your options for given situations. You would be put into situations and asked to pick a research method to handle the situation. The interviewer is looking to understand why you choose that research method over other research methods. Here are a few resources to brush up on your UX research methods and better understand the pros and cons of each research method.

      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/">NN Group</a>     
    <p>
        This is possibly the best resource on the internet for developing a solid foundation for UX research. The NNGroup has tons of things
        for you to study about both Qualitative and Quantitative Research. I would recommend making notes and keep revising.
        </p>

      <a  href="http://guidetouxr.com/">Guide to UX Research</a>     
      <p >
        This is a fantastic resource that organizes multiple resources for each research method. I used this resource frequently to revise and develop an overall perspective of things.
      </p>

      <a  href="https://www.userinterviews.com/">userinterviews.com</a>     
      <p >
        Do not get confused by the misleading name! This resource contains a whole lot more than just User Interviews! The Field guides on this website are amazingly written.
    </p>

    <h2 >Interview Round 2 (Final Round)</h2>
    <p >
      The recruiter reached out nearly 1 month after the first interview (Honestly, I lost all hope by then). 
      The email said they would like to have one final round of interviews. The format of this interview was shared. 
      The interview would be one hour in time, where the first 30 minutes I could present one of my research projects, and the next 30 minutes would be Questions from the Panel. 
      I am not allowed to share my research presentation because it is currently under review for acceptance at ACM CHI Play 2022. 
      BUT! I will be sharing some insights into what I think goes behind choosing which research project to present and what you should consider while presenting.
    </p>
    <p >
      1) Understand the role you are applying for. Students in UX research often find it tempting to bring their most colorful and prettiest-looking project to showcase. But this ideally would not work. Established firms have their design principles established, so it ideally would make less significance if your project is aesthetically well designed. Instead, focus on presenting projects with a variety of research methods. For example, "In this project, I developed "
      <br>
      <br>
      2) Share the product's story with joy and happiness instead of giving a lecture about it. 
      <br><br>
      3) Show how each research method you used came out with a good or bad tangible outcome. For example, "I conducted a Card Sorting exercise with my internal stakeholders and realized that ___ and ___ were essential. This resulted in ___ and ___."
      <br><br>      
      4) Be very transparent in how you would have improved if you had another chance at the same product. For example, "If I had more time, I would have performed a Diary Study for ___ and ___ reasons."
      <br><br>
      5) If you have worked in a team, be clear on your role and explain how you are a good team player. 
      <br><br>
      6) Make the slides simple, so most of the attention is on you instead of your slides. 
      <br><br>
      7) The questions after your interview mainly assess how you would fit into the work environment and execute different research methods based on other constraints. The questions would also be on the project you presented. The timeline of your project, alternative approaches you would have taken to execute the same project with different restrictions or unlimited resources.
