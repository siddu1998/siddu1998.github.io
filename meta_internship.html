  What research methods can be used and executed to 
  identify futuristic opportunities for Facebook's Home?</h1>

<hr>




<div id="empathize" style="display: block;">
 

    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color:#1773EB">What users want to see and when?</h1>
   
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black"> Designing intuitive interfaces and experiences enables users to grasp and establish a rhythm in their product usage. Through this research method, we seek to understand how time can serve as a determining factor in identifying participants' product preferences. </p>

    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color:#1773EB">Introducing Research Method - Time Loop: </h1>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">The Time Loop method involves placing participants in different scenarios throughout the day and discussing how the product or application can assist them during those times. We displayed visual cues individually, as illustrated in Figure 1, prompting users to discuss how Facebook Home could benefit them at various moments in their day. We posed questions like: <em style="color: #666;">"It's this time of the day, and you open the Facebook app; what would you like to see?"</em> The semi-structured interviews were tailored to participants' occupations, allowing us to adjust certain questions for greater context and relevance. For instance, we asked a university student: <em style="color: #666;">"After a busy day, you return home in the evening and settle on the couch. You open Facebook. What would you hope to find?".</em> </p>
    <h2 class="w3-xlarge" style="color:green">Pros: </h2>
    <ul class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
      <li>This approach emphasizes user routines, highlighting how a product can seamlessly integrate into their day-to-day lives. One participant remarked, "<em style="color: #666;">I'd like to see the weather on Facebook Home first thing in the morning.</em>"</li>
      <li>It facilitates the identification of patterns, generating themes from the diverse experiences and features participants discuss. A participant shares "<em style="color: #666;">I really do not like to seen anything negative, I would love maybe spread some positivity, showing whose birthday it is and an easy way to share birthdays would be really good.</em>"</li>
      <li>This method strongly centers the user, empowering them to articulate their preferences and desires. For instance college student shares,"<em style="color: #666;">Ahh, while going to bed, it would be nice to see some positive affirmations to wind down, You have stories and reels right now, but sometimes I feel I get overwhelmed.</em>" </li>
      <li>While time remains a primary factor, this technique also unveils other considerations shaping user experiences based on what they frequently do. For instance, a participant noted, "<em style="color: #666;">I'm not keen on viewing Reels while traveling, especially if my headphones aren't connected and mostly when I travel back from Office</em>"</li>
  </ul>
  
    <h2 class="w3-xlarge" style="color:red">Cons: </h2>
    <ul class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
      <li>Participants might not be interested in seeing a variety of experiences in a product and might not be vocal. If this happens, try asking them to talk 
        through their day, and reference activities they perform throughout their day 
        when probing into how Facebook Home can help them in their activity. </li>
      <li>For a researcher, it might appear that the participant wants the entire 
        Facebook app on Facebook Home. Do not stop/interrupt the participant when they are 
        sharing such ideas. Focus on quantity over quality at this point. Distill and filter ideas as part of your analysis process.</li>
    </ul>
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="temporary/images/time_loop.png">
    <label style="padding:10%;">Figure 1: Illustration of what was presented to the participants while executing Time Loop research method</label>
    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color:#1773EB">How do you feel and what do you want to see?</h1>
 
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black"> Facebook serves a multitude of purposes beyond merely entertainment and connection. Given its diverse use cases, it's crucial for Facebook to cater to various emotional states. With this approach, we seek to understand how a product can address and support different emotional contexts. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color:#1773EB">Introducing Research Method - Feeling Cues</h1>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
      Keyword cues is a method in which we present participants with various emotional states and inquire about how a product might facilitate or resonate with the given emotional state or intent. To assist participants in contemplating and discussing potential content for Facebook Home, we provided visual cues, as depicted below. Participants encountered questions like, <em style="color: #666;">"What could we display on Facebook Home that would make you feel or connect with [presented keyword]?"</em>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="w3-xlarge" style="color:green">Pros: </h2>
      <ul class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
        <li>This approach enables us to discern the types of content and formats that resonate with users, guiding them towards specific emotions.</li>
        <li>From the subjects and interests of participants, we can curate themes that bolster their emotional connection. For instance, some expressed a desire to see content from friends and family on TOH to evoke feelings of love and security. Another sentiment shared was the appreciation of positive mental health quotes on TOH, especially after a taxing workday.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="w3-xlarge" style="color:red">Cons: </h2>
    <ul class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
      <li>When participants provide brief answers about their preferences, it's essential to probe further. For instance, if someone mentions they enjoy "puppy content" because of the happiness it brings, ask them about the specific type they prefer: videos, reels, or stories. Additionally, seek clarity on why such content appeals to them.</li>
      <li>Since emotions are inherently subjective, formulating overarching themes can prove challenging.</li>
      <li>Determining the optimal moment to address a certain emotion can be intricate. Rather than using this method to pinpoint when to present specific experiences, employ it to discern the types of experiences users might value.</li>
  </ul>

        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Cultural stakeholders emphasize that it is important to stick to the scriptures and original narratives.</li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Stakeholders suggest that creative liberty with gods from active religion should not be taken. Instead they suggest sticking to the original narrative and use fictional characters for gameplay.</li>

    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color: #F89B72;">Opportunities and Questions</h1>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
        Having discussed with stakeholders we realize that there is a large design space in Hindu mythology that can be leveraged.
        But this does not come at the cost of copying original gods. Stakeholders suggest that we can take granular elements form
        Hindu mythology and create new aesthetics and characters. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">How do we identify granular elements from Mythology?</li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">How do we present these granular elements to designers?</li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Can we create novel video game characters using these granular elements?</li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Are the characters that are created using these granular elements culturally sensitive?</li>

    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">As an alternative to god transplantation,
         We employ <mark>Ethnography</mark>  and <mark>Grounded Theory</mark>  as research methods to develop granular artifacts that support the creation of characters. 
         We hypothesize that combining artifacts (syntagms) allows the creation of novel and sensitive characters. We take the following research approach:</p>

        This distribution allows designers to pick suitable syntagms from the respective paradigms for character creation.  
        Designers are allowed to select any number of syntagms and arrange them to create characters. </p>

    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color: #F89B72;">Participatory Design Workshop</h1>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">To verify designers could use the design space to create new characters, we conducted a participatory design workshop with game designers as stakeholders. 
        Game designers were evaluated and were requested to create characters using the design space.
         Each participant was requested to create 2 characters. </p>

    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color: #F89B72;">Quantitative Framework to Evaluate Character Novelty</h1>

    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">The syntagm and paradigm approach towards the design space allows to represent characters as a vector representation.
         The frequency of each syntagm in an entry into the vector.
         This vector acts as an embedding for the character and provides us an opportunity to compare characters using distance metrics. </p>

            <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black"><mark>Participant generated characters are unique in terms of their physical appearance</mark> (p<0.05, d>0.8).
