    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color:#1773EB">What users want to see and when?</h1>
    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black"> Designing predictable interfaces and experiences allows users to understand and develop a rhythm in how they use a product. Through this method we aim to uncover how time can act as a control variable to determine what participants want in a product.     </p>
    <h2>Method: </h2>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Time Loop is a method where we put participants in situations across various times of the day and discuss how the product/application can help them with tasks at various parts of the day. 
      We presented visual cues (one at a time), as shown (in the image below), to have users talk about how Facebook Home can help with what they’re doing at various times of the day. Participants were asked questions of the following nature: "It's <this time of the day>, and you open the Facebook app; what would you like to see here?". Since it was a semi-structured interview based on participants’ occupations, we modified certain questions to give them more context and situational awareness. For example, a university student was asked, "After a busy day, you come back home in the evening and relax on the couch. Imagine you open Facebook. What would you like to see here?" </p>
    <h2>Pros: </h2>
    <ul class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
      <li> This method highlights user routines and how a product can fit into their daily routines and lives. For example, a participant shared they would like to see 
        weather on Facebook Home as the first thing in the morning. </li>
       <li> It helps identify patterns and generate themes around the different experiences and features participants share. </li>
      <li>This method strongly advocates for the user and keeps them in the driver's seat to indicate what they want to see. </li>
      <li> Despite using time as a driving factor, this method allows us to gain insights into other factors that can determine which experience to present to users. For example, a participant shared they would not be interested in seeing Reels 
        while traveling or if they do not have their headphones connected.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Cons: </h2>
    <ul class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
      <li>Participants might not be interested in seeing a variety of experiences in a product and might not be vocal. If this happens, try asking them to talk 
        through their day, and reference activities they perform throughout their day 
        when probing into how Facebook Home can help them in their activity. </li>
      <li>For a researcher, it might appear that the participant wants the entire 
        Facebook app on Facebook Home. Do not stop/interrupt the participant when they are 
        sharing such ideas. Focus on quantity over quality at this point. Distill and filter ideas as part of your analysis process.</li>
    </ul>
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="temporary/images/time_loop.png">
    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color:#1773EB">How do you feel and what do you want to see?</h1>
    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black"> Facebook has multiple use cases and is not just used for entertainment and connection. For that purpose, it is important Facebook supports multiple emotional states. Through this method we aim to uncover how a product can serve different emotional situations. 
    </p>
    <h2>Method: </h2>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
      Key word cues is a method where we present participants 
      with different emotional states and ask them to describe how a product would help them experience the displayed emotional state or intent. To help participants think through and talk about what we can 
      show on Facebook Home, we presented visual cues as shown below. Participants were asked questions such as, "What is it we can show on here (i.e. Facebook Home) that would make you experience or resonate with [presented keyword]" 
      </p>
        <h2>Pros: </h2>
    <ul class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
      <li> This method helps us understand different content and formats we can present to users to help them imagine a certain emotion. </li>
       <li> We can generate themes from participants’ topics and interests to support their feelings. For example, participants were interested in having friends and family content presented on TOH to make them feel loved and safe. Another example is how certain participants shared having positive mental health quotes on TOH after a busy day of work would be useful for them.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Cons: </h2>
    <ul class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
      <li>Participants might share one-word answers in terms of what they would like to see. For example, participants might share that "puppy content" would 
        make them feel happy. Probe further into what kind of puppy content they 
        would like. Would they like to see videos, reels, or stories? Probe further into 
        why puppy content makes them happy. 
         </li>
      <li>Emotions are relative to each individual, making it potentially tricky to generate more generalized themes. </li>
      <li>Deciding when to support which emotion can become difficult to determine. Do not use this method to identify factors to help determine when to present 
        experiences to users; instead, use this method to generate which types of 
        experiences can be presented to users. </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Cultural stakeholders do not encourage copying gods into video games.</li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Cultural stakeholders emphasize that it is important to stick to the scriptures and original narratives.</li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Stakeholders suggest that creative liberty with gods from active religion should not be taken. Instead they suggest sticking to the original narrative and use fictional characters for gameplay.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color: #F89B72;">Opportunities and Questions</h1>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">
        Having discussed with stakeholders we realize that there is a large design space in Hindu mythology that can be leveraged.
        But this does not come at the cost of copying original gods. Stakeholders suggest that we can take granular elements form
        Hindu mythology and create new aesthetics and characters. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">How do we identify granular elements from Mythology?</li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">How do we present these granular elements to designers?</li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Can we create novel video game characters using these granular elements?</li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Are the characters that are created using these granular elements culturally sensitive?</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="w3-center w3-xxxlarge">Ideate</h1>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">As an alternative to god transplantation,
         We employ <mark>Ethnography</mark>  and <mark>Grounded Theory</mark>  as research methods to develop granular artifacts that support the creation of characters. 
         We hypothesize that combining artifacts (syntagms) allows the creation of novel and sensitive characters. We take the following research approach:</p>

    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Visiting temples we collected a <mark>total of 
        429 images</mark>. Of the 429 images, 
        248 images were images of idols, 
        63 images consisted of ongoing rituals, and 
        45 images were miscellaneous objects. </p>

        <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color: #F89B72;">Grounded Theory to create a Syntagm and Paradigm based Character Design space</h1>
    
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">We used grounded theory a research method to create a design space of character creation artifacts. The design space has <mark>141 open codes</mark>, categorized into <mark>22 axial codes</mark>, that finally converging into <mark>4 selective codes.</mark> </p>

    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color: #F89B72;">Presenting the Syntagm and Paradigm based Character Design space</h1>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">We showcase granular elements as syntagm and paradigms. The syntagm and paradigm based design space are displayed as cards on a table. The axial codes act as paradigms. The open codes are the syntagms and are distributed across the paradigms. 
        This distribution allows designers to pick suitable syntagms from the respective paradigms for character creation.  
        Designers are allowed to select any number of syntagms and arrange them to create characters. </p>

<div id="evaluate" style="display: none;">
    <h1 class="w3-center w3-xxxlarge">Evaluate</h1>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">We evaluate the design space on three parameters.<p>
    <ul> 
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Does the design space support the creation of video game characters?</li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Are the generated characters novel and unique?</li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black"> Are the generated characters culturally sensitive? </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black"> We take the following evaluative steps.</p>
    <img src="temporary/images/astraVerse/Group 100.png" style="width: 100%;height: 100%;">
    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color: #F89B72;">Participatory Design Workshop</h1>
    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">To verify designers could use the design space to create new characters, we conducted a participatory design workshop with game designers as stakeholders. 
        Game designers were evaluated and were requested to create characters using the design space.
         Each participant was requested to create 2 characters. </p>
         <img src="temporary/images/astraVerse/Group 101 (1).png" style="width: 100%;height: 100%;">

    <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color: #F89B72;">Quantitative Framework to Evaluate Character Novelty</h1>

    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">The syntagm and paradigm approach towards the design space allows to represent characters as a vector representation.
         The frequency of each syntagm in an entry into the vector.
         This vector acts as an embedding for the character and provides us an opportunity to compare characters using distance metrics. </p>
         <img src="temporary/images/astraVerse/Group 65 (5).png" style="width: 100%;height: 100%;">
         <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">We measure character distances from one central and plot them on a radar chart as shown below. 
            We create two groups of charaters. Group (1) consists of characters copied from the original religious texts and used in games. 
            Group (2) consists of characters created by the participants from the participatory design study.   </p>

         <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">We generate the following insights:</p>
         <ul> 
            <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black"><mark>Participant generated characters are novel when measured across the entire design space</mark> (p<0.05). There is <mark>less overlap between the original gods and participant generated characters </mark> (d>0.8) </li>
            <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black"><mark>Participant generated characters are unique in terms of their physical appearance</mark> (p<0.05, d>0.8). This could be a result of the fact that gods are mostly anthropomorphic in nature, while participant generated gods are a mix of both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic. </li>
            <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black"> A number of original gods are presented as royals resulting in high jewelry and other fashion elements. (p>0.05)</li>
            <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">The anthropomorphic nature of participant characters allows multiple hands and results in them carrying a larger set of weapons (p<0.05,d>0.8). The reverse is true for the game mechanics selective code (p>0.05)</li>

        <h1 class="w3-xlarge" style="color: #F89B72;">Sensitivity Evaluation through Stakeholder Interviews</h1>
        <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">We presented temple priests with characters created by participants and gods copied into video games. They were asked about what aspects of the presented character they found offensive.  Insightful responses are as follows:</p>

        <ul>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black"><mark>Participant generated characters were received positively by cultural stakeholders.</mark> Cultural stakeholders had a strong voice against using original gods in video games. </li>
        <li class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black">Cultural stakeholders were able to identify elements borrowed from the specific mythology but <mark>assured that the characters were fictional and were just using elements from mythology.</mark></li>
