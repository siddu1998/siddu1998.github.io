        <h2>The Challenge & My Approach</h2>
        <div class="two-column">
            <div>
                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>There is a growing presence of religious themes in videogames, but little is understood about how players perceive, discuss, and interact with these themes. This lack of insight creates a gap in understanding how religion influences gaming experiences and how games can meaningfully incorporate religious narratives without causing offense or misrepresentation.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>My Approach</h3>
                <p>This UX research study explored the intersection of religion and videogames by analyzing online discussions within Reddit gaming and religious communities. Using a mixed-methods approach combining Python scripting for data scraping, advanced topic modeling, and qualitative analysis, I uncovered key themes and narratives emerging from player discourse.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>To uncover the nuances at the intersection of religion and videogames, a structured three-step methodology was adopted, focusing on rigor and minimizing bias.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Group 162.png" alt="UXR Pipeline for Religion and Videogames Study">
            <div class="image-caption">UXR pipeline adopted to understand stakeholder perceptions of religion in videogames.</div>
        </div>

        <h3>1. Data Retrieval and Cleaning</h3>
        <p>Data was retrieved using Python's PRAW library to scrape posts and comments from relevant religious (e.g., r/Christianity, r/Islam) and gaming subreddits (e.g., r/pokemon, r/Smite). Keywords like "Christian," "Hindu," "Islam," etc., targeted contextually relevant discussions. The dataset was meticulously refined by removing noise and focusing on discussions around specific games mentioned in relation to religion.</p>

        <h3>2. Topic Modeling with BERTopic</h3>
        <p>BERTopic, a state-of-the-art topic modeling tool leveraging sentence embeddings, was employed to generate context-aware topic clusters from the cleaned text data. This approach allowed for the automatic identification of meaningful themes and the exclusion of outlier comments, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to traditional methods.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Group 774.png" alt="BERTopic output example for Islamic subreddit analysis">
            <div class="image-caption">Example BERTopic output for the r/islam subreddit. Researchers assigned labels to the generated clusters.</div>
        </div>

        <h3>3. Qualitative Analysis & Researcher Validation</h3>
        <p>To ensure human oversight and contextual understanding, a human-in-the-loop methodology was applied. Researchers collaboratively reviewed, interpreted, and labeled the topics generated by BERTopic. This robust process balanced computational efficiency with deep human interpretation.</p>

        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <p>The analysis surfaced 22 distinct sub-themes within online discussions, which were categorized into three primary themes revealing the complex relationship between religious players and videogames:</p>
